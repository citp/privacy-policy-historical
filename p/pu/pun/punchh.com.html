    <p> Punchh does not send Spam or sell email addresses.<br>
      About Punchh and the Information We Collect</p>

      <h4>Profile Information submitted by Members to Punchh</h4>

      <p>Punchh is an online community that connects people through the places they visit and helps them discover places around them.. To accomplish this, each Punchh Member creates his or her own profile, which contains a list of places relevant to the member. This personal information includes such things as:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>First name or first and last names of the Member (depending on the options selected by the Member)</li>
        <li>Location (e.g., city and state), and</li>
        <li>Photos, videos or other shared content uploaded by the Member to his or her profile, to the extent that it includes personal information.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Other Information submitted by Members to Punchh</h4>

      <p>Punchh also collects Member-submitted account information such as name and email address to identify Members, send notifications related to the use of the Punchh service and conduct market research and marketing for Punchh's internal use only.</p>

      <h4>Information Not Directly Submitted by Members or Other Website Users to Punchh</h4>

      <p>Finally, we may also collect some information from Members, as well as from other visitors to the Punchh website, that is not personally identifiable, such as browser type and IP address. This information is gathered from all Members and visitors to the website.</p>

      <h4>Use of Information Obtained by Punchh</h4>

      <h4>Display of Members' Information</h4>

      <p>Except where a Member might choose to include a full name in his or her profile, a Member's email address and full name will only be used in the following circumstances:</p>

      <p>When the Member invites a friend via email to become a Punchh Member,<br>
        When the Member sends a request to another Member to add the other Member to his or her friend list,<br>
        When we send notifications to the Member relating to his or her use of the Punchh service or Punchh website, and<br>
        If the Member so chooses, when we send regular notifications, weekly updates, or other news regarding the Punchh service or the Punchh website.<br>
        Except when inviting or adding friends or as otherwise expressly set forth herein, a Member's email address will never be shared with or displayed to any other person. Members and their friends, and other Members within their personal networks (depending on the level of sharing a Member has chosen) communicate on Punchh with each other through the Punchh service, without disclosing email addresses.</p>

        <h4>Punchh's Use of Members' Information</h4>

        <p>We use information relating to each Member's server information, IP address, and browser-type.</p>

        <h4>Sharing of the Information this Site Gathers/Tracks</h4>

        <p>Except as explained herein, or where you are expressly informed otherwise, we do not sell, rent, share, trade or give away any of your personal information unless required by law or for the protection of your Membership. However, Punchh may share profile information and aggregate usage information in a non-personally identifiable manner with advertisers and other third parties in order to present to Members and other users of the Punchh website more targeted advertising, products and services; provided that, in such situations, we will never disclose information that would personally identify you. As set forth above, Punchh may (i) use your email address to conduct market research for Punchh's internal use only; and/or (ii) use your email address to market Punchh to you (e.g., new features and applications, announcements, opportunities of interest). Punchh may contract with a third party to conduct such research and marketing; provided that such third party will be fully bound by an obligation of confidentiality to Punchh and may not use any personally-identifiable information provided by Punchh other than as expressly instructed by Punchh and in strict compliance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <p>Links</p>

        <p>The Punchh Website contains links to other websites. This includes links that are placed there by Punchh (such as in advertisements), as well as by other Punchh Members. Please be aware that Punchh is not responsible for the privacy practices of any other website. We encourage all Members and other users of the Punchh website to be aware of when they leave our website, and to read the privacy policies of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by Punchh through the Punchh website.</p>

        <h4>Use of Cookies</h4>

        <p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on the Punchh website. However, we do not and will not use cookies to collect private information from any Member or other user of the Punchh website which they did not intentionally submit to us other than as stated in this Privacy Policy. We use both "session ID cookies" and "persistent cookies." We use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. Note also that Members may optionally use a cookie to remember their email in order to automatically log in to our website. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browsers's "help" file; however, please note that, if you reject cookies or disable cookies in your web browser, you may not be able to use the Punchh website.</p>

        <h4>Changes in Our Privacy Policy</h4>

        <p>If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our web site so Members and other users of the Punchh website are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If we are going to use Members' or other users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify those Members and users via email or by placing a prominent notice on our website.</p>

        <h4>Invite a Friend</h4>

        <p>If a Member elects to use our "Invite" feature to invite a friend to become a Member of the Punchh service, we ask them for that friend's email address. Punchh will automatically send the friend an email inviting them to join the site. Punchh stores this email address for the purpose of: (i) automatically adding the respondent to the “friends list” of the Member sending the invitation; (ii) sending reminders of the invitation and (iii) sending emails on recent updates by the Member on Punchh to the Member's invited friend. Punchh will never sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations and invitation reminders. Any person who receives an invitation may contact Punchh to request the removal of this information from our database.</p>

        <h4>Security</h4>

        <p>The Punchh account of every Member is password-protected. Punchh takes every precaution to protect the information of the Members, as well as information collected from other users of the Punchh website. We use industry standard measures to protect all information that is stored on our servers and within our database. We limit the access to this information to those employees who need access to perform their job function such as our customer service personnel. If you have any questions about the security at our website, please contact us.</p>

        <h4>Email Choice/Opt-out</h4>

        <p>Members who no longer wish to receive our weekly email updates or other email notifications may opt-out of receiving these communications by following the instructions contained in the applicable email or by logging-in and changing their settings in the "Account Settings" section of the Punchh website. You can access this page by clicking on the "Settings" link on the top right of your Punchh homepage.</p>

        <h4>Third Party Advertising</h4>

        <p>The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to Members by our Web advertising partners. Our Web advertising partners may use cookie</p>

        <p>Members and Users Located Outside of the United States of America</p>

        <p>We have made an effort to protect the personal information of all Members and other users of the Punchh website, and to the extent applicable, we attempt to comply with local data protection and consumer rights laws. If you are unsure whether this privacy policy is in conflict with the applicable local rules where you are located, you should not submit your personal information to the Punchh website. IN ADDITION, IF YOU ARE LOCATED WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION, YOU SHOULD NOTE THAT YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO THE UNITED STATES, THE LAWS OF WHICH MAY BE DEEMED BY THE EUROPEAN UNION TO HAVE INADEQUATE DATA PROTECTION (see, for example, European Union Directive 95/46/EC of 24 October 1995, a copy of which can be found here). Members and other users of the Punchh website located in countries outside of the United States of America who submit personal information do thereby consent to the general use of such information as provided in this privacy policy and to the transfer of that information to and/or storage of the information in the United States of America.</p>
