# Privacy Policy (Pun of the Day)

Pun of the Day is deeply committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users.

What information do we collect? 

At Pun of the Day, we do not collect information unless you voluntarily send it to us. If you join our mailing list, we keep your e-mail address only as long as you belong to the mailing list. Pun of the Day occasionally asks you to complete surveys or enter contests where we collect information that we use for research. In these cases, aggregate information only is saved beyond the length of the survey or contest. You can be sure that information such as your e-mail address is never sold or passed on to anyone. Your privacy is strictly maintained.

How do we use the information you send us? Pun of the Day stores E-mail addresses only for use on our mailing lists, or during a contest in order to notify the winner. If you unsubscribe from our mailing lists, your e-mail address is not kept. If you give us your e-mail address for any other reason, it will not be saved. Survey or contest information is stored only in the aggregate in order to identify demographic information.

Pun of the Day will not sell, trade, rent or otherwise distribute your e-mail address or other personal information to outside parties, should you join our mailing list or send us submissions or feedback.

Cookies are small pieces of information that some web sites use to store data using your browser on your computer's hard drive. Pun of the Day uses cookies to record which puns visitors have rated. The information is used to ensure that visitors do not vote multiple times for a single pun. No personal information is saved.
