<h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>

Sift Media is the sole owner of the personal information collected from this Website.</p>
<p>Your details are never sold or rented to any third parties. However, where your details are requested in order to download documents from our sponsors, you agree that such details will be provided to the sponsor.</p>

<p>A cookie is a small text file written to your hard drive that contains information about your account on this Website. Cookies do not contain any personal information about users. During the course of your visit to this Website, the pages you see, along with a cookie, are downloaded to your device.

This is done on a repeat visit by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last visit.</p>
<p><strong>How does PublicTechnology.net  use cookies</strong></p>
