Privacy Policy 

The Government of Canada and the National Research Council Canada (NRC) are committed to providing visitors to PubMed Central Canada with web sites that respect their privacy. This page summarizes the privacy policy and practices on National Research Council Canada Web sites.

NRC Web sites do not automatically gather any specific personal information from you, such as your name, phone number or e-mail address. We would only obtain this type of information if you supply it by sending us an e-mail or registering in a secure portion of the site. 

All personal information created, held or collected by this department is protected under the federal [Privacy Act](http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/P-21/index.html). 

NRC employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. This software receives and records the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer that has contacted our Web site, the date and time of the visit and the pages visited. We make no attempt to link these addresses with the identity of individuals visiting our site unless an attempt to damage the site has been detected. 

NRC does not normally use "cookies" to track how our visitors use this site or to determine sites previously visited. The system will notify you before any cookies are used so that you may refuse them. (A "cookie" is a file that may be placed on your hard drive without your knowledge by a Web site to allow it to monitor your use of the site.) 

Information on individual visitors is used by NRC employees who need to know the information in order to respond to your request or to ensure the security of this system. We only share the information you give us with another government department if your inquiry relates to that department. We do not use the information to create individual profiles, nor do we disclose this information to anyone outside the federal government. 

NRC is a participant in the Government of Canada Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), which gives you the opportunity to communicate with the Department in a confidential manner. Access [additional information on PKI](http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pki-icp/index_e.asp) and how to use it.
