Mobile devices that can receive text messages (SMS Service) are generally able to receive text alerts.

_Security/Delivery._ You should keep in mind that most wireless transmissions are not secured. There is a greater risk that an unauthorized third party may intercept your messages or your Personal Information when you use a wireless communications device.

_Potential Charges._ Publix does not charge users for its Wireless Marketing Services. However, your carrier's standard message and data rates may apply. Charges may show up on your mobile bill or may be deducted from your prepaid account. By registering to receive Wireless Marketing Services, you agree that you may be charged by your wireless carrier for any messages that you send to or receive from Publix and that you are solely responsible for such charges. Under no circumstances will Publix be responsible for any wireless email or text messaging charges, whether incurred by you directly or as a result of the activity of another person with access, whether or not authorized, to your wireless device, telephone number, or email address. Please contact your wireless carrier if you have any questions about your wireless service.

_Registration (Opt-in) Methods for Wireless Marketing Services._ The following registration methods are provided for Publix's Wireless Marketing Services.
