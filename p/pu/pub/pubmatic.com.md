**SECTION 1 – WHO WE ARE**

A reference to **“PubMatic** ” “ **we** ” or “ **our** ” means PubMatic, Inc.  and its global subsidiaries including, as of the effective date of this Policy, PubMatic Limited, PubMatic GmbH, PubMatic India Private Limited, パブマティック株式会社 (PubMatic KK), PubMatic Pte.  Ltd.  and 据翼软件科技有限公司 (PubMatic Software (Shanghai)) Limited.

PubMatic provides marketing automation technology via our supply side platform (“ **Platform** ”) and related advertising tools (collectively the “ **Ad Services** ”).  We provide our services and tools to our “ **Clients** ,” which include “ **Publisher Clients** ” who own and operate websites, mobile applications, and other online services (each a “ **Digital Property** ”) and “ **Media Buyers** ” who are advertisers and other ad partners looking to distribute relevant ad content through our Platform.  Our Ad Services help Clients display relevant online advertising to end users (“ **End Users** ”) who interact with Digital Properties that use our Ad Services.

PubMatic also collects information from individuals when they visit, use, or interact with: (i) www.pubmatic.com and other websites operated by us, including PubMatic’s client interfaces (the “ **Websites** ”); (ii) our software applications (the “ **Apps** ”); (iii) our social media pages (our “ **Social Media Pages** ”); and (iv) our sales and marketing activities (collectively, our “ **PubMatic Properties** ”).

**SECTION 2 – PRIVACY FOR OUR AD SERVICES**

This Section describes how we collect and use information we receive from End Users of Digital Properties that use our Ad Services.

**2.1       WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?**

**Information we automatically collect**

When End Users visit a Digital Property that uses our technology, we (and our partners or vendors) use and deploy tracking technologies (see “ **Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies**“) to automatically collect certain information about the End Users and their devices.  Some of this information (including, for example, unique identifiers stored in a cookie or mobile advertising IDs) may identify a particular computer or device and may be “personal data” in some jurisdictions, including the EU.  However, our Ad Services are designed to process information in such a manner that the information cannot be directly attributed to a specific, identifiable individual without the use of additional information (such as your name, address, or email address).

We (and our partners or vendors) may collect this information the first time an End User interacts with a Publisher Client’s Digital Property that uses our Ad Services, and we may combine and associate this information with information we (or our partners) may collect about the End User’s interactions with other ads served through our Platform.

The information we collect includes:

  * **Browser and Device information** , such as the device type and model, manufacturer, operating system type and version (e.g. iOS or Android), web browser type and version (e.g., Chrome or Safari), user-agent, carrier name, time zone, network connection type (e.g., Wi-Fi or cellular), IP address, general location inferred from IP address, information about our Publisher Client’s apps and versions currently active on a device (but not any other apps), and identifiers assigned to a device, such as its iOS Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), Android/Google Advertising ID (AAID or GAID), or other unique device identifier (typically an alphanumeric string allocated to a device by the device manufacturer, a Publisher Client’s Digital Property, or PubMatic, including identifiers stored in a cookie, ETag, or browser or web cache).
  * **Information about an End User’s behavior on our Publisher Clients’ Digital Properties** , such as information about the activities or actions on those Digital Properties, session start/stop time, and geolocation (including latitude and longitude co-ordinates, but only if the Publisher Client’s Digital Property (like an app) has enabled location services on the device and the End User has granted the Publisher Client permission to collect and share this information for advertising purposes).
  * **Information about ads served, viewed, or clicked on** , such as the type of ad, where the ad was served, whether the End User clicked on it, the number of times an End User has seen the ad, and whether the End User visited the Media Buyer’s website or relevant app store and/or purchased or installed the product or service advertised.



**Information we receive from third parties**

We may also combine, merge and/or enhance the information we collect about an End User with information collected from our Publisher Clients and third parties (like our data providers).  For example, our Publisher Clients may also collect information that they choose to pass to us either directly through our Ad Services or through application programming interfaces (APIs), when our Ad Services connect to their systems.

This information may include, for example: network type of an End User’s device, age, ethnicity (where permitted by law), gender, and precise geolocation (where permitted by law), mobile device IDs, demographic or interest data, obfuscated user identifiers such as hashed email addresses, and content viewed or actions taken on a website or app to help make the ads served to an End User more relevant while limiting exposure to less relevant ads.  Some Publisher Clients may provide precise geolocation information collected on certain of their Digital Properties.  We will not use precise geolocation information for interest-based advertising without your opt-in consent.

We (or our third-party partners) may also use this additional information to undertake “ID syncing” or “user matching,” which means that in addition to the PubMatic ID an End User has been assigned in our systems, we may also receive a list of unique IDs our external partners or Publisher Clients have assigned to the End User, which we match to the End User’s PubMatic ID.

**2.2       HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?**

We use the information we collect for a variety of business purposes.  For example, we use the information we collect for the following purposes:

  * **Serving Ads** : To allow Publisher Clients to offer advertising inventory in their Digital Properties and Media Buyers to bid on and fill that inventory with relevant ads.
  * **Ad Reporting and Conversions** : To provide information and reports to Media Buyers about when and how End Users have been exposed to their ads, clicked on their ads, or visited their Digital Property.
  * **Frequency Capping** : To prevent End Users from seeing the same ad too many times.
  * **Customizing Ads** : To infer End Users’ likely commercial interests ( _g_., sports or travel) based on their activities across websites, mobile apps, and other Digital Properties over time, including to build interest-based advertising segments or audiences, as well as to supplement the information we collect with additional information we receive from third parties, such as third-party advertising segments or audiences, to allow us to customize and more effectively tailor the ads we display to End Users and to optimize the display of ads (including limiting exposure to less relevant ads).
  * **Performance Analytics** : To analyze ad performance, such as tracking views of ads, as well as click-through rates to websites or app stores and/or installs of apps that have been advertised.
  * **Interest-Based Advertising** : To serve targeted ads to an End User on behalf of our Clients based on the End User’s activity across websites, mobile apps, and other Digital Properties over time and information regarding an End User’s inferred commercial interests.
  * **Location-Based Advertising** : To deliver location-based advertising, services, and content in real-time through the use of your device’s physical location (where permitted by law).
  * **Fraud Detection and Prevention and Security** : To identify invalid ad impressions, clicks, installs, or ad queries, protect us and our Publisher Clients from fraudulent behavior, and protect the security of the Ad Services.
  * **Providing, Managing, and Improving our Ad Services and Developing New Services** : To facilitate navigation, display information more effectively, and to personalize your experience while using the Ad Services, as well as auditing, researching, and analyzing information to provide, protect, manage, and improve our Ad Services, develop new services, and ensure that our technologies function properly.
  * **Service Usage and Support** : To calculate usage levels of the Ad Services, help diagnose server problems, and administer the Ad Services.
  * **A** **s we believe to be necessary or appropriate** : (a) under applicable law, including laws outside an End User’s country of residence; (b) to comply with subpoenas, warrants, or other legal process; (c) to respond to requests from public and government authorities including public and government authorities outside an End User’s country of residence; (d) to enforce our terms and conditions; (e) to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates; (f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of our affiliates, End Users, or others; and (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.



**2.3       COOKIES AND SIMILAR TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES**

We use cookies and other similar tracking technologies (such as pixel tags, IDFA, AAID/GAID, UDID, ETags, and web or browser caches) to collect information automatically from End Users’ devices.  They help us identify unique browsers or devices used by an End User and to perform functions like, for example, limiting the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed on our Publisher Clients’ Digital Properties, and serving an ad more relevant to the End User.  To opt out of our use of such technologies for interest-based advertising purposes, please follow the instructions for opting out, as described in “Your Opt-Out Choices” below.  See PubMatic’s [Platform Cookie and Other Similar Technologies Policy](https://pubmatic.com/legal/platform-cookie-policy/) for more information on how PubMatic uses cookies and other similar technologies.

**Cross-Device and Cross-App Targeting**

Our Publisher Clients and partners may use information that we share with them to establish connections among related devices (such as smartphones, tablets, and computers) for targeted advertising, analytics, and reporting purposes.  They may match an End User’s devices if the End User logs into the same online service on multiple devices or web browsers, or if the End User’s devices share similar attributes that support an inference that they are used by the same person or household.  This means that information about an End User’s use of websites or applications on his or her current browser or device may be combined and used with information from the End User’s other browsers or devices.  For example, this allows Media Buyers to deliver ads on an End User’s tablet based on activities the End User engaged in on his or her smartphone.  To opt out of cross-device targeting practices, please follow the instructions in the paragraph below titled “Opting Out of Cross-Device Targeting.”

Our Publisher Clients and partners also may use other information about an End User’s activity across multiple, unaffiliated third-party mobile applications for targeted advertising, analytics, and reporting purposes.  For example, if an End User uses a travel app, these third parties may display travel-related ads to the End User on other, unrelated apps.  To opt out of cross-app targeting practices, please follow the instructions in the paragraph below titled “Opting Out of Interest-Based Advertising for Mobile Advertising Identifiers.”

**SECTION 3 – PRIVACY FOR THE PUBMATIC PROPERTIES**

This Section describes how we collect and use information when visitors interact with or use any of the PubMatic Properties (such as our Websites).

**3.1       WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?**

**Information that individuals provide voluntarily**

Certain parts of the PubMatic Properties may ask visitors to provide personal information voluntarily: for example, we may collect personal information when a visitor registers for a PubMatic account, expresses an interest in obtaining additional information about PubMatic or our products and services, subscribes to our marketing, or otherwise contacts us.

The personal information we collect may include contact information (such as name, address, telephone number, or email address) and contact preferences.  It may also include professional information, such as job title, department or job role, and the nature of an individual’s request or communication.  We also collect information that visitors choose to provide to us when completing any ‘free text’ boxes in our forms (for example, for event sign-up, product feedback, or survey requests).  Please do not post any information that you do not want to reveal to the public at large.

**Information we or our third-party partners collect automatically**

When using the PubMatic Properties, we or our third-party partners may automatically collect certain information from an individual’s device.  In some countries, including countries in the EU, this information may be considered personal data under applicable data protection laws.

Specifically, the information we collect automatically may include IP address, operating system type and version, browser type and version, cookie ID, an individual’s activities on the PubMatic Properties, and other information about the individual’s system and connection and how the individual interacts with the PubMatic Properties and other websites.  We and our third-party partners may collect this information as a part of log files and through the use of cookies or other tracking technologies, as explained further under the heading “Cookies and Similar Tracking Technology“.

Some of our Publisher Clients have their own opt-out mechanisms that are linked from their sites or their online-posted privacy policies.  You should review the privacy policies of those companies for these opt-out links if you no longer wish to receive targeted advertising from a particular company, or multiple companies.

At this time, we do not honor “Do Not Track” headers and similar mechanisms.

**Opting Out of Interest-Based Advertising in Mobile Applications**

Our clients and partners may display interest-based advertising to you in mobile applications, based on your use of mobile applications over time and across non-affiliated apps.  To learn more about these practices and how to opt out, please visit [_http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices_](http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices), download the DAA’s AppChoices mobile app, and follow the instructions provided in the AppChoices mobile app.  You can also adjust the advertising preferences on your mobile device (in iOS, visit Settings > Privacy > Advertising > Limit Ad Tracking, and in Android, visit Settings > Google > Ads > Opt out of interest-based ads).

You have the following data protection rights:

  * You have the right to request **access to** or that we **change, update, or delete your personal information** at any time. Please note that we may impose a small fee for access and disclosure of your personal information where permitted under applicable law, which will be communicated to you.
  * If we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can **withdraw your consent** at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

  * If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), you also have the following rights:

Please note that because most of the information we store can only identify a particular browser or device, and cannot directly identify you personally, you may need to provide us with some additional information to enable us to identify the personal information we hold about you and ensure that we accurately fulfil your request and do not infringe on the privacy rights of other individuals.

You can exercise your rights at any time by contacting us at [privacy@pubmatic.com](mailto:privacy@pubmatic.com). Please review our [Data Subject Rights Notice](https://pubmatic.com/legal/eea-data-subject-rights-notice/) for further information and instructions on how to exercise your rights.

**4.4        LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL INFORMATION (EEA END USERS AND VISITORS ONLY) **

If you are a resident of the EEA, our legal basis for collecting and using personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.  However, we normally rely on our legitimate interests to collect personal information from you, except where such interests are overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.  Where we rely on our legitimate interests to process your personal information, they include the interests described in the sections above with the heading “How Do We Use Your Information” for our Ad Services and for the PubMatic Properties.

In some cases, we may rely on your consent or have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.  If we rely on consent to collect and/or process your personal information, we will obtain such consent in compliance with applicable laws.

If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “Contacting Us” heading below.

**4.5        THIRD PARTIES **

This Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information, or other practices of any third parties, including our vendors or any other third party operating any site or service to which the Ad Services or PubMatic Properties link.  The inclusion of a link through the Ad Services or Online Property does not imply endorsement of the linked site or service by us or by our affiliates.

Please note that we are not responsible for the collection, usage and disclosure policies and practices (including the data security practices) of other organizations, such as Facebook, Apple, Google, Microsoft, RIM or any other app developer, app provider, social media platform provider, operating system provider, wireless service provider or device manufacturer, including any personal information you disclose to other organizations through or in connection with the Ad Services or PubMatic Properties.

You should always read the privacy policy of any website you access or social network page through which you share information carefully in order to understand their specific privacy and information usage practices.

**4.6      HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION SECURE? **

We use reasonable organizational, technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to protect the personal information we collect and process.  The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information and to help ensure that your data is safe and secure.  However, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us in accordance with the “Contacting Us” section below.

**4.7       RETENTION OF YOUR INFORMATION**

We will retain personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy and where we have ongoing legitimate business needs to do so (for example, to provide the Ad Services, to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements, to enforce our agreements or comply with our legal obligations) unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

If you are an End User, we may retain information that we collect through the Ad Services (including the segment information that we receive from third parties) for up to 45 days from the last date that we received any of the End User’s data.  We may retain ad impression information for up to 45 days.  We may retain raw ad server logs for our mobile ad server business for up to 45 days.  We use precise geolocation for the specific ad impression to which the geolocation relates, after which the geolocation information is aggregated with other geolocation data for use by us for analytical purposes.  If we de-identify information we collect through the Ad Services, we may retain that information, in an aggregated format, indefinitely.  In such cases, we commit to not re-identifying the information.  If we are required to retain information to comply with a legal or audit obligation, we may store End User information for longer periods.

**4.8        INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS **

However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Policy.  These include:

  * Self-certifying to the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks. See our Privacy Shield Notice below for further information.
