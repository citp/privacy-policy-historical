We are concerned about privacy issues and want you to be familiar with how we collect, use and share information we receive about our clients and users and the options available to you. If you have any questions, you may contact us (see the "Contacting Us" section below.) 

PubMatic, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including, as of the date of this Privacy Policy, PubMatic Limited, PubMatic GmbH, PubMatic India Private Limited, パブマティック株式会社 (PubMatic KK), PubMatic Pte. Ltd., PUBM Serviços de Publicidade Digital Ltda and 据翼软件科技有限公司 ("we," "our," "PubMatic") offer marketing automation for publishers via a strategic selling platform, which enables publishers to optimize their digital assets while protecting their brands. Our platform is designed to help our publisher clients increase the amount of revenue they make from advertising sales by increasing the overall competition among media buyers for each advertising impression displayed through the PubMatic platform. We are a publisher-focused company, but at the same time we maintain client relationships with media buyers. As a user you may encounter an ad from one of our media buyer clients by viewing the content on a website or application owned or operated by one of our publisher clients. 

**SCOPE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY**

This Privacy Policy covers the information that we may collect or receive across the Internet and other digital formats: 

  1. from users who (i) visit www.pubmatic.com and other websites operated by us, including PubMatic’s client interfaces (the "Websites"), (ii) use our software applications (the "Apps"), (iii) use our social media pages (collectively, our "Social Media Pages"), and (iv) receive email messages that we send to you (collectively, the Websites, Apps and Social Media Pages, the "PubMatic Pages"); and
  2. through our technologies used by our publisher clients, media buyer clients and third parties that we use to gather and process information on their behalf (collectively, including the Websites, the Apps and our Social Media Pages, the "Services"). In this second context, we act as processors for the clients who serve as the data controllers for the information that we obtain from them. 



This Privacy Policy does not cover our privacy practices related to information submitted to the Careers section of the Websites. If you submit information to PubMatic’s Careers section of the Websites, please refer to PubMatic’s [Careers Privacy Policy](http://www.pubmatic.com/privacy-policy-careers.php).

"Other Information" is any information that is linked or reasonably linkable to a particular computer or device, but does not reveal your specific identity or directly identify an individual, such as: browser and device information; time spent on the Services, pages visited, language preferences, date and time an ad was served, clicks on ads, and other anonymous traffic data; your precise location; unique identifier, including mobile device identifier or statistical identifier; demographic information, including physical information; information provided by you; and aggregated information.

Our publisher clients may also collect information about you that they choose to pass to us either directly through our Services or through application programming interfaces or APIs, when our services connect to their systems. APIs are a particular set of rules and specifications that allow one software program to access and make use of another software program. The information our publisher clients may share includes network type of a user's device, year of birth, ethnicity (where permitted by law), gender, and precise geolocation (where permitted by law). Some publisher clients may provide precise geolocation information collected on certain platforms. We will not use precise geolocation information for Interest-Based Advertising without your opt-in consent.

  * to track delivery of an ad impression, 
  * to track your use of the Services to improve the design and functionality of the Services, 
  * to supplement Other Information with additional information we receive from third parties such as advertising segments to allow us to target ads to you that may be of interest to you,

We may partner with certain third parties to collect Other Information to engage in analysis, auditing, research, and reporting, as well as to deliver advertising that we believe may interest you based on your activity on our website and other websites over time. These third parties may set and access cookies on your computer or other device and may also use web logs or web beacons.

We will not collect or use sensitive data, such as Social Security Numbers or Government identifiers, insurance plan numbers, financial account numbers; information about past, present, or potential future health or medical conditions or treatments, including genetic, genomic, and family medical history; and sexual orientation unless we have obtained your prior consent. 

We may receive the following non-sensitive health-related advertising segments that we use to target ads to you that may be of interest to you: diet and fitness; doctors; health care professionals; health conscious; health and medicine; health and well-being; interest in health insurance; and pregnancy. 

**Disclosure of Other Information**

We may disclose Other Information: 

  * among our affiliates (identified in the second paragraph of this Privacy Policy) for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, 
  * to our client publishers to allow them to analyze the effectiveness and performance of our services and to offer targeted ad inventory to our media buyer clients, 
  * to our media buyer clients to allow them to make decisions regarding buying advertising inventory on our publisher clients' websites, other websites, and applications, and to analyze the effectiveness and performance of their advertising campaigns via our services, including sharing your device’s physical information to enable our media buyer clients to provide you with more personalized content and to study the effectiveness of advertising campaigns,

In some instances, we may combine Other Information with Personally Identifiable Information (such as combining your name with your geographical location). If we combine any Other Information with Personally Identifiable Information, the combined information will be treated by us as Personally Identifiable Information as long as it is combined. We will not use PII merged with previously-collected Other Information for Interest-based advertising purposes without your opt-in consent. 

**Retention of Other Information**

We retain Other Information we collect for purposes of serving targeted advertisements to you (including the segment information that we receive from third parties) for up to 90 days, unless we have not received any segment data for a user for 30 days, in which case the data for that user is no longer retained at that point in time. We retain impression information for up to six months. We retain raw ad server logs for our mobile ad server business for up to 9 months. We use precise geolocation for the specific ad impression to which the geolocation relates, after which the geolocation information is aggregated with other geolocation data for use by us for analytical purposes. If we de-identify Other Information we collect in connection with targeted advertising purposes, we may retain that information, in an aggregated format, indefinitely. In such cases, we commit to not re-identifying the information.
