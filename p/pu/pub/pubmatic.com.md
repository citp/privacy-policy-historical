# Privacy Policy | PubMatic

Last Updated: September 29, 2016; Effective: October 31, 2016.

We are concerned about privacy issues and want you to be familiar with how we collect, use and share information we receive about our clients and users and the options available to you. If you have any questions, you may contact us (see the “Contacting Us” section below.)

PubMatic, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including, as of the date of this Privacy Policy, PubMatic Limited, PubMatic GmbH, PubMatic India Private Limited, パブマティック株式会社 (PubMatic KK), PubMatic Pte. Ltd., PUBM Serviços de Publicidade Digital Ltda and 据翼软件科技有限公司 (PubMatic Sofware (Shanghai) Limited) (“we,” “our,” “PubMatic”), offer marketing automation for publishers via a strategic selling platform, which enables publishers to optimize their digital assets while protecting their brands. Our platform is designed to help our publisher clients increase the amount of revenue they make from advertising sales by increasing the overall competition among media buyers for each advertising impression displayed through the PubMatic platform. We are a publisher-focused company, but at the same time we maintain client relationships with media buyers. As a user you may encounter an ad from one of our media buyer clients by viewing the content on a website or application owned or operated by one of our publisher clients.

#### **SCOPE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY**

This Privacy Policy covers the information that we may collect or receive across the Internet and other digital formats:

  1. from users who (i) visit www.pubmatic.com and other websites operated by us, including PubMatic’s client interfaces (the “Websites”), (ii) use our software applications (the “Apps”), (iii) use our social media pages (our “Social Media Pages”), and (iv) receive email messages that we send to you (collectively, including the Websites, Apps and Social Media Pages, the “PubMatic Pages”); and
  2. through our technologies used by our publisher clients, media buyer clients and third parties that we use to gather and process information on their behalf (collectively, including the Websites, the Apps and our Social Media Pages, the “Services”). In this second context, we act as processors for the clients who serve as the data controllers for the information that we obtain from them.



This Privacy Policy does not cover our privacy practices related to information submitted to the Careers section of the Websites. If you submit information to PubMatic’s Careers section of the Websites, please refer to PubMatic’s [Careers Privacy Policy](http://pubmatic.com/legal/careers-privacy-policy/).

We may change this policy from time to time. Please consult the Privacy Policy regularly for updates. See “Updates to This Privacy Policy,” below, for more information.

We will retain your Personally Identifiable Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

#### **OTHER INFORMATION**

#### **Collection of Other Information**

“Other Information” is any information that is linked or reasonably linkable to a particular computer or device, but does not reveal your specific identity or directly identify an individual, such as: browser and device information; IP address; time spent on the Services, pages visited, language preferences, date and time an ad was served, clicks on ads, and other anonymous traffic data; your precise location; general location inferred from IP address; unique identifier, including mobile advertising identifier such as Apple IDFA or Google Advertising ID or statistical identifier; obfuscated user identifiers such as hashed email addresses; operating system type and version; information about mobile apps used; information about applications installed on a device; demographic information; and aggregated information.

We and our third-party service providers may collect Other Information in a variety of ways, including through: your browser or device; your mobile advertising identifier, such as Apple IDFA and Google Advertising ID; the use of statistical identifiers (which collect and use certain characteristics of your device to help us identify it over time); your use of the Apps; the use of pixel tags and other similar technologies; your IP address; the aggregation of information; ETags and web cache; and cookies (cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer that you are using).

Our publisher clients may also collect information about you that they choose to pass to us either directly through our Services or through application programming interfaces or APIs, when our services connect to their systems. APIs are a particular set of rules and specifications that allow one software program to access and make use of another software program. The information our publisher clients may share includes network type of a user’s device, age, ethnicity (where permitted by law), gender, and precise geolocation (where permitted by law). Some publisher clients may provide precise geolocation information collected on certain platforms. We will not use precise geolocation information for interest-based advertising without your opt-in consent.

#### **Use of Other Information**

We may use Other Information from the Services:

  * to operate, improve, analyze and manage the Services;
  * to ensure the Services function properly;
  * for advertising purposes, such as using an identifier for interest-based advertising and ad delivery and reporting across websites, online services, and apps over time, including optimization of location of ad placement, ad performance, reach and frequency metrics, fraud prevention, billing, logging the number and type of ads served on a particular day on a device;
  * to track the actions of users of the Services, measure and report on the success of marketing campaigns via pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear GIFs);
  * to identify and probabilistically recognize the same device at a later point in time for purposes of sending advertising or content to that device in mobile apps (using statistical identifiers);
  * to calculate usage levels of the Services, helping diagnose server problems and administer the Services via your IP Address (a number automatically assigned to the computer or device that you are using by your Internet Service Provider);
  * to provide you with personalized location-based advertising, services, and content through the use of your device’s physical location (where permitted by law);
  * to track delivery of an ad impression;
  * to track your use of the Services to improve the design and functionality of the Services;
  * to supplement Other Information with additional information we receive from third parties, such as advertising segments to allow us to target ads to you that may be of interest to you;
  * for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, display information more effectively, and to personalize your experience while using the Services; and
  * as we believe to be necessary or appropriate: (a) under applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to requests from public and government authorities including public and government authorities outside your country of residence; (d) to enforce our terms and conditions; (e) to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates; (f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of our affiliates, you or others; and (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.



We may partner with certain third parties to collect Other Information on the PubMatic Pages to engage in analysis, auditing, research, and reporting, as well as to deliver advertising that we believe may interest you based on your activity on our website and other websites over time. These third parties may set and access cookies on your computer or other device and may also use web logs or web beacons. For more information about these practices and how to opt out, please see PubMatic’s  [Website Cookie Policy](http://pubmatic.com/legal/website-cookie-policy/).

At this time, we do not honor “Do Not Track” headers and similar mechanisms.

We will not use data we collect for the purpose of determining employment eligibility, credit eligibility, health care eligibility, or insurance eligibility and underwriting and pricing.

We will not collect or use sensitive data, such as Social Security Numbers or Government identifiers, insurance plan numbers, financial account numbers; information about past, present, or potential future health or medical conditions or treatments, including genetic, genomic, and family medical history; and sexual orientation unless we have obtained your prior consent.

We may receive the following non-sensitive health-related advertising segments that we use to target ads to you that may be of interest to you: diet and fitness; doctors; health care professionals; health conscious; health and medicine; health and well-being; interest in health insurance; and pregnancy.

#### **Cross-Device and Cross-App Targeting**

Our clients and partners may use Other Information that we share with them to establish connections among related devices (such as smartphones, tablets, and computers) for targeted advertising, analytics, and reporting purposes. They may match your devices if you log into the same online service on multiple devices or web browsers, or if your devices share similar attributes that support an inference that they are used by the same person or household. This means that information about your use of websites or applications on your current browser or device may be combined and used with information from your other browsers or devices. For example, this allows advertisers to deliver ads to you on your tablet based on activities you engaged in on your smartphone. To opt out of cross-device targeting practices, please follow the instructions in the section below titled “Opting Out of Cross-Device Targeting.”

Our clients and partners also may use Other Information about your activity across multiple, unaffiliated third-party mobile applications for targeted advertising, analytics, and reporting purposes. For example, if you use a travel app, these third parties may display travel-related ads to you on another, unrelated app. To opt out of cross-app targeting practices, please follow the instructions in the section below titled “Opting Out of Interest-Based Advertising for Mobile Advertising Identifiers.” 

#### **Disclosure of Other Information**

We may disclose Other Information:

  * among our affiliates (identified in the second paragraph of this Privacy Policy) for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy;
  * to our client publishers to allow them to analyze the effectiveness and performance of our services and to offer targeted ad inventory to our media buyer clients;
  * to our media buyer clients to allow them to make decisions regarding buying advertising inventory on our publisher clients’ websites, other websites, and applications, and to analyze the effectiveness and performance of their advertising campaigns via our services, including sharing your device’s physical location to enable our media buyer clients to provide you with more personalized content and to study the effectiveness of advertising campaigns;
  * to our third-party service providers who provide services that enhance our services; and
  * as we believe to be necessary or appropriate: (a) under applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to requests from public and government authorities including public and government authorities outside your country of residence; (d) to enforce our terms and conditions; (e) to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates; (f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of our affiliates, you or others; and (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.



In some instances, we may combine Other Information with Personally Identifiable Information (such as combining your name with your geographical location). If we combine any Other Information with Personally Identifiable Information, the combined information will be treated by us as Personally Identifiable Information as long as it is combined. We will not use PII merged with previously-collected Other Information for Interest-based advertising purposes without your opt-in consent.

#### **Retention of Other Information**

We retain Other Information that we collect for purposes of serving targeted advertisements to you (including the segment information that we receive from third parties) for up to 90 days from the last date that we received any of your user data. We retain impression information for up to six months. We retain raw ad server logs for our mobile ad server business for up to 9 months. We use precise geolocation for the specific ad impression to which the geolocation relates, after which the geolocation information is aggregated with other geolocation data for use by us for analytical purposes. If we de-identify Other Information we collect in connection with targeted advertising purposes, we may retain that information, in an aggregated format, indefinitely. In such cases, we commit to not re-identifying the information.

#### **CHOICES AND ACCESS**
