# PubMatic - Privacy Policy

LAST UPDATED: JUNE 19, 2014

PubMatic, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including, as of the date of this Privacy Policy, PubMatic Limited, PubMatic GmbH, PubMatic India Private Limited, PubMatic KK and PubMatic Pte. Ltd. (" **we** ," " **our** ," " **PubMatic** ") offer a strategic selling platform to premium publishers, which enables them to optimize their digital assets while protecting their brands. PubMatic's platform is designed to help publishers increase the amount of revenue they make from advertising sales by increasing the overall competition among media buyers for each advertising impression displayed through the PubMatic platform. We are a publisher-focused company, but at the same time we maintain client relationships with media buyers. Ads that you see come from those media buyers, and usually the ad comes from an ad server with the same domain as the media buyer. Generally, a user will encounter an ad from one of our media buyers by viewing the content on a website or application owned or operated by one of our publishers.

We are concerned about privacy issues and want you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information. This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information that we collect through www.pubmatic.com and the other websites operated by us from which you are accessing this Privacy Policy (the " **Websites** "), through the software applications made available by us for use on or through computers and mobile devices (the " **Apps** "), through our social media pages and apps (collectively, our " **Social Media Pages** ") as well as through HTML formatted email messages that we send to you that link to this Privacy Policy and through our technologies used by our publishers, media buyers and third parties that we use to gather and process information on their behalf (collectively, including the Websites, the Apps and our Social Media Pages, the " **Services** "). By providing Personal Information to us, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.

We and our service providers may use Other Information to extract further related parameters, for example, we may extract information including but not limited to city, state, country and zip code and Designated Market Area ("DMA") from your IP address.

**How We May Collect Other Information**

We and our third party service providers may collect Other Information in a variety of ways, including:

  * **Through your browser or device** : Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language, Internet browser type and version and the name and version of the Services (such as the App) you are using. We use this information to ensure that the Services function properly.
  * **Mobile device identifier** : If the Website and / or Services are being used on a mobile device, we may also collect and use the device's unique device identifier or a unique identifier that we assign to the device. We use the identifier for purposes of cross-app advertising (as described below), as well as to deliver ads and provide advertising related services, such as providing a specific advertisement based on a particular time of day, statistical reporting in connection with the activity in an application, analytics and analysis, optimization of location of ad placement, ad performance, reach and frequency metrics (e.g., frequency capping), security and fraud prevention, billing, and logging the number and type of ads served on a particular day to a particular application or device. In addition, we may collect and analyze certain characteristics of an individual device and browser combination, in order to identify and probabilistically recognize the same device at a later point in time.
  * **Through your use of the App** : When you download and use the App, we and our service providers may track and collect App usage data, such as the date and time the App on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the App based on your device number.

Ad tags are pieces of code that allow the delivery of advertisements in the dedicated ad spaces on digital assets such as websites and applications. PubMatic's Ad Tags may transmit certain anonymous information about the web site, section of the site and size of the ad that we are optimizing. 
  * **IP Address** : Your " **IP Address** " is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). An IP Address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user accesses the Services, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited. Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other services. We use and disclose IP Addresses for purposes such as calculating usage levels of the Services, helping diagnose server problems, and administering the Services.
  * **Physical Location** : We may collect the physical location of your device by, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower or WiFi signals or by receiving such information directly from our publishers. We may use your device's physical location to provide you with personalized location-based services and content. We may also share your device's physical location, combined with information about what advertisements you viewed and other information we collect, with our marketing partners and media buyers to enable them to provide you with more personalized content and to study the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. In some instances, you may be permitted to allow or deny such uses and/or sharing of your device's location, but if you choose to deny such uses and/or sharing, we and/or our marketing partners and media buyers may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized services and content.
  * **From you** : Information such as your location, as well as other information, such as your preferred means of communication, is collected when you voluntarily provide this information. Unless combined with Personal Information, this information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Services.

We will not collect or use sensitive information unless we have obtained your prior consent. Sensitive information includes information we know to be related to medical information, but we may target ads based on expressed interest in particular health-related consumer products. For example, our publisher partners could retarget website visitors who showed interest in health and beauty products (makeup, skincare, hair care, lotions, perfumes, etc.), items related to personal fitness, and dietary supplements. The health-related advertising segments that we use are: diet and fitness; doctors; health care professionals; health conscious; health and medicine; health and well-being; interest in health insurance; and pregnancy.

**Other Information Collected by Third Parties**

Our clients (i.e. publishers) also collect information about you. They may choose to pass this information to us either directly through our Services or through application programming interfaces or APIs, when our services connect to their systems. APIs are a particular set of rules and specifications that allows one software program to access and make use of another software program. It helps facilitate the interaction between applications, similar to the way the user interface facilitates interaction between humans and computers. PubMatic uses APIs for its real-time bidding service, and occasionally uses publisher APIs to download data about users that is unique to those publishers.

The information our clients may share includes (but is not necessarily limited to) network type of a user's device, year of birth, ethnicity, gender, and precise geolocation. Some publishers may provide precise geolocation information collected on certain platforms. 

Several of our media buyers also use Other Information. All media buyers may use their own data providers. In addition, media buyers' ads may link to landing pages that have their own data collection processes.

This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information or other practices of any third parties, including our vendors or any other third party operating any site or service to which the Services link. The inclusion of a link on the Services does not imply endorsement of the linked site or service by us or by our affiliates.

Please note that we are not responsible for the collection, usage and disclosure policies and practices (including the data security practices) of other organizations, such as Facebook, Apple, Google, Microsoft, RIM or any other app developer, app provider, social media platform provider, operating system provider, wireless service provider or device manufacturer, including any Personal Information you disclose to other organizations through or in connection with the Apps or our Social Media Pages.

You should always read the privacy policy of any website you access or social network page through which you share information carefully in order to understand their specific privacy and information usage practices.

**How We May Use and Disclose Other Information**

Please note that we may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. If we are required to treat Other Information as Personal Information under applicable law, then we may use it as described in "How We May Collect Other Information" section above, as well as for all the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information.

We may disclose other information to publishers to allow them to analyze the effectiveness and performance of our service and to offer targeted ad incentory to our media buyers, and to media buyers to allow them to make decisions regarding buying advertising inventory on our publishers' websites and other websites and to analyze the effectiveness and performance of their advertising campaigns via our services.

In some instances, we may combine Other Information with Personal Information (such as combining your name with your geographical location). If we combine any Other Information with Personal Information, the combined information will be treated by us as Personal Information as long as it is combined.

SECURITY

We seek to use reasonable organizational, technical and administrative measures to protect Personal Information within our organization. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us in accordance with the "Contacting Us" section below.
