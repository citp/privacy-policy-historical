Information We Collect

PubMatic collects both personally identifiable information as well as non-personally identifiable information.

**Personally Identifiable Information**

Personally identifiable information is any information that identifies a specific individual, such as a name, email address, or phone number.

PubMatic only collects personally identifiable information if that information is voluntarily provided by the user. This may happen in several ways:

  * Message Board. A user may submit personally identifiable information in the process of registering or posting a message on the PubMatic message boards.
  * Subscription. A user may subscribe to periodic updates from PubMatic and provide an email address and/or name.
  * IP Address Logging. PubMatic collects user’s IP addresses in its log files. Your IP address may be logged and recorded.



**Non-Personally Identifiable Information**

Non-personally identifiable information is any information about the user that does not uniquely identify the individual.

PubMatic collects non-personally identifiable information in several ways:

  * Log files. A user’s activities on the PubMatic web site are logged. Clickstream information about the user is captured.
  * Cookies. A cookie may be stored on the user’s computer to indicate activity during a user’s session as well as activity across sessions.
  * Clear Pixels. Clear pixels (also called beacons) may be used to track the activity and flow of a user on the PubMatic web site.

PubMatic uses the personally identifiable information you share with us to respond to your query, comment, or request for a subscription. Personally identifiable information you share with us for the purpose of Message Board use is used to manage your account and to uniquely identify your posts for other users of the Message Boards.

PubMatic uses the non-personally identifiable information to track the performance of the PubMatic web site, analyze the performance, and improve it for your benefit.

All information may be used for additional purposes, such as auditing, research, and development of additional web site capabilities or services.

**Information Sharing**

PubMatic does not rent, share, or sell the personally identifiable information you share with us without your prior permission.

Non-personally identifiable information may be shared with 3rd party providers, in aggregated or unaggregated fashion.

Please note that we may also share information in the event that we are asked to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims, or as otherwise permitted by law.

If and when we use third parties to assist us in processing your personal information, we require that they comply with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

PubMatic may transfer the information it collects to any successor in interest to PubMatic (such as a company that acquires PubMatic), or internally to one or more affiliates (such as a corporate subsidiary or parent).
