<b>1. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY </b>

If PublicInfo.Directory obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 13, PublicInfo.Directory will immediately delete such information from its database. Because PublicInfo.Directory does not collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13, PublicInfo.Directory has no such information to use or disclose to third parties. PublicInfo.Directory has designed this Privacy Policy in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").
<b>2. INFORMATION COLLECTION PRACTICES </b>
(a) Traffic Data.
Like most website and mobile application operators, PublicInfo.Directory automatically gathers information of the sort that browsers automatically make available, including: (i) IP addresses; (ii) domain servers; (iii) types of computers accessing the Service; and (iv) types of Web browsers accessing the Service (collectively "Traffic Data"). Traffic Data is anonymous information that does not personally identify You.
(b) Cookie Policy - Tracking Over Time and Across Different Websites
"Cookies" are text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit or certain emails that you open. A Cookie acts as a string of information stored on a user's computer or mobile device, and that the user's browser provides to the Service each time the user submits a query to the Service. The purpose of a Cookie is to identify the user as a unique user of the Service.
PublicInfo.Directory uses two types of Cookies - "first-party cookies" and "third-party cookies."
First Party Cookies
PublicInfo.Directory uses first-party cookies on the Service, for example the Google Analytics Cookie, for the following purposes:
<ul><li>to gather visitor and access information relevant to customizing the Service to your interests; and
</li><li> to store your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you use the Service.
</li><ul>
IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO HAVE FIRST-PARTY COOKIES PLACED ON YOUR COMPUTER OR MOBILE DEVICE, YOU SHOULD SET YOUR BROWSERS TO REFUSE COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THE SERVICE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE SERVICE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF COOKIES. IF YOU REFUSE COOKIES, YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY.
Third Party Cookies
In addition to these purposes, Google, Inc. ("Google") uses third-party cookies to serve online interest-based advertisements on PublicInfo.Directory. As an important example, Google uses of a cookie known as "DoubleClick" to enable both Google and Google's third party marketing partners to serve advertisements to You based on information gathered during Your use of the Service or Your visit to other websites and services.
PublicInfo.Directory may advertise on other third party websites to You after You access the Service. We and third party marketing partners, including without limitation Google, may use first party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) to inform, optimize, and serve advertisements to You based on your use of the Service.
Google allows users to customize cookie preferences in Google Ads Settings page. You can also learn more about how to delete or control cookies at www.aboutcookies.org.
(c) Ad Serving.
