# Privacy policy

Publy takes your privacy very seriously. This privacy policy governs and details the main privacy principles we apply to the data we collect through our services.

### 1 -About Publy’s services

Publy specializes in creating personalized advertisements. We work with online partners to build advertisements for users who visit their website or mobile applications and with publishers to display personalized advertisements.

Our aim is to deliver advertisements by displaying products and/or personalized banners that you might be interested in, based on your recent browsing behavior. For example, if you visit and browse on Website/mobile application A, on a subsequent online visit to Website/mobile application B, you will see ads personalized by your browsing history on Website/mobile application A.

With our service, you should receive personalized ads that are more relevant for you than the standard advertising you would receive without Publy. [Click here for more information on Interest Based Advertising](http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising).

In our adv tag could run some different ads from many agencies, for example:

**Google AdSense** : <http://www.google.com/intl/en/ads>  
**OpenX** : <http://openx.com/legal/openx-website-privacy-principles/>  
**Criteo** : <http://www.criteo.com/privacy/>  
**Rubicon Project** : <http://rubiconproject.com/privacy/>

### 2 – Our technology

Online web environment: _(desktop, tablet, and smartphone browsers)_  
Publy “tags” visitors to its partners’ websites with browser cookies. Users tagged by Publy are given a technical identifier. At no point does Publy collect identifying personal data such as your name or address.  
The browser cookies track the products viewed by the visitor and pages visited of the partner for whom Publy is delivering ads. Pixel tags are used by Publy to transfer browsing data from visitors of our partner’s websites to Publy’s servers.

**What are cookies?**  
A cookie is a small text file stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. There are two types of cookies:  
Session cookies are used to make it easier for you to navigate on websites. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser.  
Persistent cookies are used to run our technology as they enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our partners’ websites. Persistent cookies remain on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following the directions provided in your internet browser’s ‘help’ file.

**What are pixel tags?**  
A pixel tag _(also commonly known as a web beacon)_ is an industry-standard, often-transparent graphic image usually no larger than a 1×1 pixel that is placed in a website.  
Our partners’ advertisements are displayed on many websites, also known as “publishers.” These publishers may also place cookies on your browser. These cookies are there so that the publishers recognize that Publy has a personalized advertisement available for your browser.

**Browser matching:** _(desktop, tablet, and smartphone browsers)_  
To serve you our personalized advertisements and provide a harmonized web experience we may match your identifiers on the different browsers you are using. At no point we collect identifying personal data such as your name or address to operate the matching.

We use exact matching methods by leveraging our advertising partner’s identifiers or email hash that they may pass to us. See data collection paragraph to learn more. Matching your devices only works in the online environement _(browser to browser)_ ; mobile application environment remains separate.

**Other environments** _(Mobile applications)_  
In environments that do not support cookies, like mobile applications, we may use other similar technologies for the same purpose of cookies. To serve our ads in mobile applications we collect identifiers, such as Google Advertising ID or IDFA depending on the operating system of your mobile device. These identifiers consist in a string of technical and random characters singling out your device that Publy stored by Publy with a hash _(non reversible encrypting method)_.

### 3 – Data collection and use

We do not know who you are. We collect and use anonymous data relating to your browsing navigation to display personalized advertisements.  
We collect anonymous information  
We only collect data related to your browsing activity through cookies or equivalent identifiers that record:  
events related to your activity on the partner’s website _(such as the number of pages viewed, the products you viewed on that website, your searches made on the partner’s website)_ information related to your device _(device type, operating system, version)_ and events related to the Publy ad serving activity such as the number of ads displayed to you.  
We also collect technical user identifiers from our partners for the purpose of matching the browsers you use and serve you relevant ads based on your behaviour accross browsers.

**For that purpose we process and store**

  1. We do not collect any identifying information
  2. We do not know who you are.
  3. We do not know your address, your place of work, your date of birth, your email address, your phone number.
  4. We do not use or store your IP address for targeting purposes*.
  5. We do not collect hardware-based identifiers such as UDID, Mac Address.
  6. We do not collect sensitive information _(such as religion, political opinion, health…)_.
  7. We collect this information in order to increase the relevancy of the ads being displayed to you.
  8. The data we collect is also used for reporting purposes, and to give our clients and partners more information about the performance of their advertising campaigns, and to improve performance over time.
  9. We do not create segments to specifically target children under 13 years old.
  10. We do not process any information which could be used by Publy, directly or indirectly, with the help of a third party or otherwise, to determine the personal identity of users.
  11. We share information collected with our subsidiaries or affiliated companies. We share aggregated data with our partners, i.e. data that does not permit identification of a partner, or permit you to be identified. We share non-aggregated data only upon approval of our partners and in compliance with our commercial agreements.
  12. We partner with Ad exchanges platforms to buy ad placements through auctions. Before the auction we match our ID with the ad exchange platform and then participate to the auction by sending the bid price and the banner code to display.



*** In compliance with the best industry standards, we use IP addresses:**

    1. For fraud detection purposes _(and not for targeting purposes)_ to help alert us to situations which could not have been caused by human behavior, such as a massive amount of clicking in a limited period of time;
    2. To extract geographical information.
