**Information Collected and tracked by PubArticles**

We only collect person information that is relevant to the purpose of our Site, which is to enable users to access certain materials or pages (i.e. author signup and tell a friend etc.) and to register as a user on this Site, PubArticles requires that you provide certain personal information, including, but not limited to, your name, phone number and e-mail address. This information allows us to provide you with a customized and efficient experience. We use this information in order to contact you to provide you with further information about our company and services, as well as for other commercial and/or internal purposes such as market research in order to better understand the demographics of our Site visitors and potential customers and partners. We may share this information with our authorized partners and / or with third parties who act for or on behalf of us, but we do not otherwise provide or sell any information gathered on this Site to outside vendors. 

**We gather two types of information about users:**

1\. Information You Provide to Us:  
We receive and store any information you enter on our Site or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. 

1） Join (Registration): In order for you to use PubArticles services, such as submitting new articles, you must complete a registration form. As part of this registration form, we require select personal information (including your full name and e-mail address etc.).   
2） User Profile: In order for you to express yourself beyond just the information collected during registration, we enable you to provide additional information, such as a bio, business URLs, and like that. In addition, you may choose to include photos of yourself in your profile. As indicated below, you can control how your information is displayed and used. 


2\. Automatic Information:  
Information we gather through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our Site. This information allows us to better tailor our content to readers' needs. Under no circumstances do we divulge any information about an individual user to a third party. 

**Use of Information**

We use any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their experience in our network of Sites, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the Sites or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users. 

As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily provide in order to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to participate in polls, surveys, message boards, and forums. 

We use tracking information to determine which areas of our Sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. We track search terms entered in Search function as one of many measures of what interests our users. But we don't track which terms a particular user enters. 

We create aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs. Because we don't track the usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser or sponsor will never know that a specific user clicked their ad. 

**Cookies**

The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it will enable us to relate your use of this Site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided.

We use cookies to track user traffic patterns. In addition, you can delete any cookies that have already been placed on your computer.
