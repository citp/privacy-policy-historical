# Privacy Policy | PCG Public Partnerships

  
PCG Public Partnerships respects the privacy of your personal information. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information that PCG may collect from you at its web sites (each referred to as “the Site”), what we do with that information, and with whom we may share the information.

Each visitor to the Site (“the User”) is encouraged to review this Privacy Policy. By using the Site, the User is accepting the Privacy Policy. The Privacy Policy cannot be changed by the User. If the User does not agree to the Privacy Policy, then the User may not use the Site.

## Scope

The Privacy Policy applies to all PCG Public Partnerships corporate web sites that are generally accessible by the public. The Privacy Policy does not apply to password-protected web sites created by PCG Public Partnerships for specific PCG Public Partnerships clients, which by their nature require different uses of personal information.
