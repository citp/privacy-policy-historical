	  <li>Improve the products and services;</li>

    	  <li>Store your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit the Site;</li>
    	  <li>Provide you relevant advertising and content; and</li>
	  <li>Properly manage our Site.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Please note that some cookies may be placed by a third party service provider who performs some of these functions for us. Other companies use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies.</p>

For example, anonymous information collected across multiple sites that you visit over time may enable the ad network to predict your preferences and show you ads that are most likely to be of interest to you.</p>
