<h1>PublicRecords.com Privacy Policy</h1>

        <div id="formContainer" style="width:100%; float:left; padding:4px 0px 4px 4px; margin-bottom:10px;">
<h2>Effective January 2010, Revised October 2014</h2>
<p>PublicRecords.com respects your right to privacy and we are committed to protecting it. This statement discloses the information practices for the web pages associated with the domain www.PublicRecords.com (the "Website"), including what type of personal information we gather and track, how we use this personal information, and with whom we share the personal information.
</p>

<p>
We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully when using our web site or services, or transacting business with us. By using our web site, including, without limitation, signing up for offers and/or continuing to receive information from PublicRecords.com, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy, and you are acknowledging that we are not providing you with a consumer report, and are certifying that you will not use the information obtained from us for any purpose covered by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. §1681, et seq.).
</p>

<p>If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please refer to the end of this Privacy Policy for information on how to contact us.</p>

<h2>Personal Information</h2>
<p>In general, you can visit us on the Internet without telling us who you are and without giving any personal information about yourself. However, you may choose to give us personal information in a variety of situations. For example, you may want to give us information such as your name and address, phone number or e-mail address so we may correspond with you, process an order, or provide you with a subscription or service. You may give us your credit card details to buy a product or service from us, or provide us a description of your education and work experience in connection with a job opening at PublicRecords.com for which you wish to be considered. The purpose of this Policy is to inform you of how we will use your information, before you provide it. If you tell us that you do not want us to use this information in this manner or to make further contact with you beyond fulfilling your requests, we will respect your wishes. If you give us personal information about somebody else, such as a spouse or associate, we will assume that you have their permission to do so.
</p>

<h2>How to Remove your Information from the PublicRecords.com Public Records Databases</h2>
<p>Public records are available from the official public records custodian or repository to anyone who requests them. In order for any database of public records to be useful, the databases must contain all of the information in the public records offices. If you have a compelling privacy or security issue, you may wish to contact the official custodians of those public records that contain sensitive information about you, such as your county's land records office, to determine how to remove your information from the public record. (The process of having public records sealed typically requires a court order.)</p>
<p>This process will ensure that the information is not available to the public, to us, or to any other public records information provider.
In addition to public records, personal information may be publicly or commercially available. Publicly available information consists of online and offline information that is generally available but is not maintained by a government agency, such as names, addresses and telephone numbers of individuals and businesses, professional licensing and trade organization information, press releases and newspaper articles and content from blogs or social networking sites. Commercial records consist of information that is maintained by enterprises and is available for purchase, such as marketing and telemarketing lists, phone connect and disconnect information, and business profile data.</p>

<p>As a courtesy we allow you to opt out your personal information from our Website. What this means is that your name as it appears in a particular record and the associated identifying information such as your address and phone number will be suppressed if you request this in the manner described below. However, please note that any time your identifying information appears in a public record or in a publicly or commercially available manner, in a way that is different from the particular record you opted out, it will again appear on our Website. For example, if your address or area code changes, your new information -- including other associated identifying information -- will again appear unless you opt out the new record. Similarly, if the way in which your name or address appears in a record differs from a record you opted out (e.g., "James" instead of "Jim," or "1505 Third AVE NE" instead of "1505-3rd Avenue Northeast"), we may include the differing record. Please also note that there may be more than one record on our Website associated with your personal information. Opting out one particular record will not opt out other record(s).In addition to this Website, there are many other companies offering public records search services, and your request that we opt out your information from this Website will not prevent your information from appearing on these other services.</p>

<p>In order for us to suppress or opt out your personal information from appearing on our Website, we need to verify your identity. To do this, we require faxed or mailed proof of identity. Proof of identity can be a state issued ID card or driver's license. If you are uploading, faxing, or mailing a copy of your driver's license, we require that you cross out the photo and the driver's license number. We only need to see the name, address and date of birth. We will only use this information to process your opt out request. </p>

<p>To submit your opt out request, please submit via fax to 425-974-6194 or submit via mail please send to PublicRecords.com Attn: Removal, 4607 Lakeview Canyon Rd. Suite 127, Westlake Village, CA 91361. Allow 7-14 business days to process your request. We will only process opt out requests received by fax or mail and no request will be processed without complete information (i.e., name, address and date of birth). Requests for opt out will not be processed over the phone or via email.</p>

<h2>How we Use and Share Personal Information</h2>
<p>
The following paragraphs describe in more detail how we may use the personal information you provide to us and with whom we may share it.</p>
<h3>Fulfilling your Transaction Request</h3>
<p>
If you request something from this Website, for example, a product or service, a callback, or specific marketing materials, we will use the information you provide to fulfill your request. To help us do this, we will share information with service providers to help us bring you the products and services we offer, either directly as the provider of such product or service, or indirectly such as financial institutions for credit card processing, email service providers, outsourced customer service providers, survey providers, or postal service providers. These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We also require these third parties to maintain your personal information in the strictest confidence. In addition, we will give the information you provide to our advertisers from whom you have indicated you want to purchase a product or service.
</p>
<h3>Communications from Us</h3>
<p>
When you request something from this Website, we will send you transactional emails related to your service request. You cannot opt out of receiving these communications. However, you can opt in to receive promotional and newsletter emails from us.

</p>
<h3>Marketing Use</h3>
<p>
The information you provide to us on this Website will also be used, with your permission, by us and selected third parties for marketing purposes. Before we use it, we will offer you the opportunity to choose whether or not to have your information used for this purpose.

In addition, like many websites, we gather certain information automatically (including cookies and log files). This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and click stream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer this Website, to track users' movements around this Website and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
</p>
<h3>Third Party Monitoring</h3>
<p>
In addition, service providers and other third parties such as advertisers may also use information gathering technologies on this Website (including cookies and beacons) in connection with their services to collect anonymous information. Shared and/or collected information, as described above, is controlled by the relevant affiliated company or third party and is not controlled by us; specifically, (i) such information is governed by the privacy policy and terms of use of the relevant other party and (ii) we will in no way be responsible or liable to you for any data breach by such other party that compromises or otherwise affects your information.

</p>

<h2>Online Advertising</h2>
<p>
Certain companies help us deliver interactive on-line advertising. These companies collect and use information about customers to help us better understand the offers, promotions, and types of advertising that are most appealing to our customers. After the information is collected, it is aggregated so it is not identifiable to a specific individual.
</p>

If you use a blog or submit to a testimonial on our website, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.
</p>

<h2>Disclosures Required By Law</h2>
<p>
We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process served on our website.
</p>

<h2>Links to Non-PublicRecords.com Websites</h2>
<p>This website contains links to other third party websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those other websites.</p>

<h2>Access to your Account</h2>
<p>If you would like to update your personal information in your account such as your name, address or email address, you can do so by logging into your account and updating your personal information.
</p>

<h2>Information Security</h2>
<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
</p>
<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
</p>

</p>

<h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
<p>If we decide to change this Policy, we will post the changes to this Policy, the home page link, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
