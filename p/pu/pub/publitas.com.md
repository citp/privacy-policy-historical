# Privacy Statement

This privacy policy concerns the processing of personal data by the public websites publitas.com (“Publitas website”), app.publitas.com (“Publitas CMS”) and support.publitas.com (“Publitas support”) as well as the processing of personal data when communicating with us through email or phone.

Sections 1, 2 and 3 below provide an overview of the collection and use of personal data by Publitas and the purposes for which this data is being used. We always seek to find a balance between your fundamental right to privacy and the legitimate interests of Publitas, in compliance with European regulations.

## 1\. Your data in online publications

When you’re viewing our customers’ online publications, Publitas _does not collect or process any personal data_ , except for your IP address which is temporarily stored in our system for security purposes only.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to the processing of personal data about end users by our customers. We have no control over our customers’ information privacy practices. If you are viewing an online publication or third party website, you should refer to their privacy policy for information about how they process your personal data.

## 2\. Your data related to our websites, services and your account

### A. When browsing our websites

When you visit our websites, we automatically collect information about how you interact with our website for the sole purpose of analyzing anonymous website usage and identifying improvements. This information includes cookies, date and time of your visit, pages viewed and generic information about the technology used to access our site. We may also use your IP address to derive what country you’re currently in to show you the correct pricing information.

A third party provider called Intercom delivers our integrated chat solution on our website. Intercom sets cookies and tracks what page you’re on for the purpose of showing and hiding the chat window when relevant.

We engage third parties like social- and advertising platforms that set cookies and analyze your browsing behaviour in order to show ads to internet users with similar browsing behaviour. The information collected by these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g. by reference to your name or email address).

We may ask for your consent to use third parties like social- and advertising platforms that set cookies so we can show you relevant ads based on how you’ve browsed our website.

### B. When you fill out an online form, chat with us on our website or sign up for a trial

Contact data you provide through online forms on our website, the chat widget or the trial signup forms (including your email address) will be used to follow-up on your request and/or provide you access to your trial account. For this same purpose, we may keep records of our communication with you and track interactions with our email messages (such as opening). We may also use third parties like social- and advertising platforms that set cookies so we can show you relevant ads about your download or trial.

### C. When we contact you about our services

Our sales and marketing team may come across your details or your company’s details online in our search for companies we think we can add value to with our services. In doing so, we may store your name, business contact information (such as work email address), information about your position and information about your company in our systems. We will also keep records of our communication with you and track interactions with our email messages (such as opening). We do this so we can contact you about our services through email and/or phone and effectively follow-up on our communication with you.

When you create or activate your account, we will collect basic information about you in order to properly identify you and provide you access to our system.

Because over 50% of the company works location-independent, our interview process typically involves video calls which we may record in order to share them with team members or other people relevant to the position you’re applying for.

Any additional information you provide during the interview process will only be used for the purpose of serving the interview process and will never be shared outside of Publitas.
