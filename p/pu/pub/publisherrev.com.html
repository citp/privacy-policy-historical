<b>Incite Network LLC's PublisherRev.com Privacy Policy</b><br>
<br>
<br>
Last updated September 3, 2008.<br><br>
PLEASE NOTE: OUR PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES FROM TIME TO TIME AND CHANGES
ARE EFFECTIVE UPON POSTING. PLEASE CHECK BACK FREQUENTLY FOR UPDATES AS
IT IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO BE AWARE OF CHANGES. INCITE NETWORK LLC DOES
NOT PROVIDE NOTICES OF CHANGES IN ANY MANNER OTHER THAN BY POSTING THE
CHANGES AT THIS WEB SITE.
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY PLEASE DO NOT
PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION TO INCITE NETWORK LLC OR USE ANY OF THE SERVICES OR
PRODUCTS OFFERED OR PROVIDED ON ANY OF THE WEB SITES REFERRED TO IN
THIS PRIVACY POLICY.<br><br>
The information collection, use, and dissemination practices of Incite
Network LLC.
This policy applies to Incite Network LLC's collection, use, storage and
disclosure of information by Incite Network LLC on its (a) websites, including
all its divisions, subsidiaries and related companies (collectively,
the "Websites"), (b) on various third party websites, and (c) to Incite
Network LLC's other information collection, including the purchase of
customer lists from third parties. Incite Network LLC is not responsible for
the information collection or privacy practices of third web sites or
applications.<br>
<br>
1. Collection of Information.<br>
1.1 Survey Information.<br>
Incite Network LLC collects information from individuals by various methods,
including, but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes
an Incite Network LLC survey, order form, or a registration page either online
or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or
registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a
"Survey"). (As used herein, "online" means using the Internet,
including the Websites, and related technologies, and "offline" means
by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail,
using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the
Surveys, Incite Network LLC or a third party (a "Third Party") may ask an
individual to provide various information to Incite Network LLC, which may
include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code,
telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth
date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation,
social security number, employment information, personal and online
interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to
time (together, "Survey Information"). Incite Network LLC may also collect
information concerning an individual from another source and uses that
information in combination with information provided from this web
site. Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals
are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to Incite Network LLC or
Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from Incite Network LLC
or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to Incite Network LLC.<br>
<br>
1.2 Third Party List Information.<br>
Incite Network LLC collects information from individuals when an individual
provides information to a third party and Incite Network LLC subsequently
purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the
third party (the "Seller"). Such purchased information may include, but
is not limited to, an individual's name, email address, street address,
zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and
carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital
status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online
interests, and such other information as the individual may have
provided to the Seller (together, "Third Party List Information"). When
acquiring Third Party List Information, Incite Network LLC seeks assurances
from the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Third Party
List Information to Incite Network LLC and that the Seller has a right to
provide offers from advertisers to the individuals whose personal
information is included on the Seller's list.<br> <br>

1.3 Other Information.<br>
Other occasions when Incite Network LLC obtains information from individuals
include (1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking
to redeem an incentive offered by Incite Network LLC or by a third party, (2)
when an individual requests assistance through Incite Network LLC's customer
service department, and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes
to a Incite Network LLC service or newsletter (together, "Other Information").<br>
<br>
1.4 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.<br>
Incite Network LLC currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to
associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with
information about the individual in our database. Additionally, Incite Network LLC 
may use other new and evolving sources of information in the
future (together, "Technology Information").<br>
(a) Cookies.
A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the
individual's computer that allows Incite Network LLC to identify the
individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in Incite Network LLC's 
database. You may read more about cookies at
http://cookiecentral.com. Individuals who use the Websites need to
accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of
the Websites.<br>
(b) Web Beacons.
A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image
on a web page (by using an img src="x" programming function -- see
http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to
transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form
of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously
acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows
Incite Network LLC to track certain web sites an individual visits online. Web
beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be
interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing
purposes. For example, Incite Network LLC might place, with the consent of a
third party website, a web beacon on the third party's website where
fishing products are sold. When Joe, an individual listed in Incite
Network LLC's database, visits the fishing website, Incite Network LLC receives
notice by means of the web beacon that Joe visited the fishing site,
and Incite Network LLC would then update Joe's profile with the information
that Joe is interested in fishing. Incite Network LLC may thereafter present
offers of fishing related products and services to Joe. In addition to
using web beacons on web pages, Incite Network LLC also uses web beacons in
email messages sent to individuals listed in Incite Network LLC's database.<br>
(c) New Technology.<br>
The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web
beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is Incite Network LLC's use of new and
evolving technology. As a result, Incite Network LLC strongly encourages
individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of
technology.<br><br>

1.5 Outside Information.<br>
Incite Network LLC may receive information about individuals from third
parties or from other sources of information outside of Incite Network LLC
including information located in public databases ("Outside
Information").<br>
<br>
1.6 Individual Information.<br>
As used herein, Individual Information means Survey Information, Third
Party List Information, Other Information, Technology Information, and
Outside Information, and any other information Incite Network LLC gathers or
receives about individuals.<br>
<br>
1.7 No Information Collected from Children.<br>
Incite Network LLC will never knowingly collect any personal information about
children under the age of 13. If Incite Network LLC obtains actual knowledge
that it has collected personal information about a child under the age
of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database.
Because it does not collect such information, Incite Network LLC has no such
information to use or to disclose to third parties. Incite Network LLC has
designed this policy in order to comply with the Children's Online
Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").<br><br>

1.8 Credit Card Information.<br>
Incite Network LLC may in certain cases collect credit card numbers and
related information, such as the expiration date of the card ("Credit
Card Information") when an individual places an order from Incite Network LLC.
When the Credit Card Information is submitted to Incite Network LLC, such
information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software.
Incite Network LLC will use the Credit Card Information for purposes of
processing and completing the purchase transaction, and the Credit Card
Information will be disclosed to third parties only as necessary to
complete the purchase transaction.<br><br>

2. Use of Individual Information.<br>
2.1 Discretion to Use Information.<br>
<br>
The following paragraphs in Section 2 describe how Incite Network LLC
currently uses Individual Information, but Incite Network LLC may change or
broaden its use at any time. As noted below, Incite Network LLC may update
this policy from time to time. Incite Network LLC may use Individual
Information to provide promotional offers to individuals by means of
email advertising, telephone marketing, direct mail marketing, online
banner advertising, and package stuffers, among other possible uses.<br>
<br>
2.2 Email.
Incite Network LLC uses Individual Information to provide promotional offers
by email to individuals. Incite Network LLC may maintain separate email lists
for different purposes. If email recipients wish to end their email
subscription from a particular list, they need to follow the
instructions at the end of each email message to unsubscribe from the
particular list. To unsubscribe from all Incite Network LLC's email lists, a
person must send an email to support@publisherrev.com.<br>
2.2(a) Content of Email Messages.<br>
In certain commercial email messages sent by Incite Network LLC, an
advertiser's name will appear in the "From:" line but hitting the
"Reply" button will cause a reply email to be sent to Incite Network LLC. The
"Subject:" line of Incite Network LLC email messages will usually contain a
line provided from the advertiser to Incite Network LLC<br>
2.2(b) Solicited Email.<br>
Incite Network LLC only sends email to individuals who have agreed on the
Websites to receive email from Incite Network LLC or to individuals who have
agreed on third party websites to receive email from third parties such
as Incite Network LLC. Incite Network LLC does not send unsolicited email messages.
As a result, statutes requiring certain formatting for unsolicited
email are not applicable to Incite Network LLC's email messages.<br>

2.3 Targeted Advertising.<br>
Incite Network LLC uses Individual Information to target advertising to an
individual. When an individual is using the Internet, Incite Network LLC uses
Technology Information (see also Section 2.5 below) to associate an
individual with that person's Individual Information, and Incite Network LLC
attempts to show advertising for products and services in which the
person has expressed an interest in the Surveys, indicated an interest
by means of Technology Information, and otherwise. Incite Network LLC may, at
its discretion, target advertising by using email, direct mail,
telephones, cell phones, and other means of communication to provide
promotional offers.<br>
<br>
2.4 Direct Mail and Telemarketing.<br>
Incite Network LLC uses Individual Information to advertise, directly or
indirectly, to individuals using direct mail marketing or telemarketing
using telephones and cell phones.<br>

2.5 Use of Technology Information.<br>
Incite Network LLC uses Technology Information (1) to match a person's Survey
Information and Third Party List Information to other categories of
Individual Information to make and improve profiles of individuals, (2)
to track a person's online browsing habits on the Internet, (3) to
determine which areas of Incite Network LLC's web sites are most frequently
visited. This information helps Incite Network LLC to better understand the
online habits of individuals so that Incite Network LLC can target advertising
and promotions to them.<br>

2.6 Profiles of Individuals.<br>
Incite Network LLC uses Individual Information to make a profile of an
individual. A profile can be created by combining Survey Information
and Third Party List Information with other sources of Individual
Information such as information obtained from public databases.<br>
2.7 Storage of Individual Information.<br>
Incite Network LLC stores the Individual Information in a database on Incite Network LLC 
computers. Our computers have security measures (such as a
firewall) in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration
of the information under Incite Network LLC's control. Not withstanding such
measures, Incite Network LLC cannot guarantee that its security measures will
prevent Incite Network LLC computers from being illegally accessed, and the
Individual Information on them stolen or altered.<br>
<br>

Incite Network LLC WILL NOT SELL OR TRANSFER INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES FOR ANY PURPOSE.<br>

necessary to provide a product or service that a person orders from
such third party while using Incite Network LLC web sites or when responding

Incite Network LLC may disclose Individual Information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, and other legal processes.<br>

sub-groups of persons.<br>

3.5 Access.<br>
Individuals have access to their Individual Information collected to
provide an opportunity for an individual to correct, amend, or delete
such information. Access can be obtained by contacting
support@publisherrev.com. Incite Network LLC may also grant advertising clients
and email services providers' access to an individual's email address
to verify the origin of the Individual Information collected.<br>
<br>
4. Privacy Practices of Third Parties.<br>
4.1 Advertiser cookies and web beacons.<br>
Advertising agencies, advertising networks, and other companies
(together, "Advertisers") who place advertisements on the Websites and
on the Internet generally may use their own cookies, web beacons, and
other technology to collect information about individuals. Incite Network LLC
does not control Advertisers' use of such technology and Incite Network LLC
has no responsibility for the use of such technology to gather
information about individuals.<br>

4.2 Links.<br>
The Websites and email messages sometimes contain hypertext links to
the web sites of third parties. Incite Network LLC is not responsible for the
privacy practices or the content of such other web sites. Linked web
sites may contain links to web sites maintained by third parties. Such
links are provided for your convenience and reference only. Incite Network LLC
does not operate or control in any respect any information, software,
products or services available on such third party web sites. The
inclusion of a link to a web site does not imply any endorsement of the
services or the site, its contents, or its sponsoring organization.<br>
