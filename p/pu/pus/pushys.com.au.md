# Pushys Privacy Policy

Pushys is committed to acting in accordance with the Privacy Act 1993 by providing you with services in a way that does not affect your privacy.

Any information we collect from you will only be used for the purposes of conducting our business, supplying you with our products and services and keeping you informed about aspects of business that may be of interest to you.

From time to time Pushys may collect information from customers indirectly, for example by monitoring visitors to our website. When you visit our website, a ‘cookie’ may be placed on the hard drive of your computer. This allows us to track customer interest and usage patterns. The information we may collect and store may include the following:

  * the IP address for the computer you are using when connected to the internet and the domain name from which you are accessing the internet;
  * the operating system and the browser your computer uses and any search engine you are using;
  * the date and time you are visiting our website;
  * the URLS of the pages you visit; and
  * if you provide it, your email address.



We may keep track of the pages our customers visit within our website in order to monitor which information and services are most popular. This information is collected for website management and marketing purposes only. The information is collected in such a way so that the customer’s personal details are not able to be identified.

Pushys will not disclose, sell or lend your **personal information** to other companies or persons who are not part of our business group, unless we obtain your prior permission. Any information about our customer base that is disclosed to marketing partners without your prior consent will be of a generic nature, such as overall customer demographics, trends, interests and buying patterns. Such information may be shared with existing or potential marketing partners, in order to enable Pushys to extend the services and products we make available to you.

Pushys uses a **secure credit card system** supplied by **Payflo Pro** for processing credit cards. All credit card payments are processed by **Payflo Pro**. We do not store any credit card numbers.

While we strive to protect your personal information we cannot insure or warrant the security of any information transmitted by the customer via email or customer response forms.

We may at our discretion update or revise this privacy policy at any time. Any changes will take effect immediately once they are posted on our website. Your continued use of our services after any changes have been posted on our websites indicates your acceptance to those changes.
