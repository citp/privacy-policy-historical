  <p>
  Superblock, LLC ("Superblock", "we", "us", "our") provides online and mobile

  include information that identifies your current Pushover application
  version, your device operating system version, your device hardware
  manufacturer and model number, and your Pushover device client license
  status.  No personally-identifiable information (such as a device-specific
  "UUID") is sent with these requests.

  </p></li>
  <li><p>We transfer information about you if Pushover or Superblock, LLC is

  notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to
  a different privacy policy.</p></li>
