**Collecting Information**

I collect information from you when you register on my site or subscribe to my newsletter. When ordering or registering on my site, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your e-mail address.

You may, however, visit my site anonymously.

**Use Of Information**

Any of the information I collect from you may be used in one of the following ways:

Your information, whether public or private, will not be sold, exchanged, transferred, or given to any other company for any reason whatsoever, without your consent, other than for the express purpose of delivering the purchased product or service requested; to administer a contest, promotion, survey or other site feature; or to send periodic emails.

The email address you provide for order processing, may be used to send you information and updates pertaining to your order, in addition to receiving occasional company news, updates, related product or service information, promotions, and so on.

Note: If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, I have included a one-click unsubscribe link at the bottom of each email.

**Protecting Your Information**

I implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information.

**Disclosing Information To Outside Parties**

I do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information.

This does not include trusted third parties who assist in operating this website, conducting this business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential.

I may also release your information when I believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce my site policies, or protect our own (or others) rights, property, or safety.

However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.

Occasionally, at my discretion, I may include or offer third party products or services on this website. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies.
