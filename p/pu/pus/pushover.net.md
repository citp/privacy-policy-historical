# Pushover: Privacy Policy

Superblock, LLC ("Superblock", "we", "us", "our") provides online and mobile services, including but not limited to, the Pushover website ("Pushover.net" or the "Site"), API, and mobile applications (collectively, the "Service"). Superblock is committed to maintaining the privacy, integrity and security of any personal information about our users. 

This Privacy Policy ("Policy") explains how we protect personal information we collect in connection with your use of the Service and how we use and in some cases disclose that information.

This Policy is subject to the provisions our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms), which are incorporated by reference. 

### What Personal Information We Collect

Your Pushover service works in conjunction with a user account on Pushover.net (a "User Account"). When you sign up for a Pushover User Account from our mobile applications or our Site, you are required to provide an e-mail address (which will be used as your login ID) and to create an account password (collectively the "Registration Information"). 

During the course of using your Pushover Service, the Pushover device client applications will routinely synchronize your notification data with Pushover servers. These requests sent from your Pushover device client application include information that identifies your current Pushover application version, your device operating system version, your device hardware manufacturer and model number, and your Pushover device client license status. No personally-identifiable information (such as a device-specific "UUID") is sent with these requests.

  * Provide you with the Service;

  * Deliver to you any administrative notices and communications relevant to your use of the Pushover Service;
