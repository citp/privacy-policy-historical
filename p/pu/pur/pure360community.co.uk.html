Except as set out below, we do not share, or sell, or disclose to a third party, any personally identifiable information collected at this site. If this policy should change in the future, then we will provide notification in advance and users have the opportunity to indicate whether or not they would prefer that we do not provide the information to third parties as proposed. </p> <p>Here is a list of the information we collect, and why it is necessary to collect it:</p> <h2>Information supplied by our clients and relating to third parties</h2> <p>Third party information such as names, e-mail addresses and information which relates to the industry or business of a party.
