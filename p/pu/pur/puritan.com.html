						 cares about your privacy.  We respect the privacy of all your personal information and understand the need to protect it.
						  We are committed to giving you choices about your personal information.  This policy will tell you more about our commitment to your privacy, 
						  explain what information we collect and how it is used, and provide you with specific choices concerning that information.  
						  This policy applies to consumers accessing Puritan's Pride's sites, and those of its affiliates, in the United States.
						<br><br>
					<span class="Bold12_Blue1">Our Commitment</span><br><br>
						Puritan's Pride, as a member of the Direct Marketing Association (DMA), follows the DMA's "Privacy Promise to American Consumers."  
						We (1) provide customers with notice of their ability to opt out of information sharing with other marketers; 
						   (2) honor customers' requests not to share their information with other marketers; and 
						   (3) honor customers' requests not to receive solicitations from Puritan's Pride. 
						<br><br>
					<span class="Bold12_Blue1">The Information We Collect</span><br><br>
						In general, you can visit many of our web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself.   
						However, we receive and store certain types of information whenever you visit one of our sites. We may track the Internet domain address
						 from which people visit us and analyze this data for trends and statistics, but individual users will remain anonymous, unless you voluntarily tell us who you are. 
						 We may use "cookies" that allow our system to recognize your browser and help us personalize your online experience.  <br><br>

                        We also may receive information about you, such as updated delivery and address information, from other sources.  
                        In the course of our business, we may sell or buy stores, subsidiaries or other business units.  
                        Customer data may be transferred in a business transaction, but it will remain subject to our privacy policy.<br><br>

                        There may be times, such as when you order a product, register to receive catalogs or email offers, or register to participate in other services or promotions, 
                        at which we ask you to provide information about yourself.  This could include your name, shipping and billing addresses, 
                        telephone numbers, email addresses, and credit card or other information.<br><br>

                        Whether or not you provide such information is completely your own choice. But if you choose not to provide the information we request,
                        you may be unable to access certain services or promotions. 

						<br><br>
					<span class="Bold12_Blue1">How We Use Your Information</span><br>
						We use the personally identifiable information you provide for internal purposes, such as confirming and tracking your order, 
						confirming your receipt of emails, registration, analyzing trends and statistics, informing you of our new products, services, offers, and promotions and so on. 
						Puritan's Pride may share or store your information with that of our affiliated companies.  Also, from time to time, we engage others to perform certain functions for us. 
						We may give third party providers access to personal information to the extent they need it to perform their tasks, 
						but we do not permit them to use this information for any other purpose.   In addition, we may share your information with select marketing partners. 
						It is our intention that these companies be highly targeted to your interests and preferences. 
						We describe below how you may choose to opt-out of contact from our marketing partners.<br><br>
						
						
						To serve you better, we may combine information you give us online, in stores, through mailings, or other marketing media. 
						We use that combined information to enhance and personalize your shopping experience with us, and to communicate with you about our products, 
						services and promotions that may be of interest to you
						<br><br>
					<span class="Bold12_Blue1">We Provide You Choices</span><br>
						We want to tailor our communication with you to your preferences.<br>
						If you prefer not to hear from our marketing partners, please call 1-800-527-3000.<br>
                        If you would like to subscribe to receive marketing offers or solicitations from Puritan's Pride via email, please  <a href="/house/newsletter.asp?xs=" target="_top">Click here </a>.<br>
						If you prefer not to receive marketing offers or solicitations from Puritan's Pride via direct mail, please call 1-800-527-3000 <br>
						If you prefer not to receive marketing offers or solicitations from Puritan's Pride via email, please  <a href="/house/newsletter.asp?xs=" target="_top">Click here</a>  or call 1-800-527-3000.<br>
						
						Please note that sometimes these requests may take up to 90 days to be effective, particularly if we are removing your name from mailing lists.  
						We reserve the right to contact you concerning any purchases you have made with us or in regard to any services or promotions of which you are already taking advantage.<br><br>
						
						As mentioned above, if you choose not to provide us with certain information, you may not be able to access certain services or promotions.<br><br>
					<span class="Bold12_Blue1">We Care About the Safety of Children</span><br>
						Puritan's Pride cares about the safety of children and the privacy of their personal information. This site is intended for a general audience.

						Web servers, ours or trusted partner's, send information to your computer when you are on our Website.  This information is stored on your computer's hard drive. 
						It is called a "cookie".  Cookies are used to help us understand what products, services and promotions might interest you.

						<br><br>
					<span class="Bold12_Blue1">Security</span><br>
						We strive to use the most sophisticated technology to protect your personal information and we are looking to raise our standards, whenever possible.  
						Please be aware that information that passes over the Internet is not all in our control.  Therefore, we cannot offer any guarantees about the security of your data while it is in transmission.  
						Use of the Internet in general carries a certain risk.  After your personal information is transmitted to us, we will do everything we reasonably can to protect it.
						<br><br>
					<span class="Bold12_Blue1">Other Websites</span><br>
						We do not control the Privacy Policies of sites that may be linked to ours.  If you have a question or concern about Privacy on a site, 
						please be sure to read the policy of that site.
						<br><br>
					<span class="Bold12_Blue1">We Follow the Law</span><br>	
					    We share information with law enforcement if required to do so by law, by court order or by other legal processes.  
					    If you are a California resident, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 may entitle you to receive additional information from us regarding our 
					    disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes and your right to opt-out of such disclosure.  
					    Please email us or call us using the addresses above, if you do not want us to share your name and contact information with any third parties, 
					    or notify us at any time by writing to us at the postal mail address below.<br><br>
					<span class="Bold12_Blue1">Updating Our Privacy Policy</span><br>
					    We may decide to update our privacy policy, partially or in its entirety, at any time.  If we do, we will post a notice on our Website, with an effective date for the new policy.  
					    The policy will be reviewed from time to time, or as required by changes in the law.  We expect to review the policy at least once a year.<br><br>
					<span class="Bold12_Blue1">We Care About What You Think</span><br>	
					    If you have any suggestions for changes to our policy, or if you'd like a copy of the policy mailed to you, you may email us at:<a href="mailto:privacy@puritan.com">privacy@puritan.com</a>  or write to us at:
