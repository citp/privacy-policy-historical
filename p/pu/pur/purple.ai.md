This policy applies to all the websites We operate, Our use of emails, and any other methods We use for collecting information. It covers what We collect and why, what We do with the information, what We won’t do with the information, and what rights you have.

Personal data collected through Our WiFi service is configured by Our customers (who operate the venues where you access the WiFi) through their end-user registration and you should consult their privacy policy for full details of the data they are collecting and how they intend to use it.

This privacy policy only applies to personal information We hold about individuals. It does not apply to information We hold about companies and other organisations.

We may update this privacy policy from time to time by publishing the amended version on Our website.

Unfortunately, the transmission of data across the internet is not completely secure. While We do Our best to try to protect the security of your information, We cannot ensure or guarantee that loss, misuse, or alteration of data will not occur while data is being transferred.

We will keep your information only for as long as We need it to provide you with the services or information you have required, to administer your relationship with Us, to comply with the law, or to ensure We do not communicate with people that have asked Us not to. When We no longer need information, We will always dispose of it securely by using specialist companies if necessary to do this work for Us.
