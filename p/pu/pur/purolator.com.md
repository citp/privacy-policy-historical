Any information that you choose to provide to Purolator is intended to be used to personalize and improve your shipping experience with us. All information is collected and stored in a secure manner supervised by Purolator. Access to your information is restricted to selected Purolator employees.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a small file containing certain pieces of information that a web site creates when you visit it. A cookie can track how and when you use a web site and/or other web sites which you visited and can store that information. 

There are two common types of cookies, "session cookies" and "persistent cookies". 

Session cookies store information only for the length of time that you are connected to a web site - they are not written onto your hard drive. Once you leave the web site, the originator of the cookie no longer has the information that was contained on it.

Purolator uses session cookies as an additional security feature. When you log on to Purolator Online Shipping and are authenticated through your User ID and password, a cookie will store the identification number of your browser. Throughout your session, the session cookie acts as a type of digital signature to identify your current session to the web server. The web server will monitor the number of your browser to ensure that, at all times during your session, we are dealing with you.

Purolator also uses session cookies to track your visits within our web site. Purolator uses that information to determine the type of information that you are looking for on our web site and to improve our web site. Purolator uses information about the site you visited immediately prior to our site to assess the viability of links to our site that we have created on third party sites.

The information stored in "persistent cookies" is written onto your hard drive and remains there until the expiry date of the cookie. Purolator uses persistent cookies to store non-sensitive information that you are aware of and have agreed to. For example, if you choose the option on our log on screen to remember your User ID, the system will remember and automatically input your User ID each time you use Purolator Online Shipping.

Currently, most browsers do not distinguish between session cookies and persistent cookies. For Purolator Online Shipping to operate, your browser must be set to accept cookies. If you are concerned about having your browser enabled to accept cookies while you are surfing other web sites, we recommend that you enable your browser to notify you when it is receiving a cookie. This gives you the ability of accepting or rejecting any cookie presented by the web server you are visiting. We suggest you contact the manufacturer of your browser for information on how to do this.
