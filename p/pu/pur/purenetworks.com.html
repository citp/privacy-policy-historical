Your privacy is very important to Pure Networks, so we have created the following Privacy Policy to explain our information collection and use practices.  Our Privacy Policy covers what information we collect through our products and services, how this information is used and how you may opt-out of this collection.    Please take a moment to read the following policy to learn how we handle the information we collect.  By using our products and services, you consent and agree to the information collection and practices described in this policy.
</p><p>
<strong>Why we collect personal information</strong>
<br>
Pure Networks collects and uses your personal information to give you superior customer service, provide you with convenient access to our products and services,  alert you to available upgrades and products and make a wider range of our products available to you. In addition, with your permission, we use your personal information to keep you up to date on the latest product announcements, special offers and other related information.  With your permission, this may occasionally include information from other technology companies about products and services that can add value to your Pure Networks products. From time to time, we may also use your personal information to contact you to participate in a market research survey, so that we can gauge customer satisfaction and develop better products. 
</p><p>
<strong>How we collect personal information</strong>
<br>
We collect information about you in the following ways.  When you download one of our products, we ask you for contact information so we can communicate with you about your product trial and product keys.  When you purchase a product from Pure Networks or Network Magic, we require your contact and payment information for billing purposes.  We might also ask for your contact information when you correspond with us, contact us to request support, register to attend a seminar, or participate in an online survey. When you register a new Pure Networks product or ask to be included in an e-mail mailing list, we collect and store the information you provide in a secure database. 
</p><p>
To save you time and make our Web services even easier to use, some areas of the Pure Networks site allow you to create a "Pure Networks ID" using your personal information. Here's how it works: Simply fill out a brief profile遥our name, phone number, and e-mail address葉hen choose a password and password hint (such as the month and day of your birth) for security. The system saves your information and assigns you a personal Pure Networks ID. Next time you order something from the Pure Networks Store or register a new product, you can simply enter your e-mail address and password葉he system will automatically look up the information it needs. 
</p><p>
<strong>Opting out or unsubscribing from email communications:</strong>
<br>
When downloading or purchasing we give you the option to opt out of future email communications other than critical updates.  You can also unsubscribe or subscribe at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link included in our email communications and on our web sites under Support.   You can also change your preference by clicking on the link below:

<strong>When we disclose personal information</strong>
<br>

<li>At times we may be required by law or legal process to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we believe that disclosure is necessary for the public interest. </li>
<li>If Pure Networks or a portion of our assets are acquired by another company, customer information, including personally identifiable information, may be one of the transferred assets.</li>
