Contracts for the rental of the property are entered into directly between you and person(s) or entity wishing to make a booking without any involvement on our part. We are entitled to require you to produce appropriate proof of your individual identity, your ownership of the property or authority to represent the owner in advertising and entering into contracts for use of the property for holiday purposes.

You grant us a perpetual, royalty free, worldwide licence to display, use and reproduce all material posted on the website as we consider appropriate for the purpose of or in connection with advertising the property on the website.

**Termination**  
23\. We are entitled to terminate the advertising of any property immediately on giving the property owner notice in writing (which may be by way of an e-mail to their last known e-mail address) (1) in the event of any material or repeated breach of these terms or any other terms which relate to the advertising of the property on the website by the property owner or any breach of these terms or any such other terms following any warning or communication from us in relation to any breach of these terms or any such other terms or (2) in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of the property owner or (3) in the event of our having reason to believe that the property owner is no longer able to offer the property for holiday rental purposes either at all or for the reasonably foreseeable future or for substantial periods of time, for whatever reason or (4) in the event of our having reason to believe that the property owner is not complying with the law or any other legal requirements relating to the property or the letting of the same in any respect or is in any way behaving in a manner which may in our sole opinion damage or potentially damage our reputation or the reputation of the website. In the event of termination in any such circumstances, no refund of any payment made to us by the property owner will be made and we will have no liability whatsoever to the property owner.

**Owner VERIFICATION badge**    
24\. The VERIFIED badge used by pureholidayhomes.com on its site is an indication that the owner of a property detailed on its site has undergone a rigorous examination into their identity (using GB Group’s identity verification services) for the purposes of preventing fraud. If you wish to check that the owner of a particular property detailed on pureholidayhomes.com’s site that is using the VERIFIED badge has been vetted by pureholidayhomes.com, please contact us at [contact@pureholidayhomes.com](mailto:contact@pureholidayhomes.com) with details of the property concerned.  We will then run a check of the details against our database. GB Group’s ID verification system, which is used by pureholidayhomes.com, checks the credentials of property owners advertising on its site against a number of national and international databases.  Although the process is rigorous, it cannot provide an absolute guarantee against instances of fraud occurring.  Consequently, neither GB Group or pureholidayhomes.com accept responsibility for any loss, liability and damage that may be incurred by users of this site as a result of a fraudulent representation made any person advertising their property on this site and all warranties, conditions and other terms implied by statute or common law are hereby excluded.
