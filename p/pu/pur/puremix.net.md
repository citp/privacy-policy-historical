**Third Parties.  
** The Puremix Services may be linked to or provided through Internet websites or other platforms operated by other companies.

For example, users can use the Puremix Services on the websites of Puremix's authorized third party distributors. Puremix is not responsible for the privacy practices of the websites or other platforms operated by third parties. Once you have left the Puremix Site by clicking on a link, or if you are using the Puremix Services on another website or platform, you should check the privacy policy of the other website or platform to determine how it handles any personally identifiable information it collects from you. 

Puremix carries advertisements from other companies, often with the ability to click through to websites or properties run by these other companies.

Once you have left the Puremix Site by clicking on an advertisement, you should check the privacy policy of the advertiser to determine how it handles any personally identifiable information it separately collects from you. Please be aware that Puremix does not warn you when you have chosen to link through to another website or property from the Puremix Site.   

We may use your personally identifiable information to:

i.    Provide you with promotional information about Puremix's features, services, and other offerings that may be of interest to you; or   
ii.   Provide information or offers to you that are related to the Puremix Services on behalf of Puremix's business partners . 

Only with your consent, we also may share your personally identifiable information (such as username or email address) with advertisers, business partners, and other entities that are not affiliated with Puremix who would like to send you promotional information about their products and services directly.   
If we sell all or part of our business, or make a sale or transfer of assets, or are otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy, we will transfer your personally identifiable information to one or more third parties as part of that transaction.

Aggregate data is information that we collect on an individualized basis (for example, statistics about which videos you watch) but subsequently use in aggregate form (that is, in a way that combines information about individuals together so that no individual is identifiable). We may use aggregate data for a variety of purposes, including for research or analysis, website administration, advertising, and promotional purposes. Although aggregate data may be based in part on personally identifiable information about you (for example, we may want to know the general age range or country of residence of visitors watching videos on our site), it does not identify you personally.

We may share aggregated information with various affiliated and unaffiliated entities. For example, IP addresses are used for system administration and to provide anonymous aggregated data to advertisers about the volume of use on the Puremix Services and the specific Puremix Services in which users are most interested. We also may share information about our users with advertisers so they can measure the effectiveness of advertisements viewed on the Puremix Services. For example, we may tell advertisers the number of users who clicked on a particular advertisement. Because this form of data does not identify particular users, these third parties will not be able to contact you based solely on this data. 

**Protection.  
** We use reasonable physical, technical, and administrative measures to safeguard personally identifiable information in our possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification. We also take steps to ensure that only those Puremix employees, agents, and contractors who have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to your personally identifiable information are granted access. 

Despite these efforts, please note that no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We want you to feel confident using the Puremix Services but we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.
