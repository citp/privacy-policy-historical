## Viewing Statistics

Aggregate data is information that we collect on an individualized basis (for example, statistics about which videos you watch) but subsequently use in aggregate form (that is, in a way that combines information about individuals together so that no individual is identifiable). We may use aggregate data for a variety of purposes, including for research or analysis, website administration, advertising, royalties calculation and promotional purposes. Although aggregate data may be based in part on personally identifiable information about you (for example, we may want to know which videos have been watched this month and for how long in order to calculate royalties), it does not identify you personally.

Please note that we may share aggregated and **non-personally identifiable** information with our advertisers so they can measure the effectiveness of advertisements viewed in connection with the Puremix Services. For example, we may tell advertisers the number of users who clicked on a particular advertisement.

## Giveaways & Promotions

Puremix runs regular giveaways for software and hardware products in association with third parties.
