<p>A web beacon is generally a transparent graphic image (usually a very small pixel) that is placed on a website or in an email which is
used to monitor behavior of a user visiting a website or email. When HTML code for a web beacon points to a site to retrieve the image,
it can pass along information such as IP address of the computer that retrieved the image, time the page was viewed and length, the type
of internet browser that retrieved the image, and any previously set cookie values in regards to the web beacon.</p>

<h2 class="text-uppercase">LINKS</h2>

<p>This Privacy Policy only pertains to the Website and the Purebits Services. Other websites, such as those to which the Website links to
