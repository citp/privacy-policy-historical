                <b>PRIVACY STATEMENT</b></p>
            <p>
                PureRomance.com collects client information to enhance your shopping experience.
                This privacy policy is intended to assist you in understanding what information
                we gather about you when you visit this Web site, how we use that information, and
                the safeguards we have in place for that information.
            </p>
            <p>
                This online privacy statement applies to Pure Romance Parties, Inc. and covers the
                U.S. corporate-operated Pure Romance website (www.PureRomance.com). Pure Romance
                Consultants may also operate their own websites. Each Consultant is an independent
                contractor having the right to operate their own Pure Romance business. In this
                regard, Consultant online privacy may vary.

            <p>
                1. General Browsing Information<br>
                PureRomance.com gathers navigational information during each visitor's use of our
                Web site. In the process of gathering navigational information, non-personally identifiable
                information (i.e. domain type, browser version, service provider and IP address)
                may be collected. The navigational information tells PureRomance.com about the use
                of our Web site by visitors, including the areas of our site that are most visited
                or the time of a last visit to a page on our site. It also tells us about the technical
                efficiencies of our Web site and services (i.e. the time it takes a visitor to connect
                to our Web site or download pages). The navigational information helps us better
                understand a visitor's experience at PureRomance.com and improve upon that experience
                by recognizing and delivering more of the features, services and products our visitors
                prefer.

            <p>
                PureRomance.com takes the following types of security measures: use of technologies
                and policies such as limited access data-centers, firewall technology, secure socket
                layer certificate authentication and limitations of administrative access to our

                In fact, this is a practice we encourage you to adopt in all of your Internet activities.
            </p>
            <p>
                We designed PureRomance.com to accept orders only from Web browsers that permit
                communication through Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology; for example, 4.0 versions
                or higher of Netscape Navigator, versions 5.01 or higher of Internet Explorer, versions
                0.8 or higher of Firefox and versions 1.2 or higher of Safari.
