Secure Shopping

We want your online shopping to be worry-free, so we use SSL (Secure Socket Layers), the most advanced online ordering security system available. All of your personal information, including your credit card number, is encrypted by SSL.

SSL encrypts your order information to avoid the decoding of that information by anyone other than the security of your connection, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), then SSL is active. You can also double-click by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https".

We use third-party web beacons from Yahoo! to help analyze where visitors go and what they do while visiting our website. Yahoo! may also use anonymous information about your visits to this and other websites in order to improve its products and services and provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
