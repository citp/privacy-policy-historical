### 1\. What does this Privacy Notice apply to?

This Privacy Notice applies to personal information that we collect from or about our consumers or customers through the methods described in this section. Please note we may combine personal information that we collect via one method (e.g., a website) with personal information that we collect via another method (e.g., an offline event). 

We do this to get a more complete view of our consumers, which, in turn, allows us to serve you better and with more customisation. 

1.1 Nestlé websites 

This refers to any consumer-directed websites operated by Nestlé, including websites that we operate under our own domains/URLs and websites that we run on third party social networks such as Facebook (e.g. Facebook fan page). 

Back to top of section 1

1.2 Nestlé mobile sites/applications 

This refers to any consumer-directed mobile sites or applications operated by Nestlé, including our smartphone apps (e.g., iPhone apps).

For example, we may hire a third party data aggregator to provide us additional information about our existing consumers (this is known as “data appending”) or we may use a third party to collect consumer data from ur online advertisements. We may also receive information from third party co-sponsors who we may occasionally partner with to run special contests or other promotions. We may also receive information about consumers when we acquire other companies or businesses.

### 

### 2.        What information do we collect?

Depending on how you interact with us (online, offline, over the phone, etc.), we may collect from you various types of information (personal and aggregate), as described in this section. 

Personal information (as used in this Privacy Notice) refers to such types of information that can be used to personally identify you, whereas aggregate information does not allow for such identification on its own. 

In some instances (and unless we say otherwise below), we may combine/link one type of information with another type of information (e.g., personal contact information with account login and/or demographic information) and store them together in our records. In cases, where personal and aggregate information are combined, such information will always be considered as personal information. We strive to limit the amount of personal information we collect and store to that which is reasonably necessary to provide you the relevant services. We generally store your personal information for as long as your account is active with us or as needed to provide you the relevant services. We may store your personal information for a longer period of time to comply with legal or regulatory obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, or for records management purposes. 

2.1 Personal contact information 

This includes any information that would allow us to personally contact you, such as your name, home or mailing address, phone number (home, mobile phone, etc.), or email address. In some cases, this could include personal information that you give us about someone else (for example, if you provide a friend’s email address for a tell-a-friend program). We typically collect personal contact information in connection with a variety of activities, including general website registration, newsletter sign-up, website community features, online purchases, customer service inquiries, contests and other promotions, and consumer surveys. If you create an account with us, your personal contact information may be stored under your account profile. 

Back to top of section 2

2.2 Account login information 

This refers to any information that is required for you to establish a unique account with us or for us to give you access to your specific account profile. Examples may include your login ID/email address, screen name, password, and/or security question and answer. We only collect unique login information for those activities that require an account, such as general website registration, newsletter sign-up, and website community features. Your login information, especially your password, should be kept confidential and never shared with anyone else. To change your login email address or password, log in to the relevant edit account section of our site (if available) or [Contact Us](https://www.purina.co.uk/contact-us). 

Back to top of section 2

2.3 Demographic information 

This includes any information that describes your demographic or psychographic characteristics. Examples may include your date of birth, age or age range, gender, geographic location (e.g., post code, city and state, mobile location), favourite products, hobbies and interests, and household or lifestyle information. We typically collect demographic information in connection with a variety of activities, including general website registration, newsletter sign-up, website community registration, contests and other promotions, and consumer surveys. If you create an account with us, you may be allowed to modify certain demographic information stored under your account. To do so, log in to the relevant edit account section of our site (if available) or contact Consumer Services. For demographic information stored under your profile on a third party social network (e.g., Facebook), see separate paragraph on “Social network info.” 

Back to top of section 2

2.4 Technical computer information 

This includes any information about the computer system or other technological device that you may be using to access one of our websites, applications or online advertisements. We typically collect this information through automated technologies such as cookies and web beacons. Examples of technical computer information may include your computer’s IP address, operating system type, and web browser type. If you access a Nestlé website or application via a mobile device such as a smartphone, the collected information may also include your phone’s unique device ID, and other similar mobile device data. See further our [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/cookies) and the answers to Question 8 “Tracking Technology – How and why we use it?” below. 

Back to top of section 2          

2.5 Website usage information 

This includes information about how you use and navigate our websites, applications and online advertisements, including which links you click on, which pages or content you view and for how long, and other similar information and statistics about your interactions with a Nestlé website or application (e.g., date and time of visit, which site you came from, favourite recipes and site activities, high game scores, etc.). This information is captured using automated tracking technologies such as browser cookies, flash cookies, and web beacons, and may also be collected through the use of third party tracking services (such as Google Analytics) that collect data in aggregate (such as number of visits to a particular page, or the amount of time spent on a web site). We may also use these technologies, such as web beacons, to capture information about how users respond to certain email campaigns (e.g., time the email is opened, where user links to from the email, etc.). Please see further our [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/cookies)answers to Question 8 “Tracking Technology – How and why we use it?”. 

We may also partner with one or more third party ad networks to either display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other sites including mobile sites or applications. We or our ad network partner may use cookies and web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising on our websites or other entities’ websites based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by following the instructions in our [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/cookies) . Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads. 

Back to top of section 2

2.6 Consumer feedback 

This includes information that you voluntarily share with us about your experience in using our products and services, including our websites and applications. Examples may include unsolicited comments and suggestions, testimonials, or other questions or feedback related to our products. We typically collect this information in the form of consumer surveys, consumer panels, contact forms, “Ask the Expert” forms, and email correspondence. 

Back to top of section 2

2.7 Consumer-generated content 

This refers to any content that you create and then share with us (and perhaps others) by uploading it to one of our websites or applications, including one of our Facebook sites. Examples may include photos, videos, personal stories, or other similar media or content. We may collect and publish consumer-generated content in connection with a variety of activities, including contests and other promotions, website community features, consumer engagement, and third party social networking. 

Back to top of section 2

2.8 Social network information 

This refers to any information that is part of your profile on a third party social network (such as but not limited to Facebook) and that you allow the third party social network to share with us. Examples include your basic account information (e.g., name, email address, gender, birthday, current city, profile picture, user ID, list of friends, etc.) and any other additional information or activities that you permit the third party social network to share with third party application developers. For example, we may receive your social network profile information (or parts of it) every time you download or interact with a Nestlé web application on a social network such as Facebook or Twitter or every time you use a social networking feature that is integrated within a Nestlé website (such as Facebook Connect). To learn more about how your information from a third party social network may be obtained by us (or other third party application developers), please visit the website of the relevant social network. You further acknowledge using your personal information to match information with a social network for advertising purposes.

Back to top of section 2

2.10 Other information (depending on context) 

This refers to any other information that we might need to collect for a specific Nestlé form, feature, or other service that you use or request.

### 

### 3\. For what purposes do we use your personal information?

The following paragraphs describe the various purposes and features for which we might collect and use your personal information, and the different types of information that might be collected from you through the different methods described in Question 1 above. Please note that not all of the uses below will be relevant to every consumer. 

3.1 Account maintenance 

We may use your personal information to maintain your accounts with us, including administering any consumer loyalty or rewards programs that are associated with your account. This typically involves the use of personal information that was originally collected to set up your account (e.g., personal contact information, payment information, account login information, demographic information, etc.). 

Back to top of section 3

3.2 Customer service 

We may collect and use your personal information to provide you customer service, including responses to your inquiries. This typically requires the collection and use of certain personal contact information (such as your name or email address) and information regarding the reason for your inquiry (e.g., order status, technical issue, product question/complaint, general question, etc.). Customer service may be provided through various forms of communication, including email correspondence, call centre support, and live online chat features. 

Back to top of section 3

3.3 Product improvement and customisation 

We may collect and use your information so we can constantly improve our products, tailor them to your needs, and come up with new product ideas. This mostly involves the collection and use of demographic information and consumer feedback. 

Back to top of section 3

3.4 Consumer engagement 

We may collect and use your personal information to encourage you to be more actively engaged with our products and services (including our websites and applications), thereby increasing overall brand engagement and awareness. This mostly involves the collection, use, and publication of consumer-generated content. 

Back to top of section 3

3.5 Contests and other promotions 

We may collect and use your personal information to administer a contest, sweepstakes, giveaway, competition, or other similar marketing campaign or promotion. These events typically require the collection and use of personal contact information (for prize fulfilment), demographic information (for eligibility determination), and, in some instances, consumer-generated content. Some of our promotions may be run on third party social networks such as Facebook (for example, on our Facebook fan pages). To comply with legal requirements, we may publish or share a limited amount of personal information (such as name and city of residence) about the winners of a particular promotion. For more information about our contests and other promotions, please see the official rules or details posted with each promotion. 

Back to top of section 3

3.6 Marketing communications 

We may collect and use your personal information to send you marketing communications, such as email communications, SMS text messages, and postal mailings. Please note that if you choose to receive SMS text messages, your mobile service provider’s fees for messaging will apply. We may also show you marketing communications on other websites, including on social media sites where you are a member, by matching activities or information collected on our websites and online advertisements with those collected on third party sites (“Targeted Advertising”). These marketing communications will keep you up-to-date on the latest news, events, special offers, and promotions from our brands of interest to you. On occasion, these communications may also introduce you to other Nestlé brands and inform you about offers and promotions from other third party companies. Sending you marketing communications mostly requires the collection and use of certain personal contact information and demographic information. In some instances (such as for mobile apps and text messaging programs), this could involve the use of your precise geo-location, which may allow us to send you location-based offers and promotions. 

You can always opt-out from receiving marketing-related email communications or text messages by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in each such communication. If you have an account with us, you may be given the option to change your communication preferences under the relevant edit-account section of our site (if available) or by [Contacting Us](https://www.purina.co.uk/). Changing these preferences would also remove you from our lists for future Targeted Advertising. You may also visit social media sites where you are a member to explore opt out options they may provide for Targeted Advertising.  Please note that even if you opt out from receiving marketing communications from us, you may still receive administrative communications from us, such as order confirmations, notifications about your account activities (e.g., account confirmations, password changes, etc.), and other important announcements. You will also still see generic ads on other websites, including on social media sites where you are a member. 

Also, please note that if you participated in a promotion that involved a third party company, and, as part of that promotion, you agreed to receive future marketing communications directly from that third party, you will need to contact the third party (not Nestlé) to opt-out from such communications. This process may be outlined in the third party’s privacy policy. 

Back to top of section 3

3.7 Third party social networking 

We may collect and use your personal information when you interact with third party social networking features such as “Facebook Connect” or “Facebook Like”. These features may be integrated in our sites or applications for the purposes of running contests (or similar activities), allowing you to share content with friends, or other stated purposes. If you use these features, we may have the ability to obtain certain information about you from your social networking profile (see “Social network information” under Question 2 of this Privacy Notice). You can learn more about how these features work, and the profile data we may obtain about you, by visiting the website of the relevant third party social network. 

Back to top of section 3

3.8 Website improvement and personalisation 

We may collect and use your information to improve and personalise your experience on our websites, applications and online advertisements. This is typically done through automated tracking technologies (please also see Question 8) that collect and remember certain account login information, technical information, and/or previous website usage information. For example, we might remember your login ID/email address or screen name so you can quickly login the next time you visit our site or so you can easily retrieve the items you previously placed in your shopping cart. Based on this type of information, we may also show you specific Nestlé content or promotions that are tailored to your interests. 

Back to top of section 3

3.9 Website community features 

We may collect and use your personal information to give you access to website community features, including features that may allow you to upload and share recipes, pictures, videos, artwork, or other messages or content. This typically involves the collection, use, and (in some instances) public display of certain personal contact information, account login information, demographic information, and/or consumer-generated content. Because these features are “communal” in nature, information or content that you post in these areas may be visible to others. Please use caution when using these features or uploading content to a Nestlé site. For some community features, we may give you the ability to control whether some parts of your profile can be seen by others. To access these settings, log in to the relevant edit account section of our site (if one is available) and access your community profile. For website community features that have social networking integration (such as “Facebook Connect”), see separate paragraph on “Third party social networking”. 

Back to top of section 3

3.10 Website viral features (e.g., tell-a-friend) 

We may request and use your personal information so you can use website viral features, such as our tell-a-friend features. These features allow you to easily share certain news, product information, promotions, wish list items, or other content with family members and friends. These features typically require the collection and use of personal contact information (such as names and email addresses) so that the selected one-time message or content can be delivered to the proper recipients. In most cases, we do not retain the information provided. In some cases (for example, as part of a refer-a-friend program), we may store the information so we can track and reward consumers for their successful referrals. For tell-a-friend or other viral features administered by third party social networks (such as Facebook’s “Share” and “Like” features), please refer to the website of the relevant social network for additional information. 

Back to top of section 3

3.11 Order fulfilment 

We may collect and use your personal information to process and ship your orders, and to inform you about the status of your orders. This could involve the collection and use of certain personal contact information, payment information, account login information, and/or other information related to your purchase (such as products ordered). This could also involve the on-going storage of your payment information to allow for easier checkout on future purchases.  Where orders are being fulfilled by a third party, we will share your personal information with them for the purposes of fulfilment of the order.  You may, as a result, also receive communications from that third party (whether by email, SMS or other methods of communication) regarding the fulfilment of the order. 

Back to top of section 3

3.12 Other general purposes (e.g., website security, internal research) 

We may collect and use your information for other general business purposes, such as to maintain the day-to-day operation and security of our websites and applications and to conduct internal marketing and demographic studies. These activities mostly require the collection and use of certain demographic information, technical computer information, website usage information, and consumer feedback.

### 4\. How do we protect your personal information?

We take all necessary technical and organisational measures to protect the confidentiality and security of your personal information collected through the various methods described in this Privacy Notice. These efforts include, but are not necessarily limited to: (i) storing your personal information in secure operating environments that are not available to the public and that are only accessible to authorized Nestlé employees, and our service providers, agents and those with whom we have contracts; (ii) using industry-standard SSL encryption (or similar) to protect the security of certain sensitive personal information (such as credit card information, health or patient information) during transmission, and, (iii) verifying the identities of registered users before they can access the personal information we maintain about them. 

Back to top of Privacy Policy

### 

### 5\. What happens if you refuse to provide your personal information?

If you choose not to submit any personal information when requested, you may not be able to participate in certain activities and personalised features and may limit the services and special offers we can provide you. For example, if you do not wish  to share with us your email address, you will not be able to receive any of our electronic newsletters or otherwise register on our websites or use our applications. If you refuse to provide your credit card number, you will not be able to purchase products at a Nestlé Online Store. However, to simply browse our websites and learn more about our products, you do not need to give us any personal information. 

Back to top of Privacy Policy

### 

### 6\. Who do we disclose your personal information to and why?

Nestlé will never share your personal information with any third party that intends to use it for direct marketing purposes unless we have specifically informed you and you have given us specific permission to do this. 

We may share your personal information with our subsidiary companies, companies in which Nestlé S.A. has control through either direct or indirect ownership (collectively “Nestlé Group”). Some of these are located outside the EEA. Nestlé may also share your personal information with third parties (some of whom are outside the EEA), but only in the following circumstances: 

6.1 Service Providers, Agents and Contractors 

We may use third parties, like service providers, agents or contractors to provide support for the internal operations of our websites, applications and online advertisements and to assist us with administering our websites, applications and online advertisements or the various functions, programs and promotions (and similar) available to you and generally for the purposes described in this Notice. Some of these third parties may be located outside the country where you accessed this website. These third parties and its employees may come into contact with your personal information in the course of providing their services to us.  Any such third party must at all times provide equivalent levels of security for your personal information as Nestlé and, where required, are bound by a legal agreement to keep your personal information private, secure and to process it only on the specific instructions of Nestlé. 

Back to top of section 6

6.2 Partners and Joint Promotions 

From time to time, we may run a joint or co-sponsored program or promotion on our website or application with another company, organization, or other reputable third party; and, as part of this event, collect and process personal information. If your personal information is being collected by (or is shared with) a company other than Nestlé as part of such promotion, we will let you know this at the time your personal information is collected. Periodically, we may run a promotion on our website or application that features the products or services of another company and will give you the opportunity to opt in to receive information directly from that third party company. When doing any promotion involving another company, we may provide a separate link to that company's privacy policy and we encourage you to read it before you share any personal information, as we cannot guarantee they adhere to the same privacy practices. If you do not want your information to be collected by or shared with a company other than ours, you can always choose not to opt in or participate in these events at the time the personal information is collected/requested. 

Back to top of section 6

6.3 Legal and Business Transfers 

We may also disclose your personal information if we are required to do so by law, or if in our good faith judgment, such action is reasonably necessary to comply with legal processes, to respond to any claims, or to protect the safety or rights of Nestlé, its customers, or the public. 

In the event of a merger or acquisition of all or part of Nestlé by another company, or in the event that Nestlé were to sell or dispose of all or a part of the Nestlé business, the acquirer would have access to the information maintained by that Nestlé business, which could include personal information. Similarly, personal information may be transferred as part of a corporate reorganization, insolvency proceeding, or other similar event, if permitted by and done in accordance with applicable law. 

Back to top of section 6

6.4 Aggregate Information 

We may share aggregated demographic or survey information with third parties, but this information is in anonymous form and does not contain any personal information. The aggregate information that we share may include anonymous information that is captured through the use of cookies and other similar tracking technology, as explained in the Question 8 below.

We also use information captured in log file for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve and customize the online services we provide you. Log files are used internally only, and are not associated with any particular user. 

Back to top of section 8

8.4 Web Beacons 

We may use web beacons (or clear GIFs) on our websites or include them in the e-mail messages we send you. Web beacons (also known as “web bugs”) are small strings of code that provide a method of delivering a graphic image on a web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring data back to us. The information collected via web beacons may include some of the information described in the IP Address section directly above, as well as information about how a user responds to an email campaign (e.g., the time the email is opened, where does the user link to from the email, etc.). We use web beacon information for a variety of purposes, including but not limited to, site traffic reporting, unique visitor counts, advertising and email auditing and reporting, and personalisation.

### 9\. E Marketing - What is spamming and what is our position on spam e-mails?

Spamming is where unsolicited e-mails are sent to you containing advertisements or marketing related materials without your consent. 

We do NOT send spam e-mails. We use an anti-spam tool to protect our employees from spamming. Sending e-mails without consent is illegal in many countries. We will not use your personal information (including your e-mail address) for direct marketing or follow-up communications unless you give us your EXPRESS permission. This is called "OPT-IN" consent. 

Also, we do not share your personal information with any third party who will use your personal information for spam mails. 

Nestlé websites give you the opportunity to receive marketing information by e-mail. Every e-mail sent by Nestlé will give you the opportunity at any time to stop receiving marketing e-mails 

If for some reason you believe you have received spam e-mail from a Nestlé Group company please [Contact Us](https://www.purina.co.uk/contact-us) immediately.

This means that we may retain your personal information for a reasonable period after you stop using Nestlé services or stop using this website or application. After this period, your personal information will be deleted from all systems in the Nestlé Group.

### 11\. Do we collect personal information from children?

We believe that it is highly important to protect the privacy of children on–line and encourage parents or guardians to spend time on–line with their children to participate in and monitor their e–activities. 

We do not intentionally collect personal information from children under the age of 16 except on some of our children's websites. On these websites, we will collect such personal information in accordance with all local laws and regulations applicable to the privacy rights of children. If parents or guardians provide consent for the child to submit personal information, we will ask children only for the personal information necessary to participate in the program for which the child is registering. 

#### Children specific Websites

Special note to Children under the age of 16: 

If you are under the age of 16, we advise that you speak with your parent or guardian BEFORE giving your personal information to Nestlé websites. If you are not sure you understand something in this section, you should ask your parent or guardian for their help. 

Special note to Parents of Children under the age of 16:

We recommend that parents/guardians regularly check and monitor their children's use of e–mail and other on–line activities. 

Please make sure that your child does not give us personally identifiable information on–line without asking your permission. 

All visitors under the age of 16 will be asked to supply a parent or guardian's e–mail address. This is so that we can forward to parents or guardians a copy of every e–mail we are requested to send to children. 

You can, at any point of time, check your child's personal information and have it changed or deleted on–line. Alternatively, you can also ask us to delete any of your child's information by sending us a deletion request form by e–mail/postal mail/ fax to the address given in contact details set out in Question 13
