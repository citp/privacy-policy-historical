###### Q8. E Marketing - What is SPAMMING and what is Nestlé's position on SPAM e–mails?

Spamming is where unsolicited e–mails are sent to you containing advertisements or marketing related materials without your consent.

Nestlé does **NOT** send SPAM e–mails. Nestlé itself uses an anti–SPAM tool to protect our employees from SPAMMING. Sending e–mails without consent is illegal in many countries. Nestlé will not use your personal information (including your e–mail address) for direct marketing or follow–up communications unless you give us your **EXPRESS** permission. This is called "OPT–IN" consent.

Also, Nestlé does not share your personal information with any Third Party companies who will use your personal information for SPAM mails.

Nestlé websites give you the opportunity to receive marketing information by e–mail. Every e–mail sent by Nestlé will give you the opportunity at any time to stop receiving marketing e–mails.

If for some reason you believe you have received SPAM e–mail from a Nestlé Group company, please inform us immediately at the address given. For address details please see Question 5 \- _How can you see, check, change or delete the Personal Information you send to us?_

Nestlé may store the personal information that you send to us via this website in its databases such as its Customer Relationship Marketing database. Your personal information will be kept by the Nestlé Group only for as long as is reasonably necessary taking into consideration our need to answer queries or resolve problems, provide improved and new services and comply with legal requirements under applicable law(s). This means that we may retain your personal information for a reasonable period after you stop using Nestlé services or stop using this website. After this period, your personal information will be deleted from all systems in the Nestlé Group.

We remind you that we have a right to have your personal information deleted at any time. Please see Question 5 \- How can you see, check, change or delete the Personal Information you send to us (above)?

###### Q10. What is Nestlé's policy on children using and communicating with our websites?

We believe that it is highly important to protect the privacy of children on–line and encourage parents or guardians to spend time on–line with their children to participate in and monitor their e–activities.

We do not intentionally collect personal information from children under the age of 16 except on some of our children's websites. On these websites, we will collect such personal information in accordance with all local laws and regulations applicable to the privacy rights of children. If parents or guardians provide consent for the child to submit personal information, we will ask children only for the personal information necessary to participate in the program for which the child is registering.

###### Children specific Websites

###### Special note to Children under the age of 16

If you are under the age of 16, we advise that you speak with your parent or guardian BEFORE giving your personal information to Nestlé websites. If you are not sure you understand something in this section, you should ask your parent or guardian for their help.

###### Special note to Parents of Children under the age of 16 

We recommend that parents/guardians regularly check and monitor their children's use of e–mail and other on–line activities.

Please make sure that your child does not give us personally identifiable information on–line without asking your permission.

All visitors under the age of 16 will be asked to supply a parent or guardian's e–mail address. This is so that we can forward to parents or guardians a copy of every e–mail we are requested to send to children.

You can, at any point of time, check your child's personal information and have it changed or deleted on–line. Alternatively, you can also ask us to delete any of your child's information by sending us a deletion request form by e–mail/postal mail/ fax to the address given in contact details set out in Question 5 \- _How can you see, check, change or delete the personal information you send to us?_

###### Q11. Does Nestlé link to other Third Party websites and what happens to my personal information when this linking happens?

Nestlé links to other websites to offer you an opportunity to review connected and interesting information related to Nestlé. These Third Party websites are outside of our control and are not covered by this Privacy Notice. If you access other websites using the links provided, the operators of these websites may collect your personal information. Please ensure that you are satisfied with the Privacy Policies of these Third Party websites before you submit any personal information.
