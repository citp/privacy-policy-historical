# Privacy Policy | PureCars

**Last Updated: July 18, 2019**

The website PureCars.com, including all resources available from the PureCars.com domain name (the “Site”) is owned and operated by PureCars Technologies, LLC doing business as PureCars (“PureCars”). This Privacy Policy (the “Statement”) describes the Site’s collection, disclosure, and use of consumer information practices in connection with the Site. The Statement applies to any portions of the Site that PureCars co-brands with any affiliates, licensors, suppliers, service providers, distribution partners, advertisers, and/or other third-parties (collectively, “Affiliates”). Please be aware you may have arrived at a co-branded version of the Site from an Affiliate’s website. This Statement is to be read and understood in conjunction with the [Terms of Service Agreement](https://purecars.com/terms-service-agreement/). Although this Statement will describe how consumer information is shared with Affiliates, who may independently collect, store, and use information obtained from you, this Statement should not be interpreted as making any representations regarding how the Affiliates treat such information. For information on the collection, use, and disclosure practices of Affiliates, please review the privacy policies of those Affiliates.

**Contact Information**

Consumers who visit the Site for personal use (“consumer” or “you” or “your”) will not receive unsolicited emails (“spam”), phone calls, or mailings from PureCars. You may be asked to provide contact information (email, phone, and/or mailing address) through the Site in order to connect you (a “Request”) with a clearly identified seller of a vehicle or automotive product or service (“Seller”). PureCars will deliver your contact information to Seller in connection with a Request and PureCars will not share such information with any other party. Upon the Seller’s request, PureCars may send you a single automated response to your Request. To opt-out from Seller communications, please contact the Seller directly. To the extent an Affiliate manages certain channels of communications (e.g., toll-free telephone numbers), the Affiliates is under an obligation to not use your contact information for any purpose beyond an accounting between Affiliate, PureCars and Seller.

**Consumer Nonpublic Personal Information**

PureCars treats consumer nonpublic personal information (“NPI”) with utmost respect. PureCars warrants that: (1) it guards NPI with physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards; (2) it does not disclose NPI, except as is reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which such information was provided, and (3) it complies with all requirements of Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, 15 U.S.C §§ 6801 through 6810 (“GLB Act”), and the Federal Trade Commission’s implementing regulation, Regulation P, 16 C.F.R. Part 313 (“Regulation P”) as both relate to the disclosure and protection of NPI. PureCars expressly reserves the right to release any NPI under the following circumstances: (a) in connection with any transfer of ownership and/or sale of all or a part of the Site, (b) to protect the property or safety of users of the Site and/or others, (c) to investigate and/or take action against illegal activity, unauthorized use, and/or suspected abuse on or of the Site, (d) to enforce the Terms of Service Agreement, and (e) when required by legal process or law.

**Passive Information Collection**

The Site automatically collects non-personally identifiable information, which may include the type and version of your browser, your service provider, your IP address, location-based information, your usage and navigation of the Site, and any means you may have used to locate the Site (“Web Analytics”). Web Analytics does NOT include your name, e-mail, telephone number or other information described in the “Contact Information” section of this Statement. Web Analytics may be collected through cookies, web beacons, or other technologies.

**Use of Information**

PureCars may use any collected information to help diagnose problems with equipment, administer and operate the Site, compile statistical data for analysis, research, optimization, performance and development. Additionally, PureCars may use collected information to manage interest-based advertisements on behalf of its Affiliates. To opt-out from interest-based advertisements, you can visit the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/).

PureCars will not, in the ordinary course of business, release, publish, or disseminate the content of private electronic messages transmitted to PureCars. However, we may occasionally release information concerning such communications when release is appropriate to comply with law (including disclosure in response to a request from a law enforcement agency), or to protect the rights, property, or safety of visitors to the Site, PureCars, Affiliates, and/or others.
