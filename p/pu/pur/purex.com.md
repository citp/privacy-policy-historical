## 7\. Data Sharing and Storage

Henkel may disclose your information to third parties to the extent not inconsistent with this Privacy Statement or other written statements made by Us at the time of collection, and not prohibited by applicable law, including without limitation as follows:

  * Henkel’s agents, vendors, consultants, and other service providers (collectively **“Service Providers”** ) may receive, or be given access to your information, including, without limitation, Henkel-Collected-PI and other Personal Information, Demographic Information, and Usage Information, in connection with their work on Henkel’s behalf, provided however, Henkel does not authorize its Service Providers to use Henkel-Collected-PI to send you direct marketing messages other than related to Henkel and Henkel Affiliates absent your consent. For more information on choices Service Providers may offer you see Section 11.
  * We reserve the right to release your Henkel-Collected-PI and other Personal Information if required to do so by law, search warrant, subpoena, court order or upon request of government authorities.
  * We may provide your Henkel-Collected-PI and other Personal Information, and other information, to third parties in connection with the reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or any portion of Our business, assets, or stock, including any such activities associated with a bankruptcy or similar proceeding.
  * Henkel may share your Personal Information with its affiliated companies and subsidiaries (“ **Affiliates** ”), and other third parties, some of which may be located outside of the United States, for marketing and other business activities, subject to certain rights of residents of California and Connecticut  [see Section 12].



Your Personal Information may be stored for a reasonable amount of time in Henkel databases, some of which are located outside of the United States and Canada, and will be automatically transferred to these databases for storage and maintenance. The Service is based in the U.S., intended for residents of the U.S. and Canada and for persons outside Canada, the information Henkel and its Service Providers collect via the Service is governed by U.S. law. If you are accessing the Service from outside of the U.S., please be aware that information collected through the Service may be transferred to, processed, stored, and used in the U.S. Data protection laws in the U.S. may be different from those of your country of residence and provide a lower level of consumer protection, and information transferred to the U.S. may be accessed by U.S. governments and law enforcement in accordance with U.S. laws. Your use of the Service, or provision of any information via the Service, therefore constitutes your consent to the transfer to and from, processing, usage, sharing, and storage of your information, including Personal Information, in the U.S. as set forth in this Privacy Statement.

## 8.  Third-Party Content, Third-Party Services, Social Features, Advertising and Analytics

The Service may include hyperlinks to, or include on or in connection with, the Service (e.g., apps and plug-ins), websites, locations, platforms, applications or services operated by third parties (“ **Third-Party Service ‏(s**)”). These Third-Party Services may use their own cookies, web beacons, and other Tracking Technologies to independently collect information about you and may solicit Personal Information from you.  Henkel is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of the Third-Party Services. Please note that the privacy statements applicable to such Third-Party Services may differ significantly from the Henkel Privacy Statement, so We advise you to read them carefully before using those services. You agree that Henkel shall not be held liable for any actions by or content of such Third-Party Services.

Certain functionalities on the Service permit interactions that you initiate between the Service and certain Third-Party Services, such as third party social networks ( **“Social Features”** ).  Examples of Social Features include: enabling you to send content such as contacts and photos between the Service and a Third-Party Service; “liking” or “sharing” Henkel’s content; logging in to the Service using your Third-Party Service account (e.g., using Facebook Connect to sign-in to the Service); and to otherwise connect the Service to a Third-Party Service (e.g., to pull or push information to or from the Service).  If you use Social Features, and potentially other Third-Party Services, information you post or provide access to may be publicly displayed on the Service (see Section 5) or by the Third-Party Service that you use. Similarly, if you post information on a third-party service that references the Service ( _e.g._ , by using a hashtag associated with Henkel or other Henkel Affiliates in a tweet or status update), you agree that your post may be used on or in connection with the Service or otherwise by Henkel or other Henkel Affiliates. Also, both Henkel and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of the Service and any Third-Party Service.

Henkel may engage and work with Service Providers and other third parties to serve advertisements on the Service and/or on third-party services.  Some of these ads may be tailored to your interest based on your browsing of the Service and elsewhere on the internet, sometimes referred to as “interest-based advertising” and “online behavioral advertising” (“ **Interest-based Advertising** ”), which may include sending you an ad on a Third-Party Service after you have left the Service (i.e., “retargeting”).  As an example, the Service may employ a “DoubleClick id-Cookie,” which may assign a pseudonymized identifier to, among other things, track DoubleClick advertising. DoubleClick is a service provided by Google. For information on your ability to opt-out of Interest-based Advertising see section 11 below.

Henkel may use Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics or other Service Providers for analytics services.  These analytics services may use cookies and other Tracking Technologies to help Henkel analyze Service users and how they use the Service.  Information generated by these services ( _e.g._ , your IP address and other Usage Information) may be transmitted to and stored by these Service Providers on servers in the U.S. (or elsewhere) and these Service Providers may use this information for purposes such as evaluating your use of the Service, compiling statistic reports on the Service’s activity, and providing other services relating to Service activity and other Internet usage. 

Except to the extent We combine information We receive from Service Providers, Third-Party Services, or other third parties with Henkel-Collected PI, in which case Henkel will treat the combined information as Henkel-Collected PI under this Privacy Statement, data obtained by Henkel from a third party, even in association with the Service, is not subject to Henkel’s limitations regarding Henkel-Collected PI under this Privacy Statement, however such data remains subject to any restrictions imposed on Henkel by the third party, if any.  Otherwise, the information collected, stored, and shared by third parties remains subject to their privacy policies and practices, including whether they continue to share information with Henkel, the types of information shared, and your choices on what is visible to others on Third-Party Services.    

Henkel is not responsible for and makes no representations regarding the policies or business practices of any third parties, including, without limitation, analytics Service Providers and Third-Party Services associated with the Service, and encourages you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use.  See Section 11 for more on certain choices offered by some third parties regarding their data collection and use, including regarding Interest-based Advertising and analytics.

## 9\. Security and Monitoring  


Henkel will take reasonable precautions to protect your Personal Information ‏(excluding public UGC) from loss, misuse or alteration.  Personal Information may be accessed by persons within Our organization, or Our third party service providers, who require such access to carry out the purposes indicated above, or such other purposes as may be permitted or required by the applicable law. Please be aware, however, that any email or other transmission you send through the Internet cannot be completely protected against unauthorized interception and that the internet and online digital storage are not completely secure and We do not guarantee the security of your information collected through the Service.

To help protect you and others, We and Our Service Providers may (but make no commitment to) monitor use of the Service, and may collect and use related information including Henkel-Collected PI and other Personal Information for all purposes not prohibited by applicable law or inconsistent with this Privacy Statement, including, without limitation, to identify fraudulent activities and transactions; prevent abuse of and investigate and/or seek prosecution for any potential threats to or misuse of the Service; ensure compliance with the [Terms of Use](https://www.henkel-northamerica.com/terms-of-use-na?view=content-blank) and this Privacy Statement; investigate violations of or enforce these agreements; and otherwise to protect the rights and property of Henkel, our Affiliates third parties, and other users.  Monitoring may result in the collection, recording, and analysis of online activity or communications through Our Service.  If you do not consent to these conditions, you must discontinue your use of the Service.

## 10\. Children  


The Service is intended for a general audience and not directed to children less than 13 years of age. Henkel does not intend to collect personal information as defined by the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act ( **“COPPA”** ) ( **“Children’s Personal Information”** ) in a manner that is not permitted by COPPA. If We obtain knowledge that We have collected Children’s Personal Information in a manner not permitted by COPPA or other applicable law, We will remove such data to the extent required by COPPA or such other applicable law.  
Any California residents under the age of eighteen (18) who have registered to use the Service, and who posted content or information on the Service, can request removal by contacting Henkel [here](https://web.archive.org/contact-us) detailing where the content or information is posted and attesting that you posted it. Henkel will then make reasonable good faith efforts to remove the post from prospective public view or anonymize it so the minor cannot be individually identified to the extent required by applicable law. This removal process cannot ensure complete or comprehensive removal. For instance, third-parties may have republished or archived content by search engines and others that Henkel does not control.

## 11\. Your Choices Regarding Your Personal Information

### A. Tracking Technologies Generally

Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some instances blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Browsers offer different functionalities and options so you may need to set them separately. Also, tools from commercial browsers may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies (also known as locally shared objects), HTML5 cookies, or other Tracking Technologies. For information on disabling Flash cookies, go to Adobe’s website <http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-third-party-local-shared.html>. Please be aware that if you disable or remove these technologies, some parts of the Service may not work and that when you revisit the Service your ability to limit browser-based Tracking Technologies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.  


Some App-related Tracking Technologies in connection with non-browser usage (e.g., most functionality of a mobile app) can only be disabled by uninstalling the app. To uninstall an app, follow the instructions from your operating system or handset manufacturer.  


Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no consensus among industry participants as to what “Do Not Track” means in this context. Like many online services, Henkel currently does not alter Henkel’s practices when Henkel receives a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” you can visit [http://www.allaboutdnt.com](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/), but We are not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this third party information. Some third parties, however, may offer you choices regarding their Tracking Technologies. One way to potentially identify cookies on Our Site is to add the free Ghostery plug-in to your browser ([www.ghostery.com](http://www.ghostery.com/)), which according to Ghostery will display for you traditional, browser-based cookies associated with the web sites (but not mobile apps) you visit and privacy and opt-out policies and options of the parties operating those cookies. Henkel is not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this tool or third party choice notices or mechanisms. For specific information on some of the choice options offered by third party analytics and advertising providers, see the next section.

### B. Analytics and Advertising Tracking Technologies

You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Google Analytics by going to <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout> or downloading the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Adobe Analytics by going to <http://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html> under the section labeled “Tell Our customers not to measure your use of their websites or tailor their online ads for you.” You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Google DoubleClick by going to [http://www.google.com/settings/ads?hl=en&sig=ACi0TCgXcUy18Z6Kz1pyakm7pX-B1M877ZOZM4fyhX3MaQy-Iki2ybWNEgma-KMfvA7dEIUaKxnTeqojTguFHK3SeHycKTZ1Ew](http://www.google.com/settings/ads?hl=en&sig=ACi0TCgXcUy18Z6Kz1pyakm7pX-B1M877ZOZM4fyhX3MaQy-Iki2ybWNEgma-KMfvA7dEIUaKxnTeqojTguFHK3SeHycKTZ1Ew). Henkel is not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.  


You may choose whether to receive some Interest-based Advertising by submitting opt-outs to industry programs. Some of the advertisers and Service Providers that perform advertising-related services for Us and third parties may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance’s ( **“DAA”** ) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based Advertising, visit [http://www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/), and <http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices> for information on the DAA’s opt-out program for mobile apps. Some of these companies may also be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their members, see <http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/>. Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads. Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver certain Interest-based Advertising to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). Some companies also provide a specific opportunity to opt-out. For information on the Interest-based Advertising choices offered by DoubleClick, see [here](https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads/plugin?hl=en&sig=ACi0TCigvVYAN17ugYRMwQf_InKv4i5GKLPNen5UUD8qFqiWU4vtXR5jsz_uaOHdJqvhufEjezDh-Q13icRRRab9WJDGpQbwkQ). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit these opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use of a different device or web browsers or use a non-browser-based method of access (e.g., mobile app), your browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. Henkel supports the ad industry’s [2009 Self-regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising](http://www.iab.net/media/file/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf) and expects that ad networks Henkel directly engages to serve you Interest-based Advertising will do so as well, though Henkel cannot guaranty their compliance. Henkel is not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.

### C. Mobile Apps

With respect to Henkel’s mobile apps ‏(“apps”), you can stop all collection of data generated by use of the app by uninstalling the app.  Also, you may be able to exercise specific privacy choices, such as enabling or disabling certain features ‏(e.g., location-based services, push notifications, accessing calendar/contacts/phots, etc.), by adjusting the permissions in your mobile device and/or the app’s settings. Beware that if GPS precise location services are disabled, other means of establishing or estimating location ‏(e.g., connecting to or proximity to wi-fi, Bluetooth, beacons, or Our networks) may persist.  See also the prior section regarding the DAA’s mobile Interest-based Advertising choices.
