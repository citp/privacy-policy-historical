<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="tip"><em>Last Updated: Wednesday 6th August 2008</em></p>
<p>
  This Privacy Policy (the "<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>") explains how and for what purposes we use the information we
  collect about you via our website www.puresolo.com (the "<strong>Site</strong>") . Please read this Privacy Policy
  carefully. By using the Site and the Service we offer via the Site, you are agreeing to be bound by this Privacy
  Policy.
</p>
<p>
  In this Privacy Policy, words defined in the Pure Solo Terms of Use ("<a href="/pages/terms_and_conditions"><strong>Terms of Use</strong></a>") have the same meaning.
</p>
<p>
  For the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998 (the <strong>"Act" </strong>), the 
  data controller is Pure Solo Limited, incorporated in England and Wales with registration
  number 06107958 , whose registered office is at 83 Baker Street, London W1U 6AG, England 
  ("<strong>Pure Solo</strong>" or "<strong>we</strong>").
</p>

<h3>INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT FROM YOU</h3>
<p>
  We may collect and process the following information about you ("<strong>Personal Data</strong>"):
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    information that you provide by filling in forms on the Site. This includes information about you (and your
    parent or guardian, if you are under 16) which you provide when registering to use the Site, posting material or
    requesting further services. We may also ask you for information when you enter a competition, prize draw or
    other contest sponsored by Pure Solo, enter a promotion, and when you report a problem with the Site;
  </li>
  <li>if you contact us, we may keep a record of that
  correspondence;</li>
  <li>
    we may ask you to complete surveys that we use for research purposes, although you do not have to respond to
    them;
  </li>
  <li>details of transactions you carry out through the
  Site and of the fulfillment of your orders;</li>
  <li>
    details of your visits to the Site including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other
    communication data, whether this is required for our own billing purposes or otherwise and the resources that
    you access;
  </li>
  <li>
  the Software may collect and send information about each of your sessions to help us identify issues, evaluate
  how the Software is used and provide the Service. Such information may include: the software version
  number and unique identifier numbers that allow us to distinguish between different computers and different
  people using the Software; your username or company ID; the duration of your session; and the number of times
  you download any Content; </li>
  <li>
    the Software may collect and send additional information to help us better understand your music preferences,
    personalize certain content, recommend music to purchase or listen to, share playlists, and to automatically
    identify what CD is in your computer; such information may include the song playing, your playlists and what CD
    is in your drive;
  </li>
  <li>
    audio tracks that you buy from the Site or using the Software may contain security systems, known as digital
    rights management (or "DRM"), which may track and send to us over the Internet play counts and other
    information to assist in providing the Service.</li>
  <li>
    we may ask you to provide a testimonial regarding your experience of the Service; you are free to do so or not,
    but if we wish to publish your testimonial on the Site (which may include information identifying you personally
    such as your name), we will obtain your permission before doing so.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>IP ADDRESSES AND COOKIES</h3>
<p>
  We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and
  browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. This is
  statistical data about our users’ browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.
</p>
<p>
  For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general Internet usage by using a cookie file which is
  stored on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer's hard
  drive. They help us to improve the Site and to deliver a better and more personalised service. They also enable
  us:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    to estimate our audience size and usage pattern and to monitor and improve the Site and the Service;
  </li>
  <li>
    to store information about your preferences, and so allow us to customise the Site according to your individual
    interests;
  </li>
  <li>to speed up your searches; and</li> <li>to recognise you when you return to the Site. </li>
</ul>
<p>
  You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting
  of cookies. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of the Site or
  functionality of the Software. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our
  system will issue cookies when you log on to the Site.
</p>
<p>
  Please note that our advertisers may also use cookies, over which we have no control.<a></a> We may allow certain
  other companies, through the Site, to set and access their cookies on your computer. Those companies
  provide, among other services, auditing, research and reporting for advertisers. The collection and use of
  your personal information by these companies will be subject to the terms set by these companies, and not subject
  to this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<h3>WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h3>
<p>
  The Personal Data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the
  European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for
  one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfillment of your order, the
  processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you
  agree to this transfer, storing or processing. Countries outside the EEA may not provide the same level of legal
  protection for personal data as that found inside the EEA (including under the Act). However, we will take all
  steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy
  Policy.
</p>
<p>
  All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted
  using SSL technology. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access
  certain parts of the Site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a
  password with anyone.
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our
  best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the Site; any
  transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and
  security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.<a></a>

    if you are a new customer, we (or selected third parties) may contact you by electronic means (e-mail or
