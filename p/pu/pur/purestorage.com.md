This Privacy Statement applies to Pure websites and Solutions that link to or reference this Statement and describes how we handle personal information and the choices available to you regarding collection, use, access, and how to update and correct your personal information. Additional information on our personal information practices may be provided in offer descriptions, supplemental privacy statements, or notices provided prior to or at the time of data collection. Certain Pure websites may have their own privacy statement that describes how we handle personal information for those websites specifically. To the extent a notice provided at the time of collection or a website or Solution specific privacy statement conflict with this Privacy Statement, such specific notice or supplemental privacy statement will control.

**Collecting Your Personal Information**

Pure may collect data, including personal information, about you as you use our websites and Solutions and interact with us. "Personal information" is any information that can be used to identify an individual, and may include name, address, email address, phone number, login information (account number, password), marketing preferences, social media account information, or payment card number. If we link other data with your personal information, we will treat that linked data as personal information. We also collect personal information from trusted third-party sources and engage third parties to collect personal information to assist us.

Pure collects personal information for a variety of reasons, such as:

·       Providing customer service

·       Providing you with a newsletter subscription

·       When a computer-based certification test is administered to you

Pure and the third parties we engage with may combine the information we collect from you over time and across our websites and Solutions with information obtained from other sources. This helps us improve its overall accuracy and completeness, and also helps us better tailor our interactions with you.

If you choose to provide Pure with a third party's personal information (such as name, email, and phone number), you represent that you have the third party's permission to do so. Examples include forwarding reference or marketing material to a friend or sending job referrals. Third parties may unsubscribe from any future communication following the link provided in the initial message or contacting [purestorage@purestorage.com](mailto:purestorage@purestorage.com).

In some instances, Pure and the third parties we engage may automatically collect data through cookies, web logs, web beacons, and other similar applications. This information is used to better understand and improve the usability, performance, and effectiveness of the website and to help tailor content or offers for you. Please read the "Cookies and Web Technologies" section below for more information.

If you need additional assistance, or help with accessing, correcting, suppressing, or deleting your personal information, please feel free to contact us directly.

Pure implements physical, administrative, and technical safeguards designed to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We also contractually require that our suppliers protect such information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure. The Internet, however, cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any personal information you provide to us.

**Retention of Personal Information**

We will retain your personal information as needed to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected. We will retain and use your personal information as necessary to comply with our business requirements, legal obligations, resolve disputes, protect our assets, and enforce our agreements.

**Use of Cookies and Web Technologies**

Like many websites, Pure uses automatic data collection tools, such as cookies, embedded web links, and web beacons. These tools collect certain standard information that your browser sends to our website such as your browser type and the address of the website from which you arrived at our website. They may also collect information about:

·       Your Internet Protocol (IP) address. This is a number automatically assigned to your computer or device whenever you are connecting to the Internet. It allows web servers to locate and identify your device, this is a unique address assigned to your device by your Internet service provider or information systems department on a TCP/IP network.

·       Clickstream behavior. For example, the pages you view and the links you click.

·       These tools help make your visit to our website easier, more efficient, and more valuable by providing you with a customized experience and recognizing you when you return.

The Pure website includes widgets, which are interactive mini-programs that run on our site to provide specific services from another company (such as displaying the news, opinions, music, and more). Personal information, such as your email address, may be collected through such widgets. Cookies may also be set by widgets to enable it to function properly. Information collected by widgets is governed by the privacy policy of the company that created the widget.

Some web browsers may give you the ability to enable a "do not track" feature that sends signals to the websites you visit, indicating that you do not want your online activities tracked. This is different than blocking or deleting cookies, as browsers with a "do not track" feature enabled may still accept cookies. There is currently no industry standard for how companies should respond to "do not track" signals, although one may develop in the future. Our websites do not recognize and respond to "do not track" signals at this time. If we do so in the future, we will describe how in this Privacy Statement.

Pure partners with third parties to either display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partners may use cookies or similar technologies in order to provide you with advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to opt-out of interest-based advertising, please email [purestorage@purestorage.com](mailto:purestorage@purestorage.com).  Please note, generic, non-personalized ads will continue to be displayed.

**Linked Websites**

We may provide links to other third-party websites and services that are outside our control and not covered by this Privacy Statement. We encourage you to review the privacy statements posted on those websites (and all websites) you visit.

**Forums and Chat Rooms**

If you participate in a discussion forum, local communities, or chat room on a Pure website, you should be aware that the information you provide there (i.e. your public profile) may be made broadly available to others, and could be used to contact you, send you unsolicited messages, or for purposes neither Pure nor you have control over. Also, please recognize that individual forums and chat rooms may have additional rules and conditions. Pure is not responsible for the personal information or any other information you choose to submit in these forums. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at [community@purestorage.com](mailto:community@purestorage.com).  In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

**Children's Privacy**

Pure encourages parents and guardians to take an active role in their children's online activities. Pure does not knowingly collect personal information from children without appropriate parental or guardian consent. If you believe that we may have collected personal information from someone under the applicable age of consent in your country without proper consent, please let us know by emailing [privacy@purestorage.com](mailto:privacy@purestorage.com), and we will take appropriate measures to investigate and address the issue promptly.

**Consent to Transfer, Processing and Storage of Personal Information**

As Pure is a global organization, we may transfer your personal information to Pure in the United States of America, to any Pure subsidiary worldwide, or to third parties and business partners as described above that are located in various countries around the world. By using our websites and Solutions or providing any personal information to us, where applicable law permits, you consent to the transfer, processing, and storage of such information outside of your country of residence where data protection standards may be different.

**Your California Privacy Rights**

Residents of the State of California, under California Civil Code § 1798.83, have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed personal information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that gives either an opt-out or opt-in choice for use of your personal information by third parties (such as advertisers) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options.

Pure qualifies for the alternative option. We have a comprehensive privacy statement, and provide you with details on how you may either opt-out or opt-in to the use of your personal information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your personal information for marketing purposes during the preceding year.

If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices, please email us your request at [privacy@purestorage.com](mailto:privacy@purestorage.com).

**How to Contact Us**

We value your opinions. Should you have questions or comments related to this Privacy Statement, please email [privacy@purestorage.com](mailto:privacy@purestorage.com).

We may update this Privacy Statement from time to time. If we modify our Privacy Statement, we will post the revised version here, with an updated revision date. You agree to visit these pages every now and then to be aware of and review any such revisions. If we make material changes to our Privacy Statement, we may also notify you by other means prior to the changes taking effect, such as by posting a notice on our websites or sending you a notification.
