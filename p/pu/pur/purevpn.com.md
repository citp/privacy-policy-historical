# PureVPN’s Privacy Policy

We do NOT keep any logs that can identify or help in monitoring a user’s activity.

## You are Invisible – Even We Cannot See What You Do Online

We Do Not monitor user activity nor do we keep any logs. We therefore have no record of your activities such as which software you used, which websites you visited, what content you downloaded, which apps you used, etc. after you connected to any of our servers. Our servers automatically record the time at which you connect to any of our servers. From here on forward, we do not keep any records of anything that could associate any specific activity to a specific user. The time when a successful connection is made with our servers is counted as a “connection” and the total bandwidth used during this connection is called “bandwidth”. Connection and bandwidth are kept in record to maintain the quality of our service. This helps us understand the flow of traffic to specific servers so we could optimize them better.

  


## The Information We Collect

Personally Identifiable Information (PII) includes all such information which can be directly linked to an individual e.g. Name, telephone number or email address.

This information may include, but not limited to:

  * Names (For account creation purpose)
  * Email address (For the creation of an account and/or to contact you with offers and discounts)
  * Phone number (For particular users from certain countries ONLY)



> There are "No Mandatory Data Retention Laws" in Hong Kong.

  


## How This Information is Used

PII is used by PureVPN to better understand your needs and interests, personalize communications, improve services and ensure quality experience for users of the PureVPN website and services. This information may be used to:

  * Resend your login credentials in case you forget or lose them
  * Update you about change in any policies
  * Any relevant developments in the VPN industry
  * Let you know about discount offers and packages

  


## We Aren't Cookie Monsters

We use browser cookies on this web site just like many other organizations to improve the quality of our service. One or more cookies are sent that uniquely identifies your browser. These cookies are used to ensure everyone who uses our website has the best possible experience.

  


## Your Information Is In Safe Hands!

PureVPN does not share, sell or rent your personal information with anyone apart from using your information to provide products or services you've requested for.

> PureVPN acknowledges and respects your privacy. PureVPN will hold every bit of information provided by you with maximum care and will never use it in ways that you have not consented to.

  


## Be Nice – Play Nice

If in the course of normal business (including complaints from the general public) we discover that you have violated our Terms of Service Agreement, we may terminate your account and optionally refund the balance of your account to you.

> Even in such a scenario, we will remain committed to not disclose/monitor your activities. 

  


## Information Sharing and Disclosure

> PureVPN specifically chose Hong Kong (HK) for its headquarter because there are "No Mandatory Data Retention Laws" in Hong Kong

We are therefore, not legally obliged to store user data and share it with anyone. Since PureVPN is committed to freedom, and doesn't support crime, we will only share information with authorities having valid subpoenas, warrants, other legal documents or with alleged victims having clear proof of any such activity. It goes without saying that we will only do so in the best interest of our customers and our company. When and if a competent court of law orders us or an alleged victim requests us (that we rigorously self-assess) to release some information, with proper evidence, that our services were used for any activity that you agreed not to indulge in when you agreed to our Terms of Service Agreement, then we will only present specific information about that specific activity only, provided we have the record of any such activity.

  


## Payments and Individual Accounts

Similar to every other ecommerce or online business, PureVPN too uses third-party payment processors.We have ensured, to the best of our ability, that the third-party payment processors have trusted security systems to safeguard our user data. However, we claim no responsibility for how they handle your data.

To further ensure your security, our servers do not keep complete information of any user, and we delete the information of users immediately after they decide not to use our services. The data that we do keep is strictly for accounting purposes, and prevent fraud now and in the future.

Since we are huge believers in anonymity, we have included Bitcoin and Gift Cards – 100% anonymous payment methods – in the payment methods accepted by us.

Your Payment Information data is only kept for as long as you are using our services, and in some instances, for a period of two years after that. This is done to comply with any legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

  


## We Are Data Superheroes

All PII, public and private keys, passwords are stored in encrypted format, using strong cryptographic algorithms.

> We also allow our users to select their own level of encryption depending on their needs.

Appropriate security measures are taken for the protection of this information against unauthorized access, unauthorized alteration, destruction or disclosure of data. Access to personal information by PureVPN employees, contractors and agents is restricted. These officials require that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services but are bound by confidentiality obligations. They may be subjected to disciplinary action, which includes termination and criminal prosecution, upon failing to meet these obligations.

  


## VPN Service Data Routing

To ensure that our users get blazing-fast speed and seamless connectivity every time they use our services, we use business and commercial logic to direct the interchange from the country of your liking (whereby, country means the location as stated in 3rd party independent IP to location information databases). 

This logic helps us keep our network up and running even during peak traffic hours. To shield our network from reaching its maximum capacity at any given time, and to continue to provide 100% consistency, we at will redirect traffic from your desired datacenter or country to provide you with the next best low latency and high-speed connection. In order to offer 100% for its users, the traffic will be routed to another interchange within the same desired country or if not possible, to the nearest best available country.

File sharing is allowed on the following servers only: Afghanistan, Algeria, Angola, Armenia, The Bahamas, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belgium, Bermuda, Bolivia, British Virgin Islands, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Cape Verde, Cayman Islands, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Denmark, Dominicia, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Estonia, Ethiopia, Germany, Ghana, Gernada, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Latvia, Lebanon, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macao, Madagascar, Mauritiania, Mauritius, Moldova, Monaco, Mongolia, Montserrat, Myanmar, Netherlands, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Peru, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Romania, Russia, Saint Lucia, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Serbia, Seychelles, Slovenia, Sri Lanka, Suriname, Sweden, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Turks and Caicos Islands, United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan and Venezuela.
