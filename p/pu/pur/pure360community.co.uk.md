Our policy is both specific and strict. If you think our policy falls short of your expectations or that we are failing to abide by our policy, please let us know.

In extreme cases data provided by you may be unlawfully available to hackers and snoopers, unfortunately we are unable to accept responsibility for this. The risk is no different from a similar risk of burglary , in a bricks and mortar establishment you can lock the doors but they may still find a way in. Except as set out below, we do not share, or sell, or disclose to a third party, any personally identifiable information collected at this site. If this policy should change in the future, then we will provide notification in advance and users have the opportunity to indicate whether or not they would prefer that we do not provide the information to third parties as proposed. 

Here is a list of the information we collect, and why it is necessary to collect it:

## Information supplied by our clients and relating to third parties

Third party information such as names, e-mail addresses and information which relates to the industry or business of a party. This information is used to provide our mail services to our own clients.

We do not use third party information supplied by our clients in any other way. In particular, we do not use it for marketing our own services nor do we disclose it to any other person for any reason.
