                      At Purolator we are committed to protecting your privacy. The purpose of this Privacy Statement is to inform you about Purolator's practices relating to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information that may be provided through access to or use of our websites or shipping services and related products or that may otherwise be collected by us.
                      <b><br>
                      <br>
                      Personal Information</b>
                      <br>
              For the purpose of this Privacy Statement, "personal information" means information about an identifiable individual, but does not include the name, title or business address or telephone number of an employee of an organization.<br>
              <br>
              <b>What Personal Information We Collect and How We Use It</b>
                      <br>
              Purolator collects and retains information about every shipment we make so that we can better provide you with the services and information necessary to make shipping even easier.
              Examples of personal information collected by Purolator are:
              </p><ul>
                        <li> contact information (such as name, address, e-mail address and telephone number in a non-business capacity);</li>
                        <li> proof of identity (such as signature and driver's licence number);</li>
                        <li> financial and billing information (such as credit card details and credit history); and</li>
                        <li> on an optional basis, demographic information (such as age, education and occupation).</li>
              </ul>
                      <p class="Contenttext">Purolator uses your personal information for the following purposes:
                      </p><ul>
                        <li> to provide you with timely and reliable services, including shipping, tracing packages, communicating with you and the intended recipient of your packages about the status of the shipment, customer support, account management and billing, verifying credit, customer authentication and related services;</li>
                        <li> to develop and maintain our relationship with you and to communicate with you;</li>
                        <li> to develop and improve our products, services and websites and to advise you about new products and services that may be of interest to you;</li>
                        <li> to satisfy Purolator's legitimate business interests (for example, conducting market studies and trend analysis and generating aggregate data and reports which record customer behaviour as a whole); and</li>
                        <li> to assist law enforcement agencies, to collect outstanding debts, to protect our business interests and the interests of our customers, and to generally meet requirements imposed by law.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p class="Contenttext"><b>When We Disclose Your Personal Information</b><br>
                      Except with your consent, we will not sell, share, license, trade or rent your personal information to others.
                      Purolator may disclose personal information to third parties engaged to assist us in providing services to you or to carry out one or more of the purposes described above.
                      Purolator reserves the right to co-operate fully with local, provincial, state and federal officials in any investigation relating to any personal information (including private electronic communications transmitted on any Purolator website) or any purported unlawful activities.
                      Purolator reserves the right to disclose and/or transfer personal information to a third party in the event of a proposed or actual sale, merger or other transfer of the assets or shares of Purolator Courier Ltd. or a division thereof, provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the principles expressed in this Privacy Statement and the information does not constitute all or substantially all of the assets being transferred.<br>
                      <br>
                      <b>Knowledge and Consent</b><br>
                      Purolator collects personal information about our customers only when our customers voluntarily provide it.
                      When personal information is provided to us about the intended recipient of a shipment, we use that information solely for the purposes of processing the shipment and, in some cases, to communicate with the intended recipient to provide information pertaining to the status of the shipment. We rely on our customers to obtain the intended recipient's consent to our use of their personal information for these limited purposes.
                      The form of consent provided by an individual, including whether it is express or implied, will largely depend on the sensitivity of the personal information and the reasonable expectations of the individual in the circumstances.
                      You may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. If you wish to withdraw your consent, please contact Purolator at 1-888-280-9557 or <a href="mailto:privacy@purolator.com">privacy@purolator.com</a>. Purolator will inform you of the implications of withdrawing consent.
                      We will not, as a condition of the supply of a product or service, require you to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of information beyond that required to fulfill the explicitly specified and legitimate purposes.

                      Cookies</b>
                      <br>
                      A cookie is a small file containing information that a website creates when you visit it. A cookie can track how and when you use a website and/or other websites which you visited and can store that information.
                      There are two common types of cookies: "session cookies" and "persistent cookies".
                      Session cookies store information only for the length of time that you are connected to a website -- they are not written onto your hard drive. Once you leave the website, the originator of the cookie no longer has the information that was contained on it.
                      Purolator uses session cookies as an additional security feature. When you log on to Purolator Online Shipping and are authenticated through your User ID and password, a cookie will store the identification number of your browser. Throughout your session, the session cookie acts as a type of digital signature to identify your current session to the web server. The web server will monitor the number of your browser to ensure that, at all times during your session, we are dealing with you.
                      Purolator also uses session cookies to track your visits within our website. Purolator uses that information to determine the type of information that you are looking for on our website and to improve our website. Purolator uses information about the site you visited immediately prior to our site to assess the viability of links to our site that we have created on third party sites.
                      The information stored in "persistent cookies" is written onto your hard drive and remains there until the expiry date of the cookie. From time to time, Purolator uses persistent cookies to store non-sensitive personal information that you are aware of and have agreed to.
                      Currently, most browsers do not distinguish between session cookies and persistent cookies. For Purolator Online Shipping to operate, your browser must be set to accept cookies. If you are concerned about having your browser enabled to accept cookies while you are surfing other websites, we recommend that you enable your browser to notify you when it is receiving a cookie. This gives you the ability to accept or reject cookies presented by the web server you are visiting. We suggest you contact the manufacturer of your browser for information on how to do this.

                      <br>
                      How We Protect Your Personal Information</b><br>
                      Purolator makes all commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that personal information collected from you is protected against loss and unauthorized access. Access to your personal information is restricted to selected Purolator employees or representatives. In addition, Purolator employs generally accepted information security techniques, such as firewalls, access control procedures and cryptography, to protect personal information against loss and unauthorized access.
                      While Purolator uses commercially reasonable efforts to limit access to its vehicles and premises to authorized personnel, Purolator cannot guarantee the confidentiality of information that is displayed on any shipment package or shipment label.

                      Purolator retains your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected and to comply with applicable laws.

                      This website may offer links to other websites. You should be aware that operators of linked websites may also collect your personal information (including information generated through the use of cookies) when you link to their websites.
