              <p class="Contenttext">              At Purolator, we are committed to protecting our  customers’ privacy. The purpose of this Privacy Statement is to inform our  customers of Purolator's practices relating to the collection, use and  disclosure of personal information that we may receive in association with our customers’  use of our shipping and related products and services, our customers’ access to  or use of our websites, or other interactions our customers may have with us. </p>

              <p class="Contenttext">"personal information" means  information about an identifiable individual, but does not include the name,  title or business address or telephone number of an employee of an  organization.</p>
              <p class="Contenttext">&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="Contenttext"><strong>What Personal Information We Collect and How We  Use It</strong> <br>
              We collect personal  information about every shipment tendered to Purolator so that we can provide our  customers with the transportation and information services necessary to make  shipping convenient, and bill our customers accurately for the products and services  we provide to them. &nbsp;Examples of the personal  information we collect in relation to shipments  include: </p>
              <ul>
                <li class="Contenttext">contact information (such as name, address,  e-mail address and personal telephone number); </li>

                <li class="Contenttext">financial and billing information (such as  credit card details and credit history).</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="Contenttext">We  use the personal information we collect in relation to shipments so that we can: </p>
              <ul>
                <li class="Contenttext">provide our customers with timely and reliable products  and services, including the pick-up and delivery of shipments, the performance of  logistics services, the arrangement of customs brokerage services, and communication  with our customers about the status of their shipments (including through our online  shipment tracking application, by telephone or by e-mail); </li>
                <li class="Contenttext">bill our customers for the products and services  we provide them, including the verification of their credit, the authentication  of their identities, and the production of detailed invoices that help them  verify the charges billed to them;</li>
                <li class="Contenttext">establish, maintain and develop relationships  with our customers, including the management of their accounts with Purolator;</li>
                <li class="Contenttext">develop, promote and manage our products and services,  including the completion of market studies and the communication of new products  and services, special offers, promotions, and service tips; and </li>

              <p class="Contenttext"><strong>When We Disclose Personal Information</strong><br>
              We may transfer personal information to third parties  engaged to assist us in providing products and services to our customers, &nbsp;to otherwise carry out one or more of the  purposes described above, or to administer our distribution lists.&nbsp; Such third parties may include, among others,  other transportation companies or local pick-up and delivery agents involved in  the pick-up, transportation and delivery of shipments, customs brokers and  information services/technology service providers.&nbsp; When transferring personal information to  third parties, we use contractual or other means to provide a level of  protection comparable to our own level of protection while the personal information  is in the third party’s custody.&nbsp; In  addition, we may share personal information with Purolator’s affiliates for the  purpose of facilitating one or more of the purposes described above.&nbsp; Due to the location of some of these third  parties and affiliates or the location of their computer servers, personal  information is sometimes transferred, processed and held outside of Canada or on  virtual servers.&nbsp; <br>
              </p>
              <p class="Contenttext">&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="Contenttext">We reserve the right to co-operate fully with local,  provincial, state and federal officials in any investigation relating to any  personal information (including private  electronic communications transmitted on any Purolator website) or any  purported unlawful activities. We also reserve the right to disclose and/or  transfer personal information to a third party in the event of a proposed or  actual direct or indirect sale, merger or other transfer of the assets or shares  of Purolator Inc. or a division thereof, provided that the third party agrees  to adhere to the principles expressed in this Privacy Statement and the  information does not constitute all or substantially all of the assets being  transferred.&nbsp; <br>
                </p>
              <p class="Contenttext">&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="Contenttext">Except as stated above,  we will not, without our customers’ consent, sell, share, transfer, license,  trade or rent personal information received from them to others.</p>
              <p class="Contenttext">&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="Contenttext"><strong>How We Obtain Consent</strong> <br>
                The form of consent we obtain from an individual, including  whether it is express or implied, will largely depend on the sensitivity of the  personal information and the reasonable expectations of the individual in the  circumstances. &nbsp;We will not, as a  condition of the supply of our products and services, require any individual to  consent to the collection, use or disclosure of his or her personal information  beyond that required to fulfill the purposes described above or otherwise described  at the time consent is sought. <br>
              </p>
              <p class="Contenttext">&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="Contenttext">When a customer provides  us with personal information relating to an individual other than themselves (such  as the intended recipient of the shipment), we rely on the customer who is  providing us with the personal information to obtain that individual’s consent  to our collection, use and disclosure of their personal information in the  circumstances described above. </p>
              <p class="Contenttext">&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="Contenttext"><strong>Withdrawing Consent</strong><br>
              Anyone may withdraw  consent to Purolator’s further use, retention or disclosure of their personal  information at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and  reasonable notice. Consent may be withdrawn by contacting Purolator at  1-888-280-9557 or <a href="mailto:privacy@purolator.com">privacy@purolator.com</a>. We will inform the person  who is withdrawing his or her consent of the implications of doing so.</p>
              <p class="Contenttext">&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="Contenttext"><strong>Cookies</strong> <br>
                A cookie is a small file containing information  that a website creates when you visit it. A cookie can track how and when someone  uses a website and/or other websites which they visited and can store that  information. There are two common types of cookies: "session cookies"  and "persistent cookies". Session cookies store information only for  the length of time that someone is connected to a website -- they are not  written onto the person’s hard drive. Once the person leaves the website, the  originator of the cookie no longer has the information that was contained on  it. We use session cookies as an additional security feature. <br>
                </p>
              <p class="Contenttext">&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="Contenttext">When our customers log on to our websites and are  authenticated through their User ID and password, a cookie will store the  identification number of their browser. Throughout their session, the session  cookie acts as a type of digital signature to identify our customer’s current  session to the web server. The web server will monitor our customer’s browser number  to ensure that, at all times during the session, we are dealing with our  customer. <br>
                </p>
              <p class="Contenttext">&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="Contenttext">We also use session  cookies to track our customers’ visits to our website. &nbsp;We use that information to determine the type  of information that our customers are looking for on our website and to improve  our website. We use information about the site our customers visited  immediately prior to our site to assess the viability of links to our site that  we have created on third party sites. &nbsp;The  information stored in "persistent cookies" is written onto our  customer’s hard drive and remains there until the expiry date of the cookie. &nbsp;From time to time, we use persistent cookies  to store non-sensitive personal information. Currently, most browsers do not  distinguish between session cookies and persistent cookies. For our websites to  operate, our customer’s browser must be set to accept cookies. If a customer is  concerned about having his or her browser enabled to accept cookies while he or  she is surfing other websites, we recommend that his or her browser be set to  notify him or her when it is receiving a cookie. This gives the customer the  ability to accept or reject cookies presented by the web server he or she is visiting.  We suggest contacting the browser’s programmer on how to do this. </p>
              <p class="Contenttext">&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="Contenttext"><strong>How We Protect Personal  Information</strong><br>
                We make all  commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that personal information collected  is protected against loss and unauthorized access. &nbsp;Access to our customers’ personal information  is restricted to selected Purolator employees and contractors. In addition, we  employ generally accepted information security techniques, such as firewalls,  access control procedures and cryptography, to protect personal information  against loss and unauthorized access. &nbsp;While  we use commercially reasonable efforts to limit access to our vehicles and  premises to authorized personnel, we cannot guarantee the confidentiality of  information that is displayed on any shipment package or shipment label. </p>
              <p class="Contenttext">&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="Contenttext"><strong>Retention of  Personal Information</strong> <br>
                We retain our customers’  personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which  it was collected and to comply with applicable laws. </p>
              <p class="Contenttext">&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="Contenttext"><strong>Links to Third Party  Sites</strong> <br>
                Our website may offer  links to other websites. Customers should be aware that operators of linked  websites may also collect our customers’ personal information (including  information generated through the use of cookies) when they link to those websites.  We are not responsible for how such third parties collect, use or disclose our  customers’ personal information, so it is important for our customers to  familiarize themselves with the privacy policies of such third parties before  providing them with personal information. </p>
              <p class="Contenttext">&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="Contenttext"><strong>Changes to this  Privacy Statement</strong> <br>
              We reserve the right to  modify this Privacy Statement at anytime without notice. The Privacy Statement  posted at any time or from time to time via this website shall be deemed to be  the Privacy Statement then in effect. </p>
              <p class="Contenttext">&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="Contenttext"><strong>Access</strong> <br>
              Anyone may contact us at  1-888-280-9557 or <a href="mailto:privacy@purolator.com">privacy@purolator.com</a> to request access to or the  correction or update of their personal information.
