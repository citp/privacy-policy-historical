# Puritan's Pride Privacy Policy

Puritan's Pride cares about your privacy. We respect the privacy of all your personal information and understand the need to protect it. We are committed to giving you choices about your personal information. This policy will tell you more about our commitment to your privacy, explain what information we collect and how it is used, and provide you with specific choices concerning that information. 

This policy applies to consumers accessing Puritan's Pride's sites, and those of its affiliates, in the United States. 

Our Commitment  
Puritan's Pride complies with the Direct Marketing Association's (DMA), "Privacy Promise to American Consumers." We (1) provide customers with notice of their ability to opt out of information sharing with other marketers; (2) honor customers' requests not to share their information with other marketers; and (3) honor customers' requests not to receive solicitations from Puritan's Pride. 

The Information We Collect  
In general, you can visit many of our web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. However, we receive and store certain types of information whenever you visit one of our sites. We may track the Internet domain address from which people visit us and analyze this data for trends and statistics, but individual users will remain anonymous, unless you voluntarily tell us who you are. 

We may use "cookies" that allow our system to recognize your browser and help us personalize your online experience. 

We also may receive information about you, such as updated delivery and address information, from other sources. In the course of our business, we may sell or buy stores, subsidiaries or other business units. Customer data may be transferred in a business transaction, but it will remain subject to our privacy policy. 

There may be times, such as when you order a product, register to receive catalogs or email offers, or register to participate in other services or promotions, at which we ask you to provide information about yourself. This could include your name, shipping and billing addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, and credit card or other information. 

Whether or not you provide such information is completely your own choice. But if you choose not to provide the information we request, you may be unable to access certain services or promotions. 

How We Use Your Information  
We use the personally identifiable information you provide for internal purposes, such as confirming and tracking your order, confirming your receipt of emails, registration, analyzing trends and statistics, informing you of our new products, services, offers, and promotions and so on. 

Puritan's Pride may share or store your information with that of our affiliated companies. Also, from time to time, we engage others to perform certain functions for us. We may give third party providers access to personal information to the extent they need it to perform their tasks, but we do not permit them to use this information for any other purpose. In addition, we may share your information with select marketing partners. It is our intention that these companies be highly targeted to your interests and preferences. We describe below how you may choose to opt-out of contact from our marketing partners. 

To serve you better, we may combine information you give us online, in stores, through mailings, or other marketing media. We use that combined information to enhance and personalize your shopping experience with us, and to communicate with you about our products, services and promotions that may be of interest to you
