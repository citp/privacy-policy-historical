# Pure Networks - Privacy Policy

Last Updated October 5, 2007 

Your privacy concerns are important to Pure Networks, so we have created the following Privacy Policy to explain our information collection and use practices. This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect through our products and services, how this information is used, and how you may opt-out of this collection. Please take a moment to read this Privacy Policy. By using our products and services, you consent and agree to the information collection and practices described in this policy. 

**Why We Collect Personal Information**  
Pure Networks collects and uses your personal information to give you superior customer service, to provide you with convenient access to our products and services, to alert you to available upgrades and products, and to assist us in making a wider range of our products available to you. In addition, we use your personal information to keep you up to date on the latest product announcements, software updates, special offers, and other information. This may occasionally include information from other technology companies about products and services that can add value to your Pure Networks products. Certain features of the Network Magic product (e.g., Network Reports, Network Advisor, and Support Services) may collect and relay network-related information. From time to time, we may also use your personal information to contact you to participate in a market research survey, so that we can gauge customer satisfaction and develop better products. 

**How We Collect Personal Information**  
We collect information about you in several ways. 

  * When you install one of our products, we ask you for contact information so we can communicate with you about your product trial and product keys. 
  * When you purchase a product from Pure Networks, we require your contact and payment information for billing purposes. 
  * When you correspond with us, contact us to request support, register to attend a seminar, or participate in an online survey. 
  * When you register a new Pure Networks product or ask to be included in an email mailing list. 
  * By using certain features of the Network Magic product (Network Reports, Network Advisor, or Support Services), we collect information about your network and use it to provide helpful information to you.
  * Non-personally identifiable information about the status and health of Network Magic and your home network may also be collected. This information is transmitted back to us so that we can determine how users are interacting with our products and assist us in improving our products. We may share this information with select third parties in an anonymous aggregated form. You may opt-out of the collection of this information at any time by uninstalling Network Magic from your computer.
  * By creating a Network Magic "store account." To save you time and make our Web services easier to use, the Network Magic store allows you to create an account using your personal information. This information includes your name, address, and email address and helps streamline future purchases.
  * Pure Networks logs non-personally-identifiable information including IP address, page requests, aggregate user data, and browser type, from visitors to our Web site. This data is used to manage our Web site, track usage and improve the Web site services.



**Collection of Non-Personally and Personally-Identifiable Information**  
By setting up the Network Magic feature, **Network Reports** , you give Pure Networks permission to collect personally-identifiable information. This information is linked to your email address, and therefore is personally identifiable. This feature is available on an opt-in basis, and you must proactively enable the feature for it to collect data. For more information, please refer to the Network Magic EULA. 

The Network Magic feature, **Network Magic Advisor** , collects information about your home network on an opt-out basis. You can opt out of sending information about your home network through the Network Magic Advisor feature by clicking on the “Turn off customization” link at the bottom of any Network Advisor page. If you turn off customization, Network Magic Advisor will continue to function, but it will not offer customized information based on what is on your network. 

The **Support Services** feature collects information about your network devices on an opt-out basis. If you agree to use this feature, information about your network devices is sent to Pure Networks and is used by a Support representative while assisting you with a network problem. The information is associated with you only when you provide a unique ID number to the Support representative while you are receiving help. 

**When We Disclose Personal Information**  
Pure Networks does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances: 

  * We may provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Pure Networks under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help Pure Networks communicate with you about offers from Pure Networks and our partners, and to determine what those offers may be. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.
  * We may be required by law or legal process to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we believe that disclosure is necessary for the public interest.
  * If Pure Networks or a portion of our assets are acquired by another company, customer information, including personally identifiable information, may be one of the transferred assets.



**How To Opt-Out**  
When installing or purchasing Network Magic we give you the option to opt out of future email communications other than critical updates. You can also unsubscribe or subscribe at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link included in our email communications and on our Web sites.

Accordingly, we welcome your feedback regarding any privacy concerns that you may have, including how we can improve our products and services.
