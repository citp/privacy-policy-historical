	A strong relationship with our users is essential.  A critical part of these relationships is establishing trust and confidence, which is why the privacy and security of your data has always been our priority for over 23 years.  Over the last few months we have worked to get all of our web properties secured by HTTPS.  We have secured not just the Contact, Login and Registration forms; but, your entire surfing experience is safe.<br><br>
	With the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) set to take effect on May 25, 2018 we are in the process of deploying updates allowing us to comply with new regulations and ensure people can continue using BEI (Badpuppy Enterprises, Inc.) properties with confidence.  Although GDPR applies only to data collected from persons located in the European Union (EU), our goal is to continuously implement network-wide improvements and new functionalities for all BEI users.<br><br>
	If you notice an area of our site where you feel we can do a little better, please don't hesitate to contact us.

        <strong>Our Disclosure of Your Information: </strong>
        Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your communications and other personally identifiable information will never
        be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose
        information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private
        communications, or users may abuse or misuse your information that they collect from our Site. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices
        to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable information or private communications will
        always remain private.<br><br>

        <strong>Security - How We Protect Your Data: </strong>
        Badpuppy.com uses industry standard practices to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal identifiable information. Badpuppy.com treats data as
        an asset that must be safeguarded against loss and unauthorized access. We employ several different security techniques to protect such data from
        unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.<br><br>
        We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information.<br><br>
        The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Site like message boards. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the Site.<br>

        <a name="11"></a>
        <strong>Data Breach: </strong>
        In the event of a Data Breach all parties will be notified within 72 hours of discovery, where feasible.  Notification may be sent via email, text message, physical mail or any other means of expeditious contact.

        <strong>User Contributions: </strong>
	We may provide areas on the website where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others, upload content (e.g., text, pictures, videos, audio files, etc.), and post comments or reviews of content found on the website. Such postings are governed by our Terms of Services located at https://PuppyCash.com/index.php/terms-of-service. If you use a forum, blog, bulletin board, channel, chat room, user commenting features, or other interactive sharing or social features that may be offered through our Site, you should be aware that any personal information you submit, display, or publish there is considered publicly available and can be read, collected, used, and disclosed by other users of those features, by us, and other third parties without restriction, except to the extent limited access features are available, if any. In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting. If you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information. Once you have posted information, you may not be able to edit or delete such information. To request removal of your personal information from our blog, sharing service or community forum, for example, send us an e-mail at support@badpuppy.com. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

        practices. All changes to this policy are effective after we post the changes on our Site.
