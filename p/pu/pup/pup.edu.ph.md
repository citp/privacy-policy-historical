# PUP : Help and Support Center : Privacy Statement

PUPWebSite is very much aware in protecting your privacy and personal information. This statement discloses how PUPWebSite helps protect your personal information while using PUPWebSite. This Privacy Statement only applies to PUPWebSite.  Other sites that has a link from this site may have a separate privacy statement. Please read the PUPWebSite Privacy Statement carefully.

* * *

PUPWebSite uses PUPWebSite Connect ("Connect") as its registration and authentication service. When you sign-up to Connect, you will be asked to provide your username and a password. This same Connect Account allows you to access many other Connect Services.

By using PUPWebSite, you consent to the data practices described in this statement.

* * *

**Collection of Personal Information**

We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information") or allows us to contact you. Generally, this information is requested when you sign-up for PUPWebSite Connect; or when you participate in University surveys, which are conducted online.

As described in greater detail below, we collect and process Personal Information for three major reasons: (1) to operate an authentication service, (2) to facilitate registration at member services that request personal information from you for the purposes intended by the service, and (3) to improve security and provide customer support for your Connect Account.

We keep this information on file with any information you've already given us on previous visits to PUPWebSite.

* * *

**Collection of Other Information**

Aside from the Personal Information, PUPWebSite (together with Google® Analytics) also collects certain information about your computer system. This information includes your (1) IP address, (2) browser type, (3) operating system, (4) domain name, (5) access times, and (6) referring Web site addresses. The collection of these data may occur every initial access and specific pages within PUPWebSite.  This information is used for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding the use of PUPWebSite.

PUPWebSite also collects information about which pages you visit within the site. This site visitation data is identified only by a unique ID number, and it is never linked with any Personal Information unless you give your consent, as described below.

* * *

**Information Collected by PUPWebSite**

PUPWebSite collects only that information which is necessary to carry out specific purposes. However, PUPWebSite does not collect any other information not indicated in this clause, whether you are signed in or not from PUPWebSite Connect.

When you sign-up for a Connect Account, you will be asked to provide certain Personal Information that will be stored in the MyProfile component of Connect. As described below, the amount of information requested contains, at most, the following information: (1) First Name, (2) Middle Name, (3) Last Name, (4) Gender, (5) Status, (6) Birth Date, (7) Home Country, (8) Current Location, (9) Occupation, (10) E-Mail Address, (11) Description, (12) School, (13) College, (14) Field of Study, and (15) Academic Status.

When you sign-up for your Connect Account, you will be asked to create a username and password. You are also requested to select a secret question and provide a secret answer. You use your secret question and answer to help verify your identity to Connect when there are account issues, such as needing to retrieve your password. 

Connect associates a unique identifier with every account at sign-in. The unique identifier is a generated unique encrypted number that Connect uses to all Connect Services when you choose to sign-in. This unique identifier makes it possible for the site to determine whether you are the same person from one sign-in session to the next. Your unique identifier is viewable in Connect > View MyProfile.

Connect also temporarily logs individual sign-ins for the purpose of ensuring the efficiency and security of the Connect Service. The information in these logs is identified only by the account's unique ID number, and it is never linked with Personal Information. 

* * *

**Collection of Optional Information in MyProfile**

Optional Information is also collected in the MyProfile. You have the option to fill-in the information or not.  Optional Information includes: (1) Home Information (Address, City/Municipality, Country, State/Province, Zip Code, Contact Number, Fax Number), and (2) Work Information (Company Name, Address, City/Municipality, Country, State/Province, Zip Code, Contact Number, Fax Number). These information are shared only upon your approval should any of your former classmates or friends wants to contact you.

* * *

**Use of your Personal Information**

**How PUPWebSite Will NOT Use Your Personal Information  
**PUPWebSite will not give, sell or rent your Personal Information to third parties; and PUPWebSite will not use or share your Personal Information in a manner that differs from what is described in this Privacy Statement without your prior consent. 

**How PUPWebSite Uses Your Personal Information  
**PUPWebSite uses your Personal Information for the operation and maintenance of your Connect Account and the Connect Service. For example, Connect uses your e-mail address to send you a welcome e-mail message when you first sign-up informing you about the Service, telling you how to manage your Connect Account. You will receive a separate e-mail to which you must respond in order to validate that you are the owner of the e-mail address associated with the Connect Account.  This process is designed to verify the validity of the e-mail address and to help prevent e-mail addresses from being used without permission in the creation of Connect Accounts. 

PUPWebSite may also send you e-mail about periodic service or updates. These periodic e-mails are considered essential to the provision of the Services. You cannot unsubscribe from these mailings.

If you need to retrieve your password, Connect sends it thru your e-mail.

  * To ensure our site is relevant to your needs;
