# Privacy Policy | 7-Eleven

Privacy Policy for 7-Eleven, Inc

7-Eleven, Inc., (“7-Eleven,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) the operator of the 7-Eleven.com and Slurpee.com web sites (the “Site” or “Sites”) and certain mobile application(s) (“Apps”) is committed to preserving the privacy of those who visit the Sites or who use the Apps. This document will outline how we gather and utilize various sources of information obtained during: (i) your visit to the Sites and use of the Apps, (ii) your participation in the 7Rewards loyalty program described at www.7eleven.com/7rewards (the “Program”), and (iii) in-store visits via beacons or Wi-Fi. This Privacy Statement applies solely to information collected at the Sites and via the Apps and via in-store beacons or in-store Wi-Fi. This Privacy Statement does not apply to any other data gathered or used by 7-Eleven including data otherwise collected in stores or through web sites not listed above.

Information Collection:

Personal and Non-Personal Information:

When using the Sites and Apps, in order to utilize some of the services, you may be asked to provide, or you may choose to submit, certain personally identifiable information about yourself ("Personal Information"). Personal Information can include your name, birth date, gender, email address, physical address and telephone number or other information you may provide. We may also leverage social network information (e.g. photos) when we have permission to do so. For example, we may collect information when you connect or interact with 7-Eleven via a social media service.

Personal Information does not include transactional data related to purchases at 7-Eleven stores, unless we combine such transaction data with your Personal Information, which we may do. In addition, we may also collect non-personally identifiable information, such as IP host address, pages viewed, browser type, duration and frequency of visits, and other data, and may aggregate any information collected in a manner which does not identify any individual ("Aggregate Information"). Information obtained in connection with the Sites and/or Apps may be intermingled with and used by us in conjunction with information obtained through sources other than the Sites and/or Apps, including both offline and online sources. By using the Sites or the Apps you consent to the collection and use of this type of information.

We and our service providers may collect Personal Information in a variety of ways, including:

Through the Services: We may collect Personal Information through the Sites, Apps, and through the Program, e.g., when you register, sign up for a newsletter, or participate in a promotion.

Apps:

In addition to the information above, the following applies to our Apps:

Our Apps collect certain information as part of their normal operations, such as the type of mobile device you use, the temporary or persistent unique device identifiers (sometimes called UDID), and information about the way you use the Apps. The Apps may also collect certain information you voluntarily provide, such as product information when you scan a bar code, and transactional information, such as when you make a purchase or respond to an offer.

Our Apps also collect information about the precise location of your device, such as when you search for a store. You must first provide permission through your device before the App obtains such location. We may combine this information with other location-based information, such as your IP address and billing or postal code, for example, to give you information about stores near you and to provide you with other services on your mobile device. We may share your location information with companies that help us provide you with services and to help us understand how the services are being used. You may stop the collection of this information at any time by changing the settings on your mobile device, but note that some features of our Apps may no longer function if you do so.

We may disclose or otherwise make available personal information about you to third party service providers that assist us in the design, development and/or operation of our Apps. We may also work with analytic companies to help us understand how our Apps are being used, such as the frequency and duration of usage. These providers may collect device-specific information, such as a unique device identifier, when you use our Sites or one of the Apps. The device identifier is used to improve services within our Apps such as barcode scanners. Our service providers may not use or disclose personal information for any purpose other than for providing the services on our behalf.

You can stop all collection of information by our Apps easily by uninstalling the Apps. You may use the standard uninstall processes available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.

Even after you opt out, service providers may collect device-specific information (such as a unique device identifier) when you use our Site. However, the Apps will not collect such information.

Beacons. 7-Eleven may collect information about the location of your device when you visit a store. For example, we may collect in-store location information using Bluetooth signals to connect to our Beacons and help you while inside our store to utilize the Mobile Scan and Pay Feature of the 7-Eleven App, to find nearby products or receive real-time offers. We may use the data we collect to improve and make the 7-Eleven in-store experience more interactive, for internal operations, for marketing and promotions and advertising, and for fraud prevention and security. Beacons transmit a Bluetooth signal that can be received by Bluetooth-enabled devices, such as a mobile phone, when those devices are within proximity of a beacon. By acting similar to radar systems, Beacons only push out radio signal pulses to map nearby Bluetooth-enabled devices. Beacons do not collect or pull in personal data. Within the Apps, in-app permissions (such as permission to access location and accept Push Notifications) must be enabled for a Beacon to interact with your specific Bluetooth-enabled device. Interactions with and notifications delivered to your device may include customer service information, in-store directions, offers and advertisements from 7-Eleven as well as other non-7-Eleven applications and advertisers. With or without the Apps, Beacon preferences are managed through your device settings. You may stop the collection of this information at any time by disabling Bluetooth communication on your mobile device, but note that the Apps may no longer function properly if you do so.

In-Store Wi-Fi. Some 7-Eleven locations offer Wi-Fi services to visitors. Wi-Fi routers capture certain data from devices that interact with the router. Some examples of data automatically collected through our Wi-Fi service may include: (a) information about your device, including a MAC Address, and telemetry data (such as signal strength and quality) related to your use of our Wi-Fi service; or (b) vendors that analyze Wi-Fi data automatically collected to provide operational insights such as foot traffic volumes, dwell times, and how costumers move through our stores. Unless we receive consent to use Wi-Fi data in a manner that identifies you or your device(s), Wi-Fi data is anonymously collected or de-identified.

From Other Sources:

We may receive your Personal Information from other sources, such as public databases; joint marketing partners; social media platforms; people with whom you are friends or otherwise connected on social media platforms; and other third parties. For example, if you connect your social media account to your 7-Eleven account, or create or log into your 7-Eleven account through a social media site, certain information from your social media account will be shared with us, which may include Personal Information that is part of your profile or your friends’ profiles. In addition, we may supplement the Personal Information that you provide us and/or the Other Information we collect from you with demographic, social, and other information about you that we receive from other sources. Once we combine data from other sources with your Personal Information collected pursuant to this policy, we apply this policy to the combined data as long as it is combined. However, this Privacy Policy does not apply to the original source or uncombined data. 7-Eleven has no control over the content or privacy policies of the third party social networking sites. If you choose to create an account or log into your account through a third party social networking website, 7-Eleven is not responsible or liable for the privacy practices or content of such websites.

Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technology:

We and our third party partners and service providers may use various tracking technologies, including cookies and web beacons, to collect information about you when you interact with our Sites and Apps, including information about your browsing and purchasing behavior. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory, either for only the duration of your visit (“session cookies”) or for a fixed period of time (“persistent cookies”). Cookies help us improve the Sites’ and Apps’ functionality and performance, improve your user experience and convenience, see which areas and features of the Sites and Apps are popular, count visits, and tailor your experience. Web beacons are electronic images that may be used in the Sites, Apps or emails and help deliver cookies, count visits, and test and understand usage and campaign effectiveness. We may also allow third parties to set cookies through the Sites and Apps in order to help us manage and analyze the performance of the Sites and Apps, to display ads and offer promotions that we think are most relevant to you, to help us learn about our audience and how people use the Sites, the Apps and the Program, and to link your activity on the Sites, the Apps or the Program to your social network accounts. The information collected may include the type of device, your operating system, your browser, your internet service provider, your domain name, your internet protocol (IP) address, the date and time that you accessed our Sites and Apps or participated in the Program, the website that referred you to our Sites, the web pages you requested, the date and time of those requests, and the subject of the ads you click or scroll over.

If you do so, however, you may not be able to fully experience some features of the Sites, the Apps and the Program.

Clickstream:

As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each web site you visit. This information, which is sometimes referred to as "clickstream data," can be collected and stored by a web site's server. Clickstream data can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use and the address of the web site from which you linked to the Sites. We may collect and use clickstream data to determine how much time visitors spend on each page of our Sites, how visitors navigate throughout the Sites and how we may tailor our web pages to better meet the needs of visitors. This information will be used to improve our Sites and our services.

Analytics Services Provided by Others:

These providers may use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect device-specific information, such as a unique device identifier, when you use our Sites, Apps or Program. The device identifier is used to improve services within our Apps such as barcode scanners.

Interest Based Advertising:

We may participate in Interest-based and behavioral advertising. This means that you may see advertising on our website tailored to how you engage, browse or shop, or you may see advertising for 7-Eleven on other websites, applications and social media based on your behavior across websites, applications and social media. We may target ads based on data we have collected, or data provided by third parties alone or in combination with the data we collect ourselves. By using the Sites or the Apps you agree to usage tracking and targeted, behavioral advertising. If you do not wish to have cookies track your usage for these purposes please see the section in this Privacy Policy on disabling cookies or do not use the Sites and the Apps.

We may permit third parties (such as Amazon) to place and use pixels on our Sites. Pixels enable such parties to show you interest-based ads on sites across the Internet (such as special offers to you for 7-Eleven products and services via the Amazon Ad Platform and via social networks).
