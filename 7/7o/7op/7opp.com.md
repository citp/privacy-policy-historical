Children’s Privacy

**

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 18. If we learn that we have personal information on a child under the age of 18, we will delete that information from our systems. 7opp.com encourages parents to go online with their kids. Here are a few tips to help make a child's online experience safer:

Teach kids never to give personal information or information about their friends, unless supervised by a parent or responsible adult. Personal information includes but is not limited to name, address, phone, email address, school, church, clubs, etc. 

Know the sites your kids are visiting and which sites are appropriate. 

Look for Web site privacy policies. Know how your child's information is treated.
