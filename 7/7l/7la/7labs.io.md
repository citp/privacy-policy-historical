## Data We Collect

### 1\. Data You Provide to Us

In addition to the information that you provide to us, we may also collect information about you during your visit to the Website. We collect this information using automated tools that are detailed below.

#### Log Files

7labs follows a standard procedure of using log files. These files log visitors when they visit websites. All hosting companies do this and a part of hosting services’ analytics. The information collected by log files includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date and time stamp, referring/exit pages, and possibly the number of clicks. These are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable. The purpose of the information is for analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movement on the website, and gathering demographic information.

#### Cookies & Web Beacons

A “cookie” is a small data file transmitted from a website to your computer’s hard drive. Cookies are usually defined in one of two ways, and we may use both of them: (1) session cookies, which do not stay on your computer after you close your browser, and (2) persistent cookies, which remain on your computer until you delete them or they expire.

These cookies are used to store information including visitors’ preferences, and the pages on the website that the visitor accessed or visited. The information is used to optimize the users’ experience by customizing our web page content based on visitors’ browser type and/or other information.

We use the following categories of cookies on our Website.

 **Functional:** These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the Website, use its features, show the cookie notification bar, remember your cookie acceptance choice and apply this choice. These cookies cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.

 **Analytical:** These cookies are placed to make it possible for us to analyze user interactions with this Website (with Google Analytics) and optimize it to serve better content and usability.

 **Social Media:** Our Website uses cookies from third-party social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, etc., to improve the overall experience.

 **Advertising:** These cookies are placed in order to show you personalized advertisements (via Google AdSense) that are close to your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign.

 **Third-Party Ad Networks and Services**  
Third-party ad servers or ad networks may use technologies like cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons used in their respective advertisements and links appearing on 7labs, which are sent directly to users’ browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this occurs. These technologies are used to measure the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns and/or to personalize the advertising content that you see on websites that you visit.

 **Google DoubleClick DART Cookie**

Google is one of the third-party vendors on our Website. It also uses cookies, known as DART cookies, to serve ads to our Website visitors based upon their visit to other websites on the internet. However, visitors may choose to decline the use of DART cookies by visiting the Google ad and content network Privacy Policy at the following URL – <https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads>
