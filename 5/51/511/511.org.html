                                In the 511 Driving TimesSM service, MTC/511 operates a data collection  system based on FasTrak® toll tags to provide better information about  the transportation network to Bay Area travelers, transportation  managers, and transportation planners.</p>
                                    
                          		<p>In matters concerning traffic data collection, MTC/511 will take the  following steps to ensure the protection of personal information:</p>

                                	<li><p>The tag users' consent will be secured via a FasTrak® toll tag license  agreement before the operation of any data collection system based on  toll tags.</p></li>

                                </strong>The  511 phone system records your phone number, the date, time and duration  of your call, and what you asked the system. The call information is  used to compile anonymous data to improve 511 services.&nbsp; In addition,  when callers select such functions as making comments or suggestions or  voluntary participation in phone surveys, troubleshooting, contests and  special promotions, they choose to provide additional Personal  Information.&nbsp; Calls asking about agency-specific services may be  transferred to those agencies, at which point the privacy policy of the  receiving agency applies to the call and any Personal Information  provided or collected. </p>

We also publish  the relative geographic locations of participants in the particular  program to the other participants, such as by showing dots on a map  that may show the general neighborhood or location (though not specific  home or work addresses).

In addition, you may receive e-mail messages from the  MY 511 program administrators requesting you to review and update your  Personal Information or phone calls to provide follow-up assistance.</li>
