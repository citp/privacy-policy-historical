### What we collect and how we use it

#### Information you provide to us

  1. **Account/login information** , such as username (does not have to be a real name) and e-mail address (no discrimination of hosts), is used to facilitate account creation, authentication, and authorization. We may use your email address to contact you in regards to your account and the services it is signed up for. Additionally, you can subscribe and unsubscribe to product updates and such on our website, using this same email address. In order to manage your email preferences, please visit your [account settings page](https://5apps.com/account/settings).

Billing information will also be used for our bookkeeping and accounting.

  4. **Support information** , such as information you provide when reporting a problem with our services, request support from us, or otherwise correspond with us, will be used to provide such support and investigate the problem at hand.

  5. **Publicly accessible data** , i.e. public profile information from connected sites, such as GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket, will be used to improve your experience by for example pre-filling your username, or automatically importing your public SSH keys.




#### Information we collect automatically

  1. **Browser information** , such as browser type, IP address, language, device type, and operating system, will be used to improve the quality of our services and enhance your experience.

If you signal your preference to not have this data collected, it will never enter our database.

If you wish to delete your data, just head to your [account settings](https://5apps.com/account/settings) and use the button at the bottom of the page to cancel your account. Your data will be deleted automatically. However, we may retain a few necessary bits like e.g. invoicing information for our legally required bookkeeping.

### Data Storage

5apps uses third party vendors and hosting partners ("data processors") to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run our services. Although 5apps owns the code, databases, and all rights to the 5apps application, you retain all rights to your data.

We have so-called Data Processing Agreements with all our partners in order to ensure your privacy, according to the European Union's [General Data Protection Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.119.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:119:TOC).
