<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>This privacy policy describes how AppCache Ltd ("5apps", "we", "us", "our")
stores and processes personal data.</p>

<h3>What we collect and how we use it</h3>

<h4>Information you provide to us</h4>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Account/login information</strong>, such as username (does not have to be a
real name) and e-mail address (no discrimination of hosts), is used to
facilitate account creation, authentication, and authorization. We may
use your email address to contact you in regards to your account and the
services it is signed up for. Additionally, you can subscribe and
unsubscribe to product updates and such on our website, using this same
email address. In order to manage your email preferences, please visit
your <a href="https://5apps.com/account/settings">account settings page</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Billing information</strong> is required only when subscribing to a paid
plan, or making a one-time payment for a service. We may collect
credit/debit card details, or information related to other payment
methods, in order to facilitate payments. Optionally, you can provide
invoicing information, such as company name and address, and VAT ID,
which will be printed on your invoices. Billing information will also be
used for our bookkeeping and accounting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Developer information</strong>, such as developer/company name and email
addresses may be provided by you per app hosted on 5apps Deploy, in
order to be shown on public app pages, in app store entries, etc..</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Support information</strong>, such as information you provide when reporting
a problem with our services, request support from us, or otherwise
correspond with us, will be used to provide such support and investigate
the problem at hand.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Publicly accessible data</strong>, i.e. public profile information from
connected sites, such as GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket, will be used to
improve your experience by for example pre-filling your username, or
automatically importing your public SSH keys.</p></li>
</ol>

<h4>Information we collect automatically</h4>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Browser information</strong>, such as browser type, IP address, language,
device type, and operating system, will be used to improve the quality of

<li><p><strong>Usage information</strong>, such as information about your interactions with
our website and services, including pages visited, actions taken,
features used, and the date and time of such interactions, are stored
without personal identifiers, and used to improve our website and
services. We (always have and always will) respect your browser's
tracking configuration, namely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track">DNT (Do Not Track)
headers</a>. If you signal your
preference to not have this data collected, it will never enter our
database.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Please note: we do not use any external analytics services for
automatically collected browser and usage data, so it is never leaked to
bad actors, which may track you across the Internet for advertising and
surveillance purposes.</p>

<h3>Exporting or deleting your data</h3>

<h3>Sharing personal information with 3rd parties</h3>

<p>Personally identifiable information we collect is solely used to provide
our services, and is never shared with or sold to other organizations for

<p>In the event of a proposed merger, acquisition, financing, sale of assets
or in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership or other change of
control, your personal data may be disclosed to a successor or assignee as
part of our business assets. In such a case, you will be notified <em>in
advance</em> about the change of ownership or control, and will be able to have
your data deleted before it would be shared.</p>

<h3>Disclosure</h3>

<p>5apps may disclose personally identifiable information under special
circumstances, such as to comply with subpoenas or when your actions
violate the <a href="/terms">Terms of Service</a>. Any requests
have to comply with all legal requirements in the Netherlands, before we
consider disclosure.</p>
