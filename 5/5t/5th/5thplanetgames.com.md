# Privacy Policy | 5th Planet Games

Effective Date: 05/25/2010  
Most Recent Update: 07/29/2016

The news is filled with stories about privacy concerns. Given the sensitive nature of the material collected by many companies, users are understandably interested in what is being done with their personal information. Let’s talk about how 5th Planet Games, Inc. (“5th Planet”) will collect, use and protect your personal information. 

Please be aware, this Privacy Policy may be revised from time to time. By accessing the forums (the “Forums”) or playing any of the games created by 5th Planet (the “Games”), you agree to the terms of the most recent version of this Privacy Policy. By agreeing, you authorize us to collect and use your information as outlined below.

Remember, the Games exist on different platforms, and your activities on those platforms beyond the scope of the Games are governed by that specific platform’s privacy policy, not ours. You can find links to each of these policies at the bottom of this document.

Remember, the Games exist on the Facebook platform, and your activities on Facebook beyond the scope of the Games are governed by Facebook’s privacy policy, not ours. You can find Facebook’s privacy policy here:http://www.facebook.com/policy.php. 

WHAT IS PERSONAL INFORMATION?  
“Personal Information” can mean different things to different people. We define “Personal Information” as information that identifies you or can be used to contact you (online or offline). Personal Information can include things like your name, social security number, e-mail address, physical address, telephone number, drivers’ license, etc.

HOW DO WE END UP WITH PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU?  
Since the use of Personal Information is necessary to improving the quality of our games, we collect that information in a variety of ways: 

Information from Facebook: When you install any of the Games, we may obtain information about you from Facebook. The information we receive from Facebook includes things such as your name, locale, affiliations and gender. 

Facebook restricts the scope and uses of this information in its Developer Policies (http://developers.facebook.com/policy) and Statement of Rights (http://www.facebook.com/policy.php#!/terms.php). As you can imagine, we would rather not invite the wrath of Facebook by violating any of these policies.

Information from Third Parties: We may use service providers to provide you with a superior experience and they may share information they collect about you with us. Personal Information you provide to those third parties will fall under their respective privacy policies. If such a third party provides us with your Personal Information, we will handle it in accordance with this privacy policy (but be aware that the information retained by any third party is governed by their privacy policy, not ours).

Information from You: You may choose to voluntarily provide us with information by registering or communicating with 5th Planet. We will collect and record the information you have provided by registration or communicating with us. Other than names and e-mail addresses, we generally do not collect Personal Information through the registration process.

Viral Components: If you refer another user to us, we will collect and retain information such as the name and e-mail address of the referred individual. 

WHAT NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION DO YOU COLLECT?  
In addition to Personal Information, we collect a variety of data that could not be used to identify or contact you. Data are used to enhance the quality of our games, forums and other services. Here are some of the forms of non-personal information we collect:

User Generated Content: It is possible you may choose to share additional information about yourself through the Game and Forums in public spaces such as message boards or chats. Any action you perform with other players is considered public. Users should be aware that such public data may be harvested by third parties with access to it (such as other users).

Game Play Information: We may collect and retain information relating to your interaction with our game. For example, we may monitor the length of time you play a game, the number and type of activities you participate in during a particular session, and your scores.

General Use Information: We may also collect general information about your interaction with our product such as your internet protocol address, browser type, referring and exit URLs, click amounts, domain names, pages viewed, the amount of time spent viewing a particular page, the time of such activities, etc.

WHAT WE DO NOT DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION  
We Do Not Transfer Facebook Data. We do not directly or indirectly transfer any personal information we receive from Facebook to third parties. Even if you begged us to do it, we still wouldn’t.

We Do Not Sell, Lease, Rent Or Transfer Your Personal Information. We collect information for the purpose of improving our services. We may make certain aggregate information available to third parties (as outlined below), but we will not sell, rent, lease or otherwise transfer your Personal Information to any third parties except as provided below.

We May Log, But We Will Not Disclose, Individual Internet Protocol Addresses: We may maintain log files which contain IP addresses for purposes such as traffic monitoring. As you know, an IP address is a numeric address assigned to your computer (or router) by your Internet Service Provider. We will not disclose individual IP addresses to third parties. 

But please be aware, we will disclose information to the extend it may be necessary to prevent harm to third parties or it is required by law (as we specify below).

WHAT WE MAY DO WITH INFORMATION WE COLLECT  
Here are some of the things we may do with the information we collect. This includes both Personal Information and non-personal information. If we determine there are additional things we would like to do, we’ll amend this section to let you know about it.

Improve Our Services. We may use the information we collect to improve the quality of our games and forums as well as offer new features to you. This might include looking at how certain segments of the player-base interact with our product and what areas they may be most interested in seeing more content. We will also use the information to optimize our content by locating bugs in our games.

Notifications. We occasionally feel a pressing need to reach out to our players. Thankfully, the personal information you provide us with enable us to do that. We may contact you with game-related announcement from time to time. You may opt out of these communications.

Aggregate Data. Occasionally, Personal Information and non-personal information is more useful when we lump it in a big pile to get a better understanding of the general characteristics of our player-base. For example, knowing that 30% of our users are playing from a particular location may be important. We may disclose these general statistics (which will not include information capable of identifying or contacting any particular user) to enhance customer service, tailor the Games to your interests or optimize the Games.

Viral Components. You may decide to refer a friend to one of our Games. Typically this will be handled through built-in game mechanics that will not involve the transfer of any Personal Information to 5th Planet. However, in the event you do provide us with Personal Information relating to a referral, we will store it for a short period to ensure the referral took place and then eliminate the information.

Legal Requests and Harm Prevention. We may disclose information pursuant to subpoenas, court orders, or other requests if we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law. We may also share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activity, to prevent imminent bodily harm, or to protect ourselves and you from people violating the Terms of Service. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, courts or other government entities.

Transfer in the Event of Sale or Change of Control. If the ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner so that the services we provide you can continue to operate. In such a case, your information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy. 

SECURITY OF OUR SITE  
We use encryption and authentication tools to protect the security of the information that you share with us. Once we receive your transmission, we will do our best to protect its security on our systems. For example, we protect personal information we gather on a secured server behind a firewall; it is not directly connected to the Internet. 

Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to or from our Site, and you do so at your own risk. ACCORDINGLY, WE DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR ANY THEFT, LOSS, OR INTERCEPTION OF OR ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR DAMAGE TO ANY DATA OR COMMUNICATIONS. BY USING THE SITE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO ASSUME THESE RISKS.

OPTING OUT  
You may review, update, correct or delete Personal Information we receive from Facebook by updating that information on your Facebook profile. If you elect to register with us and you would like to review, update, correct or delete that Personal Information you have submitted directly to 5th Planet, you may do so by emailing [support@5thplanetgames.zendesk.com](mailto:support@5thplanetgames.com) with the subject line User Info.

COOKIES  
No cookies for you. Seriously. We don’t use cookies. Cookies are small text files applied to your Internet browser that can be used, for example, to track movements within websites.

LINKS  
It is fair to say the internet is a somewhat “dynamic” space and you may see links in the Games that might take you into that broader universe. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for your use of their services or for any use of your personal information by such third parties and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as ourselves. The presence of a third party link within the Games does not represent an endorsement of the content of that third party’s link and 5th Planet disclaims all liability arising from such content.

CHILDREN AND PRIVACY  
The Forums and the Games are not directed to children under the age of 13 years. In fact, children under the age of 13 years are prohibited from accessing Facebook or the Forums.

We will never request personally identifiable information from anyone whom we know to be under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent. By using the Game, you represent and warrant that you are at least 13 years old. If we become aware that a customer is under the age of 13 and has registered without prior verifiable parental consent, we will remove that user’s personal information.

We recommend that all minors 13 years and older seek parental consent before sending information about themselves to any individual or over the internet.
