    <p>We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.</p>

    <h3>What Personal Information Does Company Display or Collect?</h3>

    <p>The information we gather from users enables us to personalize and improve our services, and to allow our users to set up a user account and profile that can be used to interact with other users through the Site. In connection with the Site, we request and display some personal information to other users and visitors of the Site, which allows users to identify each other.</p>

    <p>We collect the following types of information from our users:</p>

    <p>1.  Personal Information You Provide to Us:</p>

    <p>When you register a profile with Company, your profile including any information you provide (name, address, gender) will be registered with Company.  We receive and store any information you provide in these ways, or otherwise enter on the Site or provide to us in any other way. In each case, we will collect and record the information you have provided. The types of Personal Information that we collect from you include your name, username, address, gender, email address, IP address and browser information, and possibly financial and billing information such as credit card or bank account number, name, street address, and phone number. We may also offer you the opportunity to submit other information about yourself (such as gender, age, occupation, hobbies, interests, zip code, etc.). </p>

    <p>You may choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. The Personal Information you provide may be used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain information, products and services, attribution for content you submit, customizing the advertising and content you see, allowing you to communicate with other users, and communicating with you about specials and new features. You may modify or remove any of your personal information at any time by logging into your account and accessing features to edit your profile and account information. </p>

    <p>You may choose to share information about yourself through the services on the Site, such as games.  Any action you perform with other players that requires the disclosure of information is considered public, and at your own risk and discretion. </p>

    <p>2.  Personal Information from Third Party Sources:</p>

    <p>When you identify yourself on the Site, you may also identify yourself through your account with a third-party social network system, and we may collect additional information from any such systems on which you have used any of our games or any SNS App (in accordance with the terms of use of those systems), which would then also be covered by this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p>We may use information about you that we collect from other sources, including but not limited to newspapers and Internet sources such as blogs, instant messaging services, and other users of the Site or associated services, to supplement your profile.</p>

          <h3>3. Personal Information Collected Automatically:</h3>

    <p>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with the Site or obtain services from us. We automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, browser type and language, referring/exit pages and URLs, other browser history, platform type, number of clicks, landing pages, Company cookie information, and the pages you requested and viewed, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time. We also record the details of your transactions on the Site.  For mobile devices used to access the Site or the Site's content, we receive and record the identification numbers of those devices.</p>

    <p>When you use an SNS App on your social network page or use an SNS App on someone else's page, we may record information regarding the use of that SNS App, and we may collect other information that is visible on your social network page, in accordance with the relevant Terms of Use associated with that page.  Note that since most Company Software is served through SNS Apps, it is your responsibility to read and accept the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy of any third party social network system provider prior to using such SNS App. When you invite new members into your network or send messages through the Service, we collect and maintain on secure servers the information associated with those messages, including email addresses and content.</p>

    <p>Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. We only use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often users use parts of the Site or services so that we can make the Site appealing to as many users as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our Site. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their services and the Site, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, Company never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.</p>
          <h3>E-mail Communications:</h3>

          <p>We often receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail from Company if your computer supports this type of program. Company uses this confirmation to help us make e-mails more interesting and helpful. If you do not want to receive e-mail communications from Company, you may opt out of those communications during the registration process, by changing the necessary settings in your user account or by sending us an e-mail at <strong>support@50cubes.com</strong>.</p>

          <h3>What About Cookies?</h3>

    <p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our Site are visited and by how many people. Company cookies do not collect Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or email address is. </p>

    <p>You should be aware that most content delivered through our games originates with third party content providers. These providers may place cookies on your browser, or otherwise gather information about you, including by asking you to provide information through the site itself.  This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Company and does not cover the use of cookies by any third party content providers.</p>

    <p>Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of the Site's most attractive features.</p>

    <p>Ads appearing on the Site may be delivered to users by our advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Company and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.    Similarly, third-party advertising companies may provide us with pixel tags to help manage and optimize our online advertising. Beacons enable us to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits the site on which the beacon is located, and to learn which banner ads bring users to a given site.  We do not provide any Personally Identifiable Information to third-party advertising companies. Note, however, that if an advertiser asks us to show an advertisement to users with certain characteristics (for example, women ages 18-24) or a segment of that group (for example, women ages 18-24 who have viewed certain categories of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the third-party advertising company may conclude that you have the characteristics of the audience that they are trying to reach.</p>
