Your payment information will not be stored on our website.   We do not currently offer any on-site direct payment gateway options to complete your purchase, but if we did, then 50 states Classifieds would store your credit card data. It would be encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Your purchase transaction data is stored only as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction information is deleted.   All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.   PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its service providers.   For more insight, you may also want to read the 2checkout.com and PayPal.com Terms of Service available on their websites.

So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.   As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in the United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act.   Once you leave our storeâ€™s website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our websiteâ€™s Terms of Service.
