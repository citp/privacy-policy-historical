**What personal information will we collect?**  
We will collect information that identifies you ("personal information") only when you voluntarily provide it to us. For example, when you decide to subscribe online for our magazine, or to complete an online survey, we may ask you to provide some personal information, such as your first and last name, mailing address and/or email address. When we collect such information, we will make every effort to link to this privacy policy.

**How will we use this information?**  
We will use this personal information to fulfill your online requests. For example, if you subscribe online for our magazine, we will use your personal information to process your request and to send you your magazine. We also may use this information to notify you of special offers, new products and other services about which you might be interested if you opted in on the order form. If at any time you decide that you do not wish to receive these types of communications, simply follow the unsubscribe features contained in any email from us or change your preferences on the Your Subscription page of our website. We may use this information in aggregate form in various ways; for example, to help us evaluate and modify existing services, and to help us develop additional services that are likely to be of interest to our users. 5280 Magazine may do research on our users' demographics, interests and behavior based on the information provided to us upon registration, during a promotion, from our server log files and from surveys. We do this to better understand and serve our users. 5280 Magazine may share this aggregated data with advertisers or business partners. Under confidentiality agreements, 5280 Magazine may match aggregated user information with third party data. Also, 5280 Magazine may disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.

**With whom will we share this information?**  
We will share your personal information with companies that assist in fulfilling subscriptions or provide contractual services for us. For example, we allow access to our database by third parties that provide us with services, such as technical maintenance or forums software, but only for the purpose of and to the extent necessary to provide you with those services. Any third party that has access to our database for this purpose is bound by the terms set forth in this policy. If you opted in on the order form, we also may share your personal information that we collect online with our current or future affiliated companies and with select third parties that may email you information or special offerings about products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. It is your choice to allow us to disclose your personal information to third parties for this purpose, and your choice will not affect the cost of your service. This free choice also applies to personal information that we collect from you offline and you can choose not to have information shared by us with third parties for marketing by calling, writing, or e-mailing us.
