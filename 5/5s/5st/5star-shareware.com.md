## Privacy Policy

5 Star Network Limited respects the privacy of visitors to any Website owned and operated by the network.

When a visitor requests pages from any 5 Star Network site, our Web servers automatically recognize the browser's domain name and IP address. Our servers do not record e-mail addresses. We collect the domain names and IP addresses in order to aggregate information on the pages users access or visit. This information is used solely for statistical purposes and not to identify individuals.

From time to time, we may ask users to provide an e-mail or mailing address for the purpose of conducting a survey or to provide additional services (e.g. subscriptions to e-mail newsletters). Before the identity of a visitor is recorded, we will clearly indicate the purpose of the request for information.
