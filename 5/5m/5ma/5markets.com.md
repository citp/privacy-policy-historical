## Refunds Policy

First-time customers who choose to use 5Markets for their trading needs can rely on our refunds policy to help them feel secure as they navigate the sometimes difficult waters of Forex trading.

Refunds requested after that time will be made through wire transfer. We reserve the right to alter the methods of repayment at any time.

 **IMPORTANT:** Refunds are only issued once the cancellation of an account has been verified.

In the unlikely case of a systems failure, 5markets customers should email their account manager and the support team with a full account of the problem. The more information customers can provide us about the error, the quicker the problem can be verified. Customers should include:
