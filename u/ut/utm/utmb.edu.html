        <p>This privacy statement is applicable to <a href="http://www.utmb.edu/">www.utmb.edu</a>
        and the public web sites directly created and maintained by the
        University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, Texas (UTMB). The
        following statement applies to the public and addresses the types and
        use of information gathered on the university’s web sites.</p>
        <p>UTMB does not collect personally
        identifiable information about individuals except when individuals
        intentionally provide such information in a question, transaction, on a
        web form or other web-based communication sent to the university.
        Personally identifiable information sent to UTMB, such as an email
        message requesting information on a health topic, may be seen and
        addressed by staff for the purposes necessary to serve a message sender’s
        needs. It will not be sold or otherwise transferred to unaffiliated
        third parties without a visitor’s explicit consent or unless required
        by law.</p>
        <p>UTMB may collect non-personal information—items
        such as date &amp; time, a visitor’s web browser and version, the
        pages visited and the referring site—to perform statistical analyses
        of user trends and interests and to generate general reports based on
        this information, ultimately to better serve the users of this resource.
        This non-personal information is stored in server logs and again, will
        not be sold or otherwise transferred unless required by law</p>
        <p>Users also should be aware that
        non-personal information and data may be automatically collected through
        the use of "cookies," small text files a site can use to
        recognize repeat visitors and enhance a user's access to and use of a
        site. Generally, cookies work by assigning visitors a unique number that
        has no meaning outside a specific site. Cookies are not programs that go
        onto a user’s system and damage files. Information that UTMB may
        collect or store in cookies is used for internal purposes only and is
        not sold or shared. Most web browsers also give users the ability to
        decline any "cookies" they may be offered by UTMB or others;
        browser "Help" files offer more information on this feature.</p>
        <p>Additionally, users should be aware that
        when they voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information
        (e.g., user name, e-mail address) on the public bulletin boards,
        discussion groups or in the chat areas of UTMB sites, that information
        and any electronic "conversation" can be collected and used by
        non-UTMB parties.</p>
        <p>Likewise, electronic mail and other
        Internet communications are not always secure against interception. UTMB
        has security measures and practices in place to help protect a visitor’s privacy and
        prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of information sent to the
        university.</p>
        <p>It is possible that some web pages at
        UTMB may collect information about visitors and use that information for
        purposes other than those stated above. When this is the case, the
        details of the data collection and use will be spelled out via a
        distinct "privacy statement" link on the respective site.</p>
        <p>Please address any questions about UTMB’s
        privacy policy and practices, or use of this web site, to
        <a href="mailto:public.affairs@utmb.edu?subject=From the Privacy Policy page...">
        public.affairs@utmb.edu</a>. Or, write to the university via the postal 
        service at UTMB Public Affairs, 301 University Boulevard, Galveston, TX, 
        77555-0144.</p>
        <p>This policy is effective August 14, 2000.
        UTMB reserves the right to modify this policy by notifying users of the
        existence of a new privacy statement. This statement and the policies
        outlined are not intended to and do not create any contractual or other
        legal rights in or on behalf of any party.</p>
