<h3 align="center">Privacy Policy and Disclaimer for the Utah State Courts.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;
 </p><p> 
The constitutions of Utah and of the United States protect the people's right to an open and public court. Anyone can attend most court hearings, and anyone can view and obtain a copy of most court records. However, the people who do business with the courts - parties, witnesses, victims, jurors, and others - have rights of privacy also protected by our state and federal constitutions. Neither right is absolute; each is balanced by the other.

</p><p>Still, to participate in the judicial process, people sacrifice a good deal of their privacy. It is a sacrifice necessary to protect the integrity and accountability of the courts. 

</p><p>The Utah Supreme Court and the Utah Judicial Council have adopted rules that regulate court records. Some records are closed but most are public. (Rule 4-202.02.). Even closed records can be viewed by some. (Rule 4-202.03). Public records are provided to anyone who asks, and some public records are posted on this website. There may be a fee for access to some records. (Rule 4-202.08.) Non-public records may be shared with other governmental entities under certain conditions. (Rule 4-202.10). 

</p><p>There is a process for requesting access to a record, (Rule 4-202.04 and Rule 4-202.05), for requesting that a record be closed, (Rule 4-202.04 and Rule 4-202.05), and for appealing an adverse decision of either request. (Rule 4-202.07). A person may redact sensitive information from a record if the information is not needed for the case. (Rule 4-202.09). There is a process for correcting errors in records. (URCP 60 and URCrP 30).
