## Privacy Policy (Last updated August 1, 2019)

Show Page Menu

Thank you for visiting the Utah Courts' website. Our privacy policy describes how the Administrative Office of the Courts ("AOC," "we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your personal information and device information when you visit [/](https://web.archive.org/) and any subdomains and internet-accessible applications developed, owned, or controlled by the AOC (collectively "the Site"), as outlined in this Privacy Policy.

### Definitions

"Personal information" means any information that we collect through the Site that could serve to identify an individual, for example: first and last name, telephone number, physical address, email address, etc.   
"Device information" means any automatically collected information about your device, including information about your web browser and type of operating system, IP address, time zone, relevant cookies that are installed on your device, the time and date of your visit, the individual web pages that you view, the time spent on those pages, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and other statistics and information about how you interact with the Site. This information does not recognize the identity of the visitor and is not used to track or record information specific to the individual.

### We Collect Personal Information and Device Information

When you choose to use the Site, you agree to the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information and device information as stated in this Privacy Policy and any records access rules promulgated by the Utah Judicial Council (described in greater detail below). As part of court case processing, other individuals may provide to the AOC personal information about you in court records.

### Personal Information and How We Use It

The personal information that we collect is used: to provide court services to you (and other individuals involved in your court case, if any); to communicate with you; to improve and optimize the Site; and to increase our ability to fulfill our public mission to provide the people an open, fair, efficient, and independent system for the advancement of justice under the law. We will not use your personal information or disclose your personal information to anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.  


### Device Information and How We Use It

We collect Device Information using the following technologies:

  * "Cookies" are data files that are placed on your device and often include an anonymous unique identifier. These are sent to your browser from the Site and are stored on your device. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies, and know when a cookie is being sent to your computer. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our website. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit [http://www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).
  * "Log files" track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address, browser type, device type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.
  * "Web beacons," "tags," and "pixels" are electronic files used to record information about how you browse the Site.



The device information we collect serves as part of our statistical analysis about the use of the Site so we can review, design and enhance the user experience.  The AOC may detect user IP addresses for providing location-based user information and services. We do not attempt to associate device information with personal information unless explicitly stated.

### Court Records

The constitutions of Utah and of the United States protect the people's right to an open and public court. Anyone can attend most court hearings, and anyone can view and obtain a copy of most court records. However, the people who do business with the courts—parties, witnesses, victims, jurors, and others—have rights of privacy also protected by our state and federal constitutions. Neither right is absolute; each is balanced by the other.

Still, to participate in the judicial process, people sacrifice a good deal of their privacy. It is a sacrifice necessary to protect the integrity and accountability of the courts.

The Utah Supreme Court and the Utah Judicial Council have adopted rules that regulate court records. Some records are closed, but most are public ([Rule 4-202.02](https://web.archive.org/resources/rules/ucja/view.html?rule=ch04/4-202_02.htm)). Even closed records can be viewed by some ([Rule 4-202.03](https://web.archive.org/resources/rules/ucja/view.html?rule=ch04/4-202_03.htm)). Public records are provided to anyone who asks, and some public records are posted on this website. There may be a fee for access to some records ([Rule 4-202.08](https://web.archive.org/resources/rules/ucja/view.html?rule=ch04/4-202_08.htm)). Non-public records may be shared with other governmental entities under certain conditions ([Rule 4-202.10](https://web.archive.org/resources/rules/ucja/view.html?rule=ch04/4-202_10.htm)).

There is a process for requesting access to a record ([Rule 4-202.04](https://web.archive.org/resources/rules/ucja/view.html?title=rule=ch04/4-202_04.htm) and Rule [4-202.05](https://web.archive.org/resources/rules/ucja/view.html?title=rule=ch04/4-202_05.htm)), for requesting that a record be closed ([Rule 4-202.04](https://web.archive.org/resources/rules/ucja/view.html?rule=ch04/4-202_04.htm) and [Rule 4-202.05](https://web.archive.org/resources/rules/ucja/view.html?rule=ch04/4-202_05.htm)), and for appealing an adverse decision of either request ([Rule 4-202.07](https://web.archive.org/resources/rules/ucja/view.html?rule=ch04/4-202_07.htm)). A person may redact sensitive information from a record if the information is not needed for the case ([Rule 4-202.09](https://web.archive.org/resources/rules/ucja/view.html?title=rule=ch04/4-202_09.htm)). There is a process for correcting errors in records ([URCP 60](https://web.archive.org/resources/rules/urcp/view.html?rule=urcp060.html) and [URCrP 30](https://web.archive.org/resources/rules/urcrp/view.html?rule=URCRP30.html)).
