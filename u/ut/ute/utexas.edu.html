<!-- The following include is used on second level sites to create
cookie crumbs dynamically. This template contains a function call 
(BuildCookieCrumbs)
which passes the data defined in sitedata.html to the functions that are
defined in the header include. This function will build cookie crumbs
dynamically from the data in the file sitedata.html.

Note that the function BuildCookieCrumbs will only generate cookie

If you do not want cookie crumbs built dynamically, you must comment

      <h2><a name="purpose" id="purpose"></a>Purpose</h2>
      <p>The University of Texas  at Austin (U. T. Austin) is committed to ensuring the privacy and accuracy of  your confidential information. U. T. Austin does not actively share personal  information gathered from its Web servers. However, because U. T. Austin is a  public institution, some information collected from U. T. Austin Web sites,  including the summary server log information, e-mails sent to Web sites, and  information collected from Web-based forms, may be subject to the <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/business/vp/open_records.html">Texas Public  Information Act</a>. This means that while U. T. Austin does not actively share  information, in some cases may be compelled by law to release information  gathered from its Web servers.</p>
      <p>As part of its commitment to maintain  the privacy of its Web users, U. T. Austin has developed this privacy  statement. The statement has two purposes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>To educate users about privacy issues</li>
        <li>To inform users about specific privacy policies and  guidelines employed at U. T. Austin.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>U. T. Austin also complies with the <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/student/registrar/ferpa/">Family Educational Rights  and Privacy Act</a> (FERPA), which prohibits the release of education records  without student permission. Although FERPA regulations apply only to U. T.  Austin students, the university is equally committed to protecting the privacy  of all visitors to our Web site.</p>
      <p>Technical terms referred to in this document  are defined in the <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/its/policies/glossary.html">ISO Technical and Security Glossary</a>.</p>
      <h2><a name="scope" id="scope"></a>Scope</h2>
      <p>U.  T. Austin by and through its academic, research and administrative units and  programs, owns, controls, operates and/or maintains Web sites under a number of  domains (collectively, “U. T. Austin Web”). This Web Privacy Policy applies to  all domains within the U. T. Austin Web.</p>
      <h2><a name="Exceptions" id="Exceptions"></a>Exceptions</h2>
      <p>The U. T. Austin Web consists of  hundreds of Web servers. Some servers hosted by U. T. Austin may adopt  different privacy statements as their specific needs require. If a U. T. Austin  department has a privacy statement that is different from this statement, that  policy must be approved by the <a href="http://security.utexas.edu/">Information  Security Office</a>, and it must be posted on this site. However, those sites  cannot adopt a privacy statement that in any way supersedes federal or state  regulations.</p>
      <p>Approved Departmental Privacy Policies  at U. T. Austin:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/facilities/policies/web-privacy/">Computer Science  Department</a></li>
          <li><a href="http://www.arlut.utexas.edu/privacy.html">Applied  Research Laboratories</a></li>
        </ul>
      <p>The U. T. Austin Web site contains links  to hundreds of external Web sites. The university is not responsible for the  privacy practices or the content of the external Web sites we link to.</p>
      <h2><a name="Gathered" id="Gathered"></a>Information Gathered by U. T. Austin</h2>
      <p>U. T. Austin Web servers generate  temporary logs that may contain the following information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Internet address (IP address) of computer being used</li>
        <li>Web pages requested</li>
        <li>Referring Web page</li>
        <li>Browser used</li>
        <li>Date and Time</li>
        <li>UIN (unique person identifier for EID-based services only)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The data is used in aggregate by <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/its/policies/glossary.php#custodian">IT custodians</a> to tune the Web site for its efficiency and is not ordinarily associated with  specific individuals. Raw data from the Web server logs is only shared with the  custodian of each Web site. Summary reports produced from the logs help Web  publishers determine what Web browsers and pages are most popular. For example,  if the aggregate reports show a particular Web page is very popular or used  more by freshmen than by seniors, publishers might use this information to  customize the content of that page and make it easier to find.</p>
      <h3>Third-party content</h3>
      <p>Some pages within the <em>utexas.edu</em> domain may contain content  that is served from external third parties. For example, a <em>utexas.edu</em> Web site might include a graphic logo or a script from a  third party. Specifically, the following code within a <em>utexas.edu</em> page would represent an example of third party content:</p>
      <p><em>&lt;img  src="http://www.other-org.com/logo.gif" alt="Sample" /&gt;</em></p>
      <p>In this example, <em>logo.gif</em> would be third party content served from a Web server  outside the utexas.edu domain (<em>www.other-org.com</em> in this case). Third party content in <em>utexas.edu</em> is not limited to graphics, but this is the most frequent use.</p>
      <p>U. T. Austin does not transmit any  information to these third parties as part of such requests. However, when you  visit <em>utexas.edu</em> pages that contain  third party content, information such as your IP address, date, browser, and  requested page are transmitted from your computer to that third party. U. T.  Austin is not responsible for the privacy practices of these external third  parties.</p>
      <h3>Cookies</h3>
      <p>Cookies are small pieces of data stored  by the Web browser. Cookies are often used to remember information about  preferences and pages you have visited. For example, when you visit some sites  on the Web you might see a "Welcome Back" message. The first time you  visited the site a cookie was probably set on your computer; when you return,  the cookie is read again. You can configure your Web browser to refuse to  accept cookies, to disable cookies, and to remove cookies from your hard drive  as needed.</p>
       <p> U. T. Austin Web servers use cookies in  the centralized authentication system called UT EID. These cookies are used so  you will not have to repeatedly enter user names and passwords when you go to  different parts of the Web site. You are normally required to enter a UT EID  when you request data about yourself or to ensure that you are a member of the  University community. For example, students who want to check their admission  status or staff members who complete time sheets, must enter their UT EID so  the system knows who is requesting the data. This login process uses Secure  Sockets Layer (SSL) so the user name and password are encrypted between the Web  browser and our Web server.</p>
      <p>Some Web servers within U. T. Austin may  also use cookies to retain user preference information. It is against  university policy to share this information with external third parties.</p>
      <h3>Security and Accuracy of Confidential  Information</h3>
      <p>U. T. Austin does its best to ensure  that the personal information we have about you is accurate. Users with a UT  EID can check and update personal information such as their address and e-mail  address at <a href="https://utdirect.utexas.edu/utdirect/">UT Direct</a>.</p>
      <p>Although no computer system is 100%  secure, the U. T. Austin has deployed extensive security measures to protect  against the loss, misuse, or alteration of the information under our control.  These security measures and our systems are audited by certified independent  security specialists.</p>
      <h3>E-commerce</h3>
      <p>Several sites within U. T. Austin enable  you to pay for products or services online with a credit card. Unless otherwise  noted, these transactions are encrypted. It is university policy that  confidential information you enter in the transaction is used only for the  purposes described in that transaction, unless an additional use is specifically  stated on that site.</p>
     <h2><a name="Sharing" id="Sharing"></a>Sharing of Information</h2>
      <p>U. T. Austin does, upon explicit request  of users, share information with other parties and gather information from  other private data providers. For example, the university receives test scores  from testing agencies and will send transcripts to other schools. This is done  only at the request of users (persons to whom the information applies). Unless  specifically required under public information requests filed under the Texas  Public Information Act, it is against university policy to release confidential  information gathered through the Web, such as pages visited, or personalized  preferences. For example, the University's portal, UT Direct, enables users to  customize the content they see on their personal page. This information cannot  be shared with external third parties.</p>
      <p>Consistent with FERPA, we do not release  personal student information, other than public directory information, to other  parties unless we receive explicit written authorization to do so. U. T. Austin students can read more about directory information in the <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/student/registrar/catalogs/gi06-07/app/appc09.html">University's  General Information Catalog</a>. Examples of directory information include  first and last name, address, and date of birth. Enrolled students can restrict  release of their directory information by contacting the Office of the  Registrar.</p>
     <h3>Public Forums</h3>
      <p>U. T. Austin makes some public chat  rooms, forums, message boards, and news groups available to its users. The  university does not ordinarily log public chat sessions, however, any  information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you  should therefore exercise caution when deciding to disclose your confidential information  in such places.</p>
      <p>Academic chat sessions and discussion  forums, such as those in Blackboard, may be logged. However, these educational  records are protected from disclosure by FERPA.</p>
      <h3>Online Surveys</h3>
      <p>U. T. Austin is a research institution.  At any time there are numerous online surveys being conducted on the  university’s Web site. It is University policy that confidential information  gathered in these online surveys is used only for the research purposes  indicated in the survey. Unless otherwise noted on the specified survey, your  answers are confidential and individual responses will not be shared with other  parties unless required by the <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/business/vp/open_records.html">Texas Public  Information Act</a>. Aggregate data from surveys may be shared with external  third parties.</p>
     <h3>Open Records Requests</h3>
      <p>Except for educational records governed  by FERPA, all information collected from the U. T. Austin Web site, including  the summary server log information, e-mails sent to the Web site, and  information collected from Web-based forms, may be subject to the <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/business/vp/open_records.html">Texas Public  Information Act</a>.</p>
      <h3>Texas Public  Information Act</h3>
      <p>The <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/business/vp/open_records.html">Texas Public  Information Act</a>, with a few exceptions, gives you the right to be informed  about the information that U. T. Austin collects about you. It also gives you  the right to request a copy of that information, and to have the university  correct any of that information that is wrong. You may request to receive and  review any of that information, or request corrections to it, by contacting the  university's Public Information Officer, Office of Financial Affairs, PO Box  8179, Austin, Texas, 78713 (e-mail: <a href="mailto:cfo@www.utexas.edu">cfo@www.utexas.edu</a>).</p>
      <h2><a name="Questions" id="Questions"></a>Questions</h2>
      <p>If you have questions about this privacy  statement or you believe that your personal information has been released  without your consent send e-mail to <a href="mailto:security@utexas.edu">security@utexas.edu</a>.</p>
      <h2><a name="Authoritative" id="Authoritative"></a>Authoritative Source</h2>
      <p>The authoritative source on  this policy and responsibility for its implementation rests with the <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/cio/">Chief Information Officer</a>.      </p>
