**WE PLEDGE NEVER TO ABUSE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS.**  


  * We will NEVER sell or exchange users' names or e-mail addresses to any other party or organization, without the explicit permission of the user.
  * We provide a service that is free to end-users, and that is partly supported by sponsorships. Sponsor messages are clearly labeled as such, and are never separate messages.
  * To attract sponsors, we may request demographic information from our users that helps us match appropriate advertisements. However, the demographic information will only be distributed to the sponsors in aggregate form. We will NEVER release a user's individually identifiable information.  




Utne Reader Online's goal is to provide readers with the information they want and need. To do that, we may gather some general information about those who access our sites. We may place a "cookie" in the browser files of a user's computer, which will enable us to determine the user's operating system, browser type and version, Internet Service Provider, top-level domain such as .com, .edu, etc. and other such general information.

Users have the ability to configure their browsers to refuse acceptance of cookies, which are pieces of information that sites transfer to a user's hard drive for record-keeping purposes during each visit. Cookies, which do not contain any personally identifying information, are a standard industry technology. Cookies help readers by saving such information as passwords and editorial preferences on user hard drives. A cookie cannot pass on a computer virus, or even capture e-mail address.

**Personal Information**  


We will only collect personal identifying information that users voluntarily provide to us in registering for services (such as Café Utne registration, enewsletter, subscriptions, surveys and entering contests entry forms. We may use that personal information editorially to improve and customize our content or we may send users occasional promotional messages about Utne Reader and Utne Reader Online products and services. With users’ permission, we may also share our users’ personal information with reputable organizations that may contact them about products and services that may be of interest. Users can revoke their consent at any time to stop their information from being used for marketing and promotional purposes by sending an e-mail request to [**privacy@utne.com**](mailto:privacy@utne.com), or they can simply opt not to register for special services, surveys and contests.

Utne Reader Online will limit internal access to user information to employees responsible for conducting business with our customers.

Web surfers should be aware that by voluntarily disclosing personal information on Utne Reader Online -or any other site's- bulletin boards, those details can easily be collected and employed by third parties. Children should get their parents' permission before sending out any personal information, or making any purchases over the Internet.

This policy applies only to sites under the utne.com domain. We do not control the privacy policies of Utne Reader Online partner sites, those of our advertisers, or any other sites we may link to.
