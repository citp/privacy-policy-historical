					<p class="mt10">At  the Utility Warehouse, we look after all your personal information  carefully.&nbsp; We adhere strictly to the requirements of the UK Data  Protection Act 1998 and, in accordance with this Act, we are registered on the  public register of data controllers which is looked after by the Information  Commissioner. </p>
					<p>This  privacy notice tells you what you can expect when we collect personal  information about you.&nbsp; It explains the type of information that we  collect about you, and how we use and look after it.&nbsp; Please do take a  moment to read this privacy notice so that you will understand how we use your  personal information. We may need to update this notice from time to time.</p>
					<p>When  we first obtain personal information from you, or when you take a new service  or product from us, we will always ask you if you want to receive information  from us about other services or products.&nbsp; You can normally do this by  ticking a box on the application form, whether it is online or on paper.&nbsp;  If you then change your mind please contact Customer Services.</p>
					<h3 class="small mt20">Information  we collect</h3>
					<p class="mt10">When  you become a member of the Utility Warehouse and request services from us, or  request information about our services, we may need to collect certain  information about you to process your request. Also, when you contact us, in  any way, we may update your personal information or customer records. This will  allow us to provide you with a higher level of customer care.</p>
					<p class="mt10">The  information we will normally collect about you will be:</p>
					<ul class="privacy">
					  <li>Your  name, address, email, telephone number(s), energy supply numbers, payment  details and service details;</li>
					  <li>Your  transaction history and a record of all communications;</li>
					  <li>Information  about your use of our services, including usage amounts and call records;</li>
					  <li>Information  from your previous energy supplier that will allow us to take over your energy  supply, such as information about meter readings and equipment that you may owe  that supplier; and</li>
					  <li>We  may supplement the information that we collect from you and your use of  services from information that we receive from third parties. This may include,  for example, gathering your energy supply numbers from the Electricity Central  Online Enquiry Service or the GB Address Group, or validating your credit/debit  card details from a credit reference agency.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3 class="small mt20">Using  your information</h3>
					<p class="mt10">We  collect information about you to enable us to provide you with the services  that you have requested, to manage your account and to provide you with great  customer service.</p>
					<p>We  may also monitor and record any communications that we have with you, including  telephone conversations, to make sure that we are providing you with a good  service and meeting all our regulatory and legal responsibilities.</p>
					<p>If  you provide us with any sensitive information about yourself or additional  account holder (such as health details, or any criminal convictions) you agree  (and confirm that the person the information is about has agreed) that we can  use the information in the way set out in this privacy notice.</p>
					<p>If  you have given us your mobile phone number or email address (or both), we may  use the information to send you service messages or other similar information  (by text message or email). The aim is to help us manage your account. We will  not use the information for marketing purposes unless you have agreed that we  can. You must let us know if your mobile phone number or email address changes  so that we can keep this information up to date.</p>
					<p>The  main uses of your personal information are:</p>
					<ul class="privacy">
					  <li>For  credit and credit related services and to manage your account;</li>
					  <li>To  provide you with other services and updates; </li>
					  <li>To  provide access to privileged areas of the website;</li>
					  <li>To  identify other products or services that might be suitable for you;</li>
					  <li>To  create statistics, test computer systems, analyse customer information, create  profiles and create marketing opportunities (including using information about  what you buy from us and how you pay for it);</li>
					  <li>To  help train our members of staff;</li>
					  <li>To  recover debts;</li>
					  <li>To  prevent and detect fraud or money laundering;</li>
					  <li>To  update our records about you;</li>
					  <li>To  check your identity; and</li>
					  <li>To  improve and develop our services.</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="mt10">When  we process your application we may use automated scoring methods to analyse  your credit worthiness and verify your identity.</p>
					<h3 class="small mt20">Disclosing  your personal information</h3>
					<p class="mt10">There  are certain circumstances where we may need to disclose your personal  information to a third party, these include:</p>
					<ul class="privacy">
					  <li>To  verify your identity;</li>
					  <li>To  third party organisations who will help supply the services that you have  requested.&nbsp; For example, if you are an energy customer this might include  gas transporters, metering operators and our meter reading agency, and if you  are a telephony customer, this might include network operators;</li>
					  <li>To  our Distributors, where they may need to contact you to give you information  about our other services which could save you money, unless you have requested  otherwise;</li>
					  <li>To  credit reference agencies.&nbsp; We may need to make credit checks on you to  help us make decisions about your ability to pay for the services you have  requested, to prevent fraud or to recover debt.&nbsp; When we search the files  of a credit reference agency, a record will be kept of that search.&nbsp; Additionally,  details of how you conduct your account may also be disclosed to the  agency.&nbsp; This information may be used by other organisations in assessing  applications from you and members of your household; </li>
					  <li>To  fraud prevention agencies, where we have reason to believe there may be  fraudulent activity;</li>
					  <li>To  content partners or advertisers;</li>
					  <li>To  help manage any loyalty or reward schemes;</li>
					  <li>In  order to obtain professional advice, whether as part of current or future legal  action;</li>
					  <li>If  you hold an insurance policy with us, to the relevant insurer, to manage that  policy;</li>
					  <li>If  we need to investigate or prevent a crime;</li>
					  <li>If  the law permits or requires us to, or if any regulatory or governmental body  (such as Ofgem and Ofcom, or any organisation that takes over their roles)  requests or requires us to, even if you have not consented;</li>
					  <li>If  there is a duty to the public to reveal the information;</li>
					  <li>If  you have not paid any debt to us, we may use third party organisations to  pursue such debt, which may mean providing them with relevant details about you  and the debt;</li>
					  <li>If  we believe that you or a member of your household needs any extra care (perhaps  because of age, health or disability) we may share this information with social  services, healthcare and other support organisations if we believe that they  will be able to help you by making sure that there is an energy supply to your  home or to other energy suppliers, if you are considering changing, in line  with the Energy Retail Association ‘Safety Net Procedures’;</li>
					  <li>If  requested by you, to the Telephone Preference Service; or</li>
					  <li>To  your new energy supplier, information such as your meter readings or equipment  you may owe us, so that they can begin to supply your gas and electricity.</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="mt10">In  accordance with the principles of the Data Protection Act, we will not  otherwise disclose any of your personal information to a third party, unless we  have your consent.</p>
