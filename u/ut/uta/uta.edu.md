# UTA Legal and Privacy Notice – Office of Legal Affairs – The University of Texas at Arlington

## UTA Legal and Privacy Notice

### **Purpose**

The University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) is committed to ensuring the privacy and accuracy of your confidential information. This notice is provides information regarding use of UTA’s website and rights under the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).

### **Scope**

UTA by and through its academic, research and administrative units and programs, owns, controls, operates and/or maintains websites under a number of domains (collectively, “UTA Web”). This Notice applies to all domains within the UTA Web.

### **Required Link**

Each Web application or site must contain a link for "Legal and Privacy Notice" that links to this Notice.

### **Exceptions**

The UTA Web consists of hundreds of Web servers. Some servers hosted by UTA may adopt different privacy statements as their specific needs require. If a UTA department has a privacy statement that is different from this statement, that policy must be approved by the [Information Security Office](http://www.uta.edu/security/) and [University Compliance Services](https://www.uta.edu/compliance/). However, those sites cannot adopt a privacy statement that in any way supersedes federal or state regulations.

The UTA Web contains links to hundreds of external websites. The university is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of the external websites we link to.

**Information Gathered by UTA**

UTA Web servers generate logs that may contain the following information:

  * Internet address (IP address) of computer being used
  * Web pages requested
  * Referring Web page
  * Browser used
  * Date and Time
  * Other web data collectively known as “web headers” or “http headers”
  * UIN (unique person identifier for NetID-based services only)



The data is used in aggregate by IT custodians to tune the Web site for its efficiency and is not ordinarily associated with specific individuals. Raw data from the Web server logs is only shared with the custodian of each Web site. Summary reports produced from the logs help Web publishers determine what Web browsers and pages are most popular. For example, if the aggregate reports show a particular Web page is very popular or used more by freshmen than by seniors, publishers might use this information to customize the content of that page and make it easier to find.

### Third-party content

Some pages within the uta.edu domain may contain content that is served from external third parties. For example, a _uta.edu_ Web site might include a graphic logo or a script from a third party.

Third party content in _uta.edu_ is not limited to graphics, but this is the most frequent use. Examples of these third parties include social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, Flickr, etc. UTA does not transmit any information to these third parties as part of such requests. However, when you visit uta.edu pages that contain third party content, information such as your IP address, date, browser, and requested page are transmitted from your computer to that third party. UTA is not responsible for the privacy practices of these external third parties.

### **Cookies**

Cookies are small pieces of data stored by the Web browser. Cookies are often used to remember information about preferences and pages you have visited. For example, when you visit some sites on the Web you might see a "Welcome Back" message. The first time you visited the site a cookie was probably set on your computer; when you return, the cookie is read again. You can configure your Web browser to refuse to accept cookies, to disable cookies, and to remove cookies from your hard drive as needed.

UTA Web servers use cookies in the centralized authentication system called NetID that utilize Shibboleth or Active Directory Federated Services (ADFS). These cookies are used so you will not have to repeatedly enter user names and passwords when you go to different parts of the Web site. You are normally required to enter a UTA NetID or email address when you request data about yourself or to ensure that you are a member of the University community. For example prospective students who want to check their admission status, or employees who want to look at their paystubs, must enter their UTA NetID so the system knows who is requesting the data. This login process uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) so the user name and password are encrypted between the Web browser and our Web server.

Some Web servers within UTA may also use cookies to retain user preference information. It is against university policy to share this information with external third parties.

### **Web Analytics**

Some UTA websites use Web Analytics Services provided by various vendors like Google, Inc. Such vendors use cookies to collect information such as URLs, Internet domain and host names, browser software, and the date and time that the site is visited. This information is used to monitor the effectiveness of the website and to consider potential improvements to the website. The information is non-personal and is transmitted to and stored by vendors on their servers. UTA does not share any specific information about a particular user.

Please visit the following pages for more information on Google Analytics [terms of use](http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/) and Google's [privacy practices](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/). To opt out of Google’s data collection, read more about the [Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/181881?hl=en).

### **Security and Accuracy of Confidential Information**

UTA does its best to ensure that the personal information it collects is accurate. Users with a UTA NetID can check and update personal information such as their address and email address on UT Share (employees and certain affiliates) or MyMav (students).

Although no computer system is 100% secure, UTA has deployed extensive security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of the information under our control.

### **E-commerce**

Several sites within UTA enable you to pay for products or services online with a credit card. Unless otherwise noted, these transactions are encrypted. It is university policy that confidential information you enter in the transaction is used only for the purposes described in that transaction, unless an additional use is specifically stated on that site.

### **Sharing of Information**

UTA does not share your personal information with third parties except:

  * As required/permitted by law;
  * As necessary to protect University interests; and/or
  * With service providers acting on UTA’s behalf who have agreed to protect the confidentiality of the data;
  * As necessary to further UTA research efforts pursuant to approvals from appropriate data stewards and the IRB.



### **Public Forums**

UTA makes some public chat rooms, forums, message boards, and news groups available to its users. The University does not ordinarily log public chat sessions, however, any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should therefore exercise caution when deciding to disclose your confidential information in such places. Academic chat sessions and discussion forums, such as those in Blackboard, may be logged. However, these educational records are protected from disclosure by FERPA.

### Texas Public Information Act
