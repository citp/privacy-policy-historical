<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<br>
</div></div>
<div id="innercontent" class="clearfix">

<p>
BitTorrent.com, and the other websites and intellectual property and proprietary information associated therewith (the "Sites"), and the various services provided through the Sites (the "Services"), are owned and operated by BitTorrent, Inc., its affiliates and subsidiaries ("we" "us" or "BitTorrent"). BitTorrent is committed to respecting the privacy rights and concerns of all users of our Sites and Services (we refer to the Sites and Services collectively as the "BitTorrent Features"). As such, we have established and implemented this privacy policy to inform visitors to the Sites and users of the Services how we use and protect the information we collect. If you have any questions regarding this information or our privacy practices, please see the section entitled "Questions? Contact Us" at the end of this privacy policy. 
</p>
<br>
<h4>What information does BitTorrent collect and how does BitTorrent use it?</h4>
<ul>
<li>
How the BitTorrent Client Works
<br><br>
The BitTorrent Client is the software on your machine that manages downloads.  It downloads files quickly by grabbing pieces from other users.   So your use of the BitTorrent Client to download files will, in turn, enable other BitTorrent users to download pieces of those files from you.  Although your IP address is associated with your piece of the file, other users will not have access to any other personal information about you.<br><br>
<b>We do not track which files you transfer with the BitTorrent Client.</b>  Merely using the BitTorrent Client does not cause a record of your transfer history to be kept by BitTorrent or BitTorrent on behalf of any third party.
</li><li>Gathering and Use of Anonymous Information
<br><br>
Each time a visitor comes to a Site, we collect some limited information that your browser makes available whenever you visit a website to improve the overall quality of the online experience, including product monitoring, product improvement, and targeted advertising. This information includes your Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your query and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
<br><br>
In addition to collecting these types of information, BitTorrent collects aggregate queries for internal reporting and targeted advertising. We also count, track, and aggregate the visitor's activity into our analysis of general traffic flows at our sites (e.g. tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within the Sites, etc.). To these ends, we may merge information about you into group data, which may then be shared on an aggregated basis with our advertisers; but BitTorrent will not disclose your individual identity or personal data without your permission.
<br><br>
In the event that you provide us with answers to voluntary survey questions, we may present this information to our advertisers and partners, in the form of grouped statistics compiled from our users' answers to such questions. 
</li><li>
Gathering and Use of Personally Identifiable Information
<br><br>
You may visit the BitTorrent Features without any registration at all. However, from time to time, we may enable certain additional functionality to the BitTorrent Features, whereby you will have to create a user account. When you register and create an account, we may require you to provide us your contact information including your name, address, phone number and e-mail address, and other demographic information (such as date of birth, gender, age and interests) from time to time. Your user name and password will be used so you can securely access and maintain your account. BitTorrent may also use e-mail addresses and other personally identifiable information from time to time in order to gather and provide to its members and visitors improved content and features.  We also keep a record of your content downloads from BitTorrent.com and related transaction data, including payment information (if any).
<br><br>
We may use the information we collect to tailor your experience through the BitTorrent Features by displaying content according to your interests and preferences, providing a faster method for you to access your account and submit information to us, sending you information about us and promotional material from some of our partners, and allowing us to contact you, if necessary.
<br><br>
By registering for the BitTorrent Features, when applicable, you agree to receive e-mails from us from time to time. We may use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to the BitTorrent Features, new products and services available through the BitTorrent Features, and special offers we think you'll find valuable.
<br><br>
Notwithstanding any other term of this Privacy Policy, we may release any personal information we obtain or collect when we believe its release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our Site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety. 
</li></ul>
<h4>Spyware, Adware, and DRM.</h4>
<ul><li>We oppose spyware and adware.  Spyware is software installed on your computer without your consent or control.  It can record and transmit your Internet activity and other personal information or change your computer's security settings. Adware is spyware that sends you unwanted pop-ups or spam.  BitTorrent never uses these unwanted and harmful technologies and proudly and publicly stands against them.
</li><li><b>We limit the use of Digital Rights Management (DRM) technology.</b> DRM is technology designed to control access to and use of media content.  Files downloaded from BitTorrent.com utilize DRM only for commercial content published by our partners who require DRM as a condition to making their content available.
</li></ul>
<h4>How does BitTorrent protect customer information?</h4>
<p>We implement a variety of security measures to ensure the security of your personal information on our systems. User personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of employees who have special access rights to such systems. Any credit card information you supply us is transmitted and protected via Secure Socket Layer technology ("SSL") and HTTPS protocol and then encrypted into our databases to be accessed only as stated above. 
</p><br>
<h4>Does BitTorrent use "cookies"?</h4>
<p>Cookies are small bits of electronic information that a web site can transfer to a visitor's hard drive to help tailor and keep records of his or her visit to the site. The use of cookies is standard on the Internet and many web sites use them. Cookies allow web site operators to better customize visits to the site to the visitor's individual preferences. For example, by setting a cookie you would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time. We currently save password information in cookies. In addition, advertisements displayed on the BitTorrent Features may contain cookies. The companies who serve our advertisements transfer cookies independent of us, and, as such, we do not control the use of such cookies and in many instances have no access to the information collected by them.</p>
<p>Although most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, you can usually change your browser to prevent that or to notify you when you are sent a cookie. Even without accepting a cookie, you can still access many, if not all, of the BitTorrent Features. However, some parts of the BitTorrent Features may not function properly if you refuse cookies. </p><br>
<h4>Does BitTorrent disclose the information it collects from its visitors to outside parties?</h4>
<p>
BitTorrent does not currently sell, trade, or otherwise transfer outside the company personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily provide in any registration. This information is used to better understand visitors' use of the BitTorrent Features, to support related transactions made on or through the BitTorrent Features, and to better know our visitors and possibly tailor any specific features, promotions, or other notifications to them. However, this data in an aggregate form without any personally identifiable information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses. Should you change your mind about the information you've provided to us, should you no longer wish to receive information from us, or should your information change, we have provided a way for you to correct, update or remove the personal data you gave us. You can do this simply by contacting us in any of the simple ways set forth below in the section entitled "How do you change the information we have for you?" </p>
<p>Finally, we may disclose your personally identifiable information upon a transfer or sale to another entity of all or substantially all of our assets or equity securities or upon any other corporate reorganization. </p><br>
<h4>BitTorrent's special note to parents.</h4>
<p>In compliance with the 1998 Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), BitTorrent is a general audience website, and does not knowingly collect, nor will it ever knowingly retain, personally identifiable information from any visitor BitTorrent actually knows to be under thirteen years of age without the consent of that child's parent or legal guardian. </p><br>
<h4>How do you change the information we have for you?</h4>
<p>To update or modify the information that we have on file for you, if applicable, simply go to the <a href="http://forum.utorrent.com/">µTorrent forums</a>, log in, go to the "Profile" section, then modify your details and settings as necessary.</p><br>
<h4>Third party links and co-brand relationships.</h4>
<p>In an attempt to provide increased value to our visitors, we may choose various third party web sites to link to, and frame within, the Sites or Services. We also participate in co-branding and other relationships to offer e-commerce and other services and features to our users. However, even if the third party is affiliated with us, we have no control over these linked sites, each of which has separate privacy and data collection practices independent of us. Data collected by our co-brand partners or third party web sites (even if offered on or through our site) may not be received by us. As such, we have no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions, and are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any such web sites. These linked sites are only for your convenience and you therefore access them at your own risk.</p><br>
<h4>EU Safe Harbor Compliance</h4>
<p>BitTorrent adheres to the European Union Safe Harbor principles as set forth by the United States Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information covered by the Privacy Policy from the European Union.</p><br>
<h4>Notification of changes.</h4>
<p>By visiting the Site or using the Services, you consent to the collection and use of information by us as set forth in this privacy policy. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes within this page so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. </p><br>
<h4>Questions? Contact us.</h4>
<p>If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please do not hesitate to contact: </p>
<pre>BitTorrent, Inc.
201 Mission St. Suite 900
San Francisco, California 94105</pre>
<h4>Terms and Conditions.</h4>
<p>Please also read the Terms of Service establishing the use, disclaimers, and limitations of liability governing the use of the Site, the Services and the other BitTorrent services and applications. </p><br>
