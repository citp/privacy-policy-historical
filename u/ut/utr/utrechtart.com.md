For every visitor to our website, our web server automatically recognizes only the consumer's domain name, but not the email address (where possible). 

We collect only the domain name, but not the email address of visitors to our website, the email addresses of those who communicate with us via email, user-specific information about the pages accessed or visited, and information volunteered by the consumer, such as preferences, survey information, and/or site registrations. 

The information we collect may be used to customize the content and/or layout of our website for each individual visitor and to notify visitors about updates to our website.

In addition, information (including name, address, and transaction information) may be shared with agents or contractors who assist in providing support for our internal operations, and used by us to contact consumers for marketing purposes. 

##  Cookies 

With respect to cookies, we use them to store visitor preferences, to record session information (such as items that consumers add to their shopping carts), to record user-specific information about the pages users access or visit, to alert visitors to new areas that we think might be of interest to them when they return to our site, and to record past activity in order to provide better service when visitors return to our site.

If our information practices change at some future time, we will post the policy changes on our website and provide you with the opportunity to opt out of these uses. If you are concerned about how your information is used, please visit our website for periodic updates. 

##  Disclosure 

The information we collect may be disclosed when we are legally required to do so, at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation, to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our website and applicable laws, or to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our website. 

## California Shine the Light Law

Under California's "Shine the Light" law (Civil Code Section 1798.83), California residents who provide personal information in obtaining products or services for personal, family, or household use are entitled to request and obtain, once per calendar year, information about the customer information we shared, if any, with other businesses for their own direct marketing uses. If applicable, this information would include the categories of customer information and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we shared customer information for the immediately prior calendar year. To obtain this information from us, please use the Customer Service link below and then the Contact Us link, write "Request for California Privacy Information" on the subject line of your message, and we will send you a reply email containing the requested information. Not all information-sharing is covered by the "Shine the Light" requirements and only information on covered sharing will be included in our response.
