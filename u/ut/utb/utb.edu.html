<p><b><font face="Arial" size="4">The University of Texas at Brownsville</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Web Privacy Statement</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The
University of Texas at Brownsville is committed to ensuring the privacy and
accuracy of your confidential information. We do not actively share personal
information gathered from our Web servers. However, because The University of
Texas at Brownsville is a public institution, some information collected from
the UT Brownsville Web site, including the summary server log information,
e-mails sent to the Web site, and information collected from Web-based forms,
may be subject to the Texas Public Information Act. This means that while we do
not actively share information, in some cases we may be compelled by law to
release information gathered from our Web servers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As part
of our commitment to maintain the privacy of our Web users, The University of
Texas of Brownsville has developed this privacy statement. The statement has two purposes:</font></p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="
     "><font face="Arial" size="2">To
    educate users about privacy issues</font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="
     "><font face="Arial" size="2">To
    inform users about specific privacy policies and guidelines employed at The
    University of Texas at Brownsville.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The
University of Texas at Brownsville also complies with the Family Educational
Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which prohibits the release of education records
without student permission. The University of Texas at Brownsville is equally committed to
protecting the privacy of all visitors to our Web site.</font></p>
<hr size="2" width="100%" align="center">
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The
University of Texas at Brownsville Web consists of many Web servers. Some
servers hosted by The University of Texas at Brownsville may adopt different
privacy statements as their specific needs require. If another UT Brownsville
Web server has a privacy statement that is different from this statement, that
policy must be approved by the University compliance officer, and it must be
posted on their site. However, those sites cannot adopt a privacy statement that
in any way supersedes federal or state regulations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The
University of Texas at Brownsville web site contains links to many external Web sites. The
University is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of the
external Web sites we link to.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Information We Gather</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Our Web
servers generate temporary logs that contain the following information:</font></p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="
     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .5in"><font face="Arial" size="2">Internet
    address of computer being used</font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="
     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .5in"><font face="Arial" size="2">Web
    pages requested</font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="
     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .5in"><font face="Arial" size="2">Referring
    Web page</font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="

    used</font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="
     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .5in"><font face="Arial" size="2">Date
    and Time</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The data
is used in aggregate by system administrators and Web content managers to tune
the Web site for its efficiency and is not ordinarily associated with specific
individuals.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">COOKIES</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Cookies

remember information about preferences and pages you have visited.&nbsp; You can
refuse to accept cookies, can disable cookies, and remove cookies from your hard
drive. In Netscape Navigator, choose Edit and Preferences to manage your cookie

external third parties.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Security and Accuracy of Confidential Information</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Although
no computer system is 100% secure, the University of Texas at Brownsville has
deployed extensive security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, or
alteration of the information under our control. These security measures and our
systems are audited by certified independent security specialists.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">E-commerce</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The
University may enable you to pay for products or services online with a credit
card. Unless otherwise noted, these transactions are encrypted. It is University
policy that confidential information you enter in the transaction is used only
for the purposes described in that transaction, unless an additional use is
specifically stated on that site.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Sharing of Information</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The
University of Texas at Brownsville does, upon explicit request of users, share
information with other parties and gather information from other private data
providers. For example, the University receives test scores from testing
agencies and will send transcripts to other schools. This is done only at the
request of users (persons to whom the information applies). Unless specifically
required under public information requests filed under the Texas Public
Information Act, it is against University policy to release confidential
information gathered through the Web, such as pages visited, or personalized
preferences.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Consistent
with FERPA, we do not release personal student information, other than public
directory information, to other parties unless we receive explicit written
authorization to do so. Enrolled students can restrict release of their
directory information by contacting the Enrollment Office.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Online Surveys</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The
University of Texas at Brownsville conducts surveys for research purposes. At any time there
may be online surveys being conducted on The University of Texas at Brownsville
web site. It is
University policy that confidential information gathered in these online surveys
is used only for the research purposes indicated in the survey. Unless otherwise
noted on the specified survey, your answers are confidential and individual
responses will not be shared with other parties unless required by the Texas
Public Information Act. Aggregate data from surveys may be shared with external
third parties.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Open Records Requests</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Except
for educational records governed by FERPA, all information collected from the UT
Brownsville Web site, including the summary server log information, e-mails sent
to the Web site, and information collected from Web-based forms, may be subject
to the Texas Public Information Act.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Texas Public Information Act</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The
Texas Public Information Act, with a few exceptions, gives you the right to be
informed about the information that The University of Texas at Brownsville
collects about you. It also gives you the right to request a copy of that
information, and to have The University correct any of that information that is
wrong. You may request to receive and review any of that information, or request
corrections to it, by contacting the University's Public Information Officer.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Questions</font></b></p>
