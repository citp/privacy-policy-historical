<p>The University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) respects your privacy. The University's main web page does not 
collect personal information about visitors. In particular, we do not use "cookies" to collect information.</p>

<p>Personal information that you provide via e-mail or through other online means will be used only for purposes 
necessary to serve your needs. Such might include simple responses to questions or something as complex as 
considering you for enrollment in the University. The service may involve redirecting your inquiry, information 
or comment to another person or department better suited to meeting your needs.</p>

<p>We may use server logs to collect information concerning your Internet connection and general information 
about your visit to our Web site. This information may be used to analyze trends; to create summary statistics 
for the purpose of determining technical design specifications; and to identify system performance or problem areas.</p>

<p>Some web pages at UTD may collect personal information about visitors and use that information for purposes 
other than those stated above.  Every UTD web page that collects personal information will use Secure Socket Layer 
(SSL) protocol.  Each web page that collects information will have a separate privacy statement that will tell you 
how that information is used.</p>

<p class="bold">With few exceptions, you are entitled on your request to be informed about the information UTD 
collects about you.  Under Sections 552.021 and 552.023 of the Texas Government Code, you are entitled to receive 
and review the information.  Under Section 559.004 of the Texas Government Code, you are entitled to have UTD 
correct information about you that is held by us and that is incorrect, in accordance with the procedures set forth 
in The University of Texas System Procedures Memorandum 32.  The information that UTD collects will be retained and 
maintained as required by Texas records retention laws (Section 441.180 et seq. of the Texas Government Code) and 
rules.  Different types of information are kept for different periods of time.</p>

<p>The "Public Information Officer" of UTD is the Senior Vice President for Business Affairs, Robert 
Lovitt.  He is the designated agent for coordinating responses to requests for public information appropriately 
submitted to UTD.  He can be reached at (972) 883-2213 or by fax at (972) 883-2212.</p>
