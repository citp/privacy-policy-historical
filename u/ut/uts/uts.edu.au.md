# UTS: Privacy - University of Technology, Sydney

The purpose of the UTS Privacy Statement is to let visitors to the UTSWeb know what information is collected about them when they visit, how the information is used, and whether or not it is disclosed. 

## Recording your visit

When you visit the UTSWeb, UTS makes a record of your visit and logs the following information for statistical purposes: 

  * your server address 
  * your top-level domain name (for example, .com, .gov, .au, .uk, etc.) 
  * the date and time of your visit 
  * the pages you accessed and documents downloaded 
  * the previous site you visited, and 
  * the type of browser you used. 



No attempt is made to identify individual visitors or their browsing activities, except in the unlikely event of an investigation, where a law enforcement agency may exercise a warrant to inspect the University's logs. 

Some sites on the World Wide Web use 'cookies' to track visitors' access to the site. UTS does not use cookies to gather personal information about visitors, except when they are used within a specific web-based application for session-management purposes. 

## Recording your email address

Your email address is only recorded by UTS when you send the University a message, and it will only be used for the purpose for which you provided it. UTS will not use your email address for any other purpose, and will not disclose it or add it to a mailing list without your consent. 

## Collecting personal information

Some parts of the UTSWeb provide electronic forms that allow you to request particular information from the University. Personal information is only requested in order for UTS to respond to your inquiry. 

UTS does not collect or solicit any personal information via the UTSWeb which might be unlawful, unnecessary or unrelated to the functions or activities of the University, or unfair or unreasonably intrusive. 

## Publishing personal information 

UTS will only publish personal information on the UTSWeb if it has been collected for this purpose with your knowledge, or if you have consented to the disclosure. When giving such consent you should be aware that information published on the UTSWeb is accessible to millions of users world-wide, that it will be indexed by search engines, and that it may be copied and used by any web user. This means that once information is published on the UTSWeb, UTS has no control over its subsequent use and disclosure.
