# Website Privacy Statement on the Collection and Use of Information Gathered from the General Public | University of Texas System

Body

The University of Texas System Administration maintains the UT System Administration website as a public service. The following statement applies only to members of the general public and is intended to address concerns about the types of information gathered from the public and how that information is used. Employees of UT System Administration should refer to UTS 165, which outlines System Administration's internal policy for the use and protection of information resources.

Since UT System Administration is a public institution, the information we collect may be subject to public disclosure under the Texas Public Information Act (Chapter 552 of the Texas Government Code).

#### I. Information Collected and Stored Automatically

##### Cookies

A "cookie" is a small file containing information that is placed on a user's computer by a web server. Typically, these files are used to enhance the user's experience of the site, to help users move between pages in a database, or to customize information for a user. UT System Administration servers do not store personally identifiable information in cookies from pages intended for use by the general public.

Information stored in cookies by UT System Administration web servers is used for internal purposes only. It is not used in any way that would disclose personally identifiable information to outside parties unless System Administration is legally required to do so.

##### Logs and Network Monitoring

System Administration maintains log files of all access to its site and also monitors network traffic for the purposes of site management and security. This information is used to help diagnose problems with the server and to carry out other administrative tasks. Log analysis tools are also used to create summary statistics to determine which information is of most interest to users, to identify system problem areas, or to help determine technical requirements.

The following information is collected in these files:

  * Hostname: the hostname, site name, username, and IP address of the computer requesting access to the site
  * User-Agent: the type of browser, its version, and the operating system of the computer requesting access (e.g., Netscape 4 for Windows, IE 4 for Macintosh, etc.)

  * System date: the date and time on the server at the time of access
  *  Full request: the exact request the user made
  * Status: the status code the server returned, e.g., fulfilled request, file not found
  * Content length: the size, in bytes, of the file sent to the user
  * Method: the request method used by the browser (e.g., post, get)
  * Universal Resource Identifier (URI): the location of the particular resource requested. (More commonly known as a URL.)
  * Query string of the URI: anything after a question mark in a URI. For example, if a keyword search has been requested, the search word will appear in the query string.
  * Protocol: the technical protocol and version used, i.e., http 1.0, ftp, etc.



The above information is not used in any way that would reveal personally identifying information to outside parties unless System Administration is legally required to do so. Web server logs are scheduled for regular destruction in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Texas State Library and Archives Commission.
