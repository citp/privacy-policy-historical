		<b> Website Privacy Policy</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		This Privacy Policy concerns the UltraViolet website (www.uvvu.com) (the "<b>Website</b>"), which is controlled and operated by Digital Entertainment
		Content Ecosystem (DECE) LLC ("<b>DECE</b>" or "<b>us</b>").&nbsp; DECE is a limited liability company organized in Delaware, USA (company number
		4536477).
	</p>
	<p>
		The Website is primarily designed to provide you with information about the digital entertainment service DECE offers (the "Service").&nbsp; If you
		choose to use the Service, the separate <a href="https://my.uvvu.com/ssp/public/privacyStatementPage.jsf">UltraViolet Service Privacy Policy</a>, rather than this Website
		Privacy Policy, will apply to all aspects of your use of the Service.
	</p>
	<p>
		By using the Website, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy, including as they may be amended from time to time. Your use of the Website
		therefore constitutes your consent to DECE's collection, use and disclosure of your personal information&nbsp; as described herein.
	</p>
	<p>
		As the Website is updated and expanded, our Privacy Policy may change, so please review the posted Privacy Policy from time to time. DECE will notify
		you about material changes in the way we treat personal information by placing a notice on the Website or by sending you an email (if you have provided
		us your email address).
	</p>
	<p>
		<b></b>
	</p>
	<p>
		This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is part of the <a href="/terms-of-use.php">Website Terms of Use</a>, which governs
		your use of the Website in general.&nbsp; Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Website Terms of Use.&nbsp;
		Unless otherwise stated, the singular includes the plural and vice versa, reference to a person includes a legal person (such as a company) as well as
		a natural person, and the words "include", "including", "in particular", "for example", "such as" or similar shall be construed as illustrative and
		without limitation.

	<p>
		This Privacy Policy is intended to inform users of the Website about the information that is collected from them through the Website, how that
		information is used, and with whom DECE may share such information.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy is separate from the UltraViolet Service Privacy Policy,
		which governs personal information processed in connection with the UltraViolet Service.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy does not apply to your use of the

		<b><i>User-Provided Information</i></b>
	</p>
	<p>
		We will collect certain personal information from you through this Website if you want us to send you more information about the UltraViolet
		Service.&nbsp; Specifically, in order for us to send you updates on new functionalities or other information about the Service, you will need to
		register through the Website, which involves providing your first and last name, email address, and if you wish, your company affiliation (if
		any).&nbsp; We can then send you email updates about the Service.
	</p>
	<p>
		In addition, we may collect personal information from you if you choose to send it us in other ways, such as if you contact DECE via the "Contact Us"
		page of the Website.&nbsp; For example, you might provide your name and/or email address in sending a message through the "message" box on the "Contact
		Us" page.&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p id="information">
		<b><i>Information Automatically Collected</i></b>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b></b>
	</p>
	<p>
		When you use the Website, certain information is automatically collected relating to that use. For example, DECE may use cookies, "clear GIFs" (a/k/a
		"web beacons," or "pixel tags"), or similar technologies to retain information about you and your use of the Website.&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p>
		Cookies are small data files that are sent to your browser or related software from a web server and stored on your computer or device. Cookies often
		include an anonymous unique identifier and track and store your user preferences while using the Website as well as technical information about your
		use of the Website.
	</p>
	<p>
		Most web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie.&nbsp;
		However, refusing a cookie may in some cases preclude you from using, or negatively affect the display or function of, the Website or certain areas or
features of the Website.&nbsp; To find out more about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them, visit		<a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/</a>.&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p>
		<b></b>
	</p>
	<p>
		DECE may also use clear GIFs or similar technologies to enable DECE to know whether you have visited a particular web page, viewed content or received
		a message.&nbsp; A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a web page or in an
		email or other type of content or message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the Internet enabling the verification of an individual's viewing
		or receipt of a web page, content or message.&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p>
		You cannot opt out or refuse clear GIFs.&nbsp; However, where they are used in conjunction with cookies (for example, to gain an understanding of how
		you navigate through and process the content contained in the Website) they can be made ineffective by either opting out of cookies or by changing the
		cookie settings in your browser (see above).
	</p>
	<p>
		DECE automatically collects data about your Internet address when you use the Website. This information, known as an Internet Protocol address or IP
		address, is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer or device by your Internet service provider or carrier whenever you are
		online.&nbsp; If you access the Website from a mobile or other device, your unique device identifier assigned to that device or other transactional
		information for that device may also be collected.
	</p>
	<p>
All of these technologies are designed to improve and personalize your experience using the Website.		<b>By using the Website, you consent to the use of the tracking technologies as described above.</b>
	</p>
	<p id="use">
		<b><u>Use of Personal Information</u></b>
	</p>
	<p>
		DECE may use your personal information and Website usage information collected as described above to provide you with information, customer service,
		send you notices regarding the UltraViolet Service (for example, in the form of email messages or&nbsp; mailings) and otherwise to respond to your
		requests.&nbsp; DECE may also use this information for recordkeeping purposes within DECE.&nbsp; DECE may match information collected from you through
		different means or at different times, including both personal information and Website usage information, with information obtained from other sources,
		including third parties.
	</p>
	<p>
		DECE may also use personal information to analyze individual user behavior as a measure of interest in, and use of, the Website and of the UltraViolet
		Service, both on an individual basis and in the aggregate.<b></b>

		<b><i>Third Party Service Providers </i></b>
	</p>
	<p>
		In order to improve the Website and to provide you with updates and information about the Service, we may share your information with certain
		third-party service providers.&nbsp; For example, we may share general usage information with service providers who assist us with Website&nbsp;
		development or help us operate the Website, as well as service providers who may assist us in sending you materials on new functionalities of the
		Service.

		<b><i>Legal Obligations and Record Retention</i></b>

	<p>
		DECE may disclose your personal information and Website usage information to law enforcement and other government authorities, and to other third
		parties when compelled to do so by such government authorities or as otherwise required or permitted by law, including in response to court orders and
		subpoenas.&nbsp; DECE also may disclose your personal information and other information when DECE has reason to believe that someone is causing or
		threatening to cause injury to or interference with DECE's rights or property, the operation of the Website, individual users, or anyone else that
		could be harmed by such activities; as well as to protect against fraud.
	</p>

		<b><i>Business Transfers</i></b>

		transferred assets.

		DECE endeavors to protect the security and integrity of personal information collected via the Website.&nbsp; However, due to the inherent nature of
		the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, DECE cannot guarantee that any information, whether during transmission through the Internet,
		while stored on DECE's system, or otherwise in DECE's care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers.&nbsp; This includes
		information provided to DECE by email or through the "Contact Us" feature on the Website.&nbsp; In sending information in these ways, you should be
		aware that your transmission might not be secure while it is in transit, and that a third party could possibly view the information in transit.

		Union.&nbsp;
		<b>
			By providing personal information to DECE, directly or indirectly though the Website or otherwise from outside the United States, you expressly
