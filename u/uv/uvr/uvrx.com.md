Log Files  
As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the log files includes your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or Shaw Cable), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer, [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome "Google Chrome"), Opera, Firefox etc), date/time stamp and screen resolution.

Cookies and Web Beacons  
www.uvrx.com does not use cookies.  
However, we do use third party advertisements to help support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on www.uvrx.com, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites) to personalize the advertising content that you see.

You can disable or selectively turn off cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with some websites. This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts. A good option is to scan your computer for "bad" cookies using "spybot search and destroy"
