####  **PRIVACY LEGISLATION**

UOW must handle your personal and health information in accordance with NSW's  _Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1998_ and _Health Records and Information Privacy Act 2002_.  These Acts set out the privacy principles that UOW must abide by when it collects, stores, uses and discloses personal and health information.
