# Student Records Privacy Policy | Office of the Registrar

Student records are protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), federal regulations which assign rights to students and responsibilities to educational institutions regarding students' education records. The Act governs the maintenance and release of information from those records.

To see how FERPA regulations apply to you, select a category.

## Student Records Privacy Policy For Students

The University of Oregon is committed to the privacy and security of our students. The University of Oregon Student Records Policy complies with the [Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA)](http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html) \- sometimes called the Buckley Amendment - which establishes students’ rights and institutions’ responsibilities regarding the privacy of education records. It provides guidelines for maintaining the confidentiality of education records and monitoring the release of information from those records.

### Your Rights Under FERPA

As a current or former university student, [The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)](http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html) affords you certain rights regarding your education records. They are:

  * The right to inspect and review your records. You may request to review your records by submitting a written request to the University Registrar or other school official having custody of such records; 
  * The right to seek amendment of your records which you believe are inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of your privacy rights. Requests for amendment of records must be in writing and must describe the specific portions of specific records that you wish to have amended, text or instructions as to the change desired, and the reasons why the change is justified;
  * The right to restrict the disclosure of Directory Information; and 
  * The right to file a complaint with the Department of Education's Family Policy Compliance Office concerning alleged failures by the university to comply with the requirements of FERPA.



### Definition of Education Records

Education records are those records directly related to a student maintained by the university or by a party acting for the university.

### Release of Education Records

Except as provided in FERPA (see below) or other applicable law, the university will not disclose personally identifiable information from your education records unless you provide a written release containing:

  1. What information is to be released
  2. To whom the information is to be released
  3. The purpose for which it is to be released
  4. Your signature and the date signed



Faculty and staff are responsible for protecting the identity of students and keeping student grades confidential. Grades or evaluations linked to personal identifiers (names, UO ID numbers, or social security numbers) may not be publicly disclosed. Grades or evaluations may be posted only by using [randomly generated codes or numbers](https://web.archive.org/faculty-staff/random-number-generator). The return of graded papers or other assignments must also be accomplished in a manner that protects your identity.

#### _See:_ [Random Number Generator](https://web.archive.org/faculty-staff/random-number-generator "Random Number Generator")

Some records created and maintained by the university, although not covered by FERPA, may be subject to other federal and state laws or regulations regarding disclosure.

The exceptions under FERPA which allow the university to disclose personally identifiable information from your education record are stated in the [full text of the University of Oregon Student Records Policy](http://policies.uoregon.edu/sites/policies.uoregon.edu/files/uploads/OAR%20571%20-%20Division%2020.pdf "University of Oregon Student Records Policy"). The most common exceptions to disclosure restrictions are disclosures to university faculty or staff -- "School Officials” -- with a legitimate educational interest, or disclosure of personally identifiable information designated as Directory Information.

### Definition of Directory Information

Directory information includes:

  * your full name
  * mailing and permanent address(es) and telephone number(s)
  * e-mail address
  * the fact that you are or ever were enrolled
  * enrollment status (e.g., full-time, half-time or less than half-time)
  * class level and majors/minors
  * dates of attendance
  * degrees, honors or awards received
  * cumulative credit hours
  * participation in officially recognized activities
  * your status as a graduate teaching fellow and your teaching assignment, if applicable



Below is a quick reference of frequently asked-for data, and whether it is or is not Directory Information at the University of Oregon.

### Definition of School Official

A "School Official” is defined as "a person employed by the University or in the chancellor’s office of the Oregon University System; a person or entity, including a governmental entity, with whom the University or the Oregon University System has contracted [e.g. National Student Clearinghouse for enrollment and degree verifications, CollegeNET for online course evaluations]; a person serving on the University’s governing board; or a student serving on an official committee or assisting another school official in performing his or her duties."

### Directory Information Restriction

You may choose to restrict release of your Directory Information. When the release of Directory Information is restricted, the fact that you are currently a student, or have ever been enrolled at the University of Oregon, will not be released.

Once you restrict the release of Directory Information, in order to conduct any business with the university, you will need to go in person to the office involved, with photo ID, or, via mail or fax, provided a written request for release containing the following:

  1. What information is to be released
  2. To whom the information is to be released
  3. The purpose for which it is to be released
  4. Your signature and the date signed



No information will be provided via telephone. No information will be provided to anyone - parents, relatives, friends, other students, or prospective employers - who may wish to contact you or verify your student status at the university, without a written release from you containing the elements listed above.

Restricted Directory Information is made available only where an emergency is involved, at the direction of a court order, or to University of Oregon staff and faculty with a legitimate educational need to know.

#### Submitting a Directory Restriction Request

A Restriction of Directory Information form is available in the Office of the Registrar, 220 Oregon Hall. Complete the form, including signature and date, and return it in person. Photo identification is required.

Your request to place or remove the restriction is effective no later than two working days after it is received in the Office of the Registrar.

**_Note:_** Submission of a Directory Restriction form does not affect directory information already published or released.

### Restriction Duration

The restriction of information is permanent until you request, in writing, that it be removed. The restriction will remain in place even after you have stopped attending or have graduated.

### Requesting Letters of Reference or Recommendation from Faculty or Staff

Students who request letters of reference or recommendation from University of Oregon faculty or staff members need to do so in writing. Such letters or statements are most effective if they contain specific information about your academic or work performance; this type of information is considered "non-directory" information and cannot be released without the signed written consent of the student, according to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and the University of Oregon Student Records Policy.

The Office of the Registrar has composed a FERPA-compliant authorization to release form that may be used when requesting references/recommendations. The completed and signed [Student Reference Request Form](https://web.archive.org/sites/registrar2.uoregon.edu/files/pdf/StudentReferenceRequestForm.pdf) may be mailed, faxed, or sent as a PDF to the faculty or staff member from whom you are requesting the reference/recommendation.

Your request should contain the following:

  * What information is to be released (be as specific as possible)
  * To whom the information is to be released (name, address)
  * The purpose of the release of the information (application for a specific job or admission to a graduate program, for example)
  * Your signature and date



**Requests that do not contain these four elements are not in compliance with FERPA.**

Some graduate programs, scholarships or job applications require the use of their own prepared packets and may include a form which provides a place for your signature authorizing release of non-directory information. If that completed form or a copy of it always accompanies the pages to be completed by UO faculty or staff members, no additional authorization is required.

### Student Record Policy of the University of Oregon

The information provided on this web site is for informational purposes only. The complete text of the University of Oregon Student Records Policy, which takes precedence over all other published versions, is available at the [Oregon Secretary of State Archives Division](http://arcweb.sos.state.or.us/pages/rules/oars_500/oar_571/571_020.html).

### UO ID Number

The UO ID number is a nine-digit number randomly generated and assigned at the time of first admission. Your UO ID number will be imprinted on your [student ID card](https://web.archive.org/current-students/student-records#uo-id-card) when it is issued by the Card Office. UO ID numbers are releasable only to you when you come in person to the Office of the Registrar with some type of photo ID. You may also mail or fax a written request for release to the Office of the Registrar containing the four elements listed in the section of this policy headed Release of Education Records. Over the years, the university has used other methods of creating and assigning ID numbers and for some time used Social Security numbers as ID numbers. Such numbers are no longer used. For this reason, former students who contact the university for information or service may be reassigned a new, randomly generated ID number.

Students are requested to provide voluntarily their Social Security Numbers to assist OUS (and organizations conducting studies on behalf of OUS) in developing, validating, or administering predictive tests and assessments; administering student aid programs; improving instruction; internal identification of students; collection of student debts; or comparing student educational experiences with subsequent workforce experiences. When conducting studies, OUS will disclose a Social Security Number only in a manner that does not permit personal identification of a student by individuals other than representatives of OUS (or the organization conducting the study for OUS) and only if the information is destroyed when no longer needed for the purposes for which the study was conducted. By providing their Social Security Number, students are consenting to the uses identified above. This request is made pursuant to ORS 351.070 and 351.085. Provision of the student’s Social Security Number and consent to its use is not required and, if a student chooses not to do so, he/she will not be denied any right, benefit, or privilege provided by law. A student may revoke consent for the use of his/her Social Security Number at any time by contacting the Office of the Registrar, 220 Oregon Hall.

### The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)

FERPA was enacted by the U.S. Congress in 1974 and has since had many amendments. Responsibility for oversight of FERPA compliance rests with the [Department of Education's Family Policy Compliance Office.](http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/index.html)

## Student Records Privacy Policy For Parents

The University of Oregon Student Records Policy and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) provide guidelines for maintaining the confidentiality of education records and monitoring the release of information from those records.

### Definition of Education Records

Education records are those records directly related to a student and maintained by the University or by a party acting for the university. Some examples: records of grades, coursework, records indicating progress toward a degree, student financial account records.

### Parent Rights

Once a student has reached age 18 or is attending the university, all FERPA rights belong to the student. Parent access to education records is limited to information classified as Directory Information under the University of Oregon Student Records Policy. The following information is classified as Directory Information:

  * A student's full name
  * Mailing and permanent address(es) and telephone number(s)
  * Email address(es)
  * The fact that the student is or has ever been enrolled
  * Enrollment status (e.g., full-time, half-time or less than half-time)
  * Class level
  * Major/minor
  * Dates of attendance
  * Degrees, honors or awards received
  * Cumulative credit hours
  * Participation in officially recognized activities
  * For graduate teaching fellows, status as a graduate teaching fellow and teaching assignment



Parental access to other education records is allowed when the student provides the university with a signed and dated release specifying the records to be disclosed, stating to whom they should be disclosed and the purpose of the disclosure. Each instance of release of non-Directory Information requires its own separate and specific written authorization to release.

Parents are encouraged to read the Privacy Policy information provided for students, located in the first section on this page.

### Family Emergency Situations

During the 8:00-5:00 work week, if a parent, guardian, or other family member needs assistance in contacting a University of Oregon student in an emergency, they should contact the student’s complex director in the student’s residence hall if the student lives in University Housing, or the Office of the Dean of Students, (541) 346-3216, if the student lives off campus. Staff members in those offices have systems in place and work closely with the Department of Public Safety to help families connect with their students in emergency circumstances. For emergencies after 5:00 PM (or if parents or families are unable to connect with a staff member), the Department of Public Safety at (541) 346-6666 can assist.

### Public Health or Safety Emergencies

Disclosure of information from education records is allowed under the University of Oregon Student Records Policy and FERPA in connection with a health or safety emergency if the information is necessary to protect the health or safety of the student or others. Factors the University considers in determining whether to make the disclosure include:

  * the seriousness of the threat to health or safety;
  * the need for the information to meet the emergency;
  * whether the individual(s) to whom the information is released is in a position to deal with the situation; and
  * the extent to which time is of the essence.

## Student Records Privacy Policy For Faculty & Staff

The University of Oregon, in compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), is responsible for monitoring access to and release of information from student education records. Staff and faculty with access to student education records are legally responsible for protecting the privacy of the student by using information only for legitimate educational reasons to instruct, advise, or otherwise assist students. FERPA also assures certain rights to students at the university regarding their education records. These rights do not transfer to parents, guardians, spouses or other family members without the specific written permission of the student. (Please see the "Student" section of the Privacy Policy for more information).

### Code of Responsibility for Security and Confidentiality of Records and Files

Security and confidentiality are matters of concern to all University employees and to all other persons who have access to education records. The purpose of this code is to clarify responsibilities in these areas. Each individual who has access to confidential information is expected to adhere to the regulations stated below. A person who has access to education records may not:

  * Reveal the content of any record or report to anyone, except in the conduct of his or her work assignments and in accordance with University policies and procedures.
  * Make or allow any unauthorized use of information.
  * Knowingly include false, inaccurate or misleading entry in any report or record.
  * Knowingly expunge a data record or a data entry form and record, report or file.
  * Share individual passwords with any other person (for password protected data).
  * Seek personal benefit or allow others to benefit personally from the knowledge of any confidential information they have acquired through work assignments.
  * Remove any official record or report, or copy of any official report, from the office where it is maintained, except in the performance of official duties.



Any knowledge of a violation of this code must be reported immediately to the violator's supervisor. Violations may lead to disciplinary action, including dismissal. Violations can also lead to action under the State of Oregon statutes pertaining to theft, alteration of public records, or other applicable sections.

**_See also:_** [Code of Responsibility for Security and Confidentiality of Records and Files](https://web.archive.org/sites/registrar2.uoregon.edu/files/pdf/Ferpa-Code-of-Responsibility.pdf)

### Definition of Education Records

Education records are those records directly related to a student maintained by the University or by a party acting for the university.

### Directory Information

Only those records defined as "Directory Information" may be released without the express written permission of the student. Directory information includes the student name, local and permanent addresses, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, class level and type, enrollment status (e.g., full-time or part-time), academic major and/or minor, dates of attendance, the fact that the student is or has ever been enrolled, total earned credit hours, degrees and certificates awarded, honors awarded, participation in officially recognized activities, and, for Graduate Teaching Fellows, their status as a GTF and teaching assignment. _No other information contained in a student's educational records may be released to persons or organizations without the student's prior written approval._ A chart below lists information that is frequently requested from student education records and indicates whether or not it is Directory Information.

### Students with Restricted Directory Information

A student may restrict release of all Directory Information by filing a [Restriction of Directory Information](https://web.archive.org/records-privacy#Directory_Information_Restriction "Restriction of Directory Information") with the Office of the Registrar. The restriction will usually take effect immediately and in no case longer than 2 working days from the filing date. Once the restriction form is processed, no information - including directory information - is to be released to anyone, including persons claiming to be the student, parents, relatives, friends, other students, or prospective employers, who may wish to contact the student or verify their status at the University. Students who have restricted the release of Directory Information are required to present photo identification when they wish to discuss or make inquiries about their education record.

The restriction is permanent until the student requests, in writing, that it be removed. The restriction remains in place even after the student has stopped attending or has graduated from the University.

### Faculty and Staff Responsibility

You are responsible for maintaining the security of your workstation or computer monitor. This includes the responsibility for all transactions that occur under your username and password, and for all information that is released about university students. **Do not leave your workstation or computer unattended while logged in to Banner or _Web for Faculty_. Do not give your password or Personal Access Code (PAC) to another employee or student.** Violation of this regulation may revoke your access privileges.

You are responsible for protecting the education records you store about students enrolled in your classes. The fact that the student is registered for your class is non-directory information; thus you may not release a class list or even a single student's name to a third party. Other non-directory information you might maintain about students in your class includes class attendance records, quizzes and exams grades, homework, etc. All of these records are considered education records, and must be protected. Please note that education records should not be stored on personal accounts in the cloud, such as a personal Google Docs account, or an Apple iCloud account. Personal accounts are not compliant with UO's Student Record Policy; appropriate avenues for storing education records about your class are [BlackBoard](http://blackboard.uoregon.edu/ "BlackBoard") or [UO Docs](https://it.uoregon.edu/software/docs "UO Docs").

University staff and faculty members performing instructional, supervisory, advisory, or administrative duties for the University are considered to have a legitimate educational need for access to student data for students for whom they are performing these functions. Individuals without legitimate educational interest must present EITHER an appropriate written signed and dated authorization for release from the student, which must include: 1) the specific information to be released, 2) the person or class of persons to whom the information is to be released, and 3) the purpose for which the information is to be released, OR a valid subpoena or court order. If presented with a subpoena or court order, faculty and staff are to contact the University Registrar immediately. The University Registrar, in consultation with the General Counsel to the President, determines validity of and extent of compliance with subpoenas and court orders. You have the authority and responsibility to deny any request for data that you feel is not legitimate. If you are in doubt, it is always wiser to err on the side of caution than to release information that may constitute a FERPA violation.

When responding to an inquiry about a student, staff and faculty must determine whether the student has placed a restriction on his/her record. If a student has filed a restriction, records are marked *CONFIDENTIAL* and _Web for Faculty_ records include the note "THE STUDENT HAS RESTRICTED RELEASE OF DIRECTORY INFORMATION." Class lists have the symbols >> preceding the student name. An appropriate response to an inquiry about a student with a directory restriction is "I'm sorry, I have no information for a person (or individual) by that name." **Note: Use of the term "student" in your response is not permitted under FERPA regulations.** You may not respond to the inquiry by indicating that the person has restricted the release of his/her directory information.

### Posting of Grades

Faculty and staff are responsible for protecting the identity of students and keeping student grades confidential. Grades or evaluations linked to personal identifiers (names, UO ID numbers, or social security numbers) may not be publicly disclosed without specific permission from the student as described above. Without student permission, grades or evaluations may be posted, whether on office doors or on websites, only by using [randomly generated codes or numbers](https://web.archive.org/faculty-staff/random-number-generator "Random 3-Digit Code Number Generator"). Graded papers, exams, quizzes and other assignments are considered part of the student's education record, and must be returned to the student in a manner designed to maintain confidentiality.

#### _See:_ [Random Number Generator](https://web.archive.org/faculty-staff/random-number-generator "Random Number Generator")
