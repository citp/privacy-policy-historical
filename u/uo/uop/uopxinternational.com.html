  Web Privacy Statement</h1>
<p>Dragon Media Online (“DMO”) and our affiliated companies worldwide are  committed to respecting your online privacy and recognize your need for  appropriate protection and management of any information you share with us by  using our web sites.&nbsp; DMO reserves the  right to append or otherwise modify this Privacy Statement at any time, so  please re-visit this page occasionally to check for updates. <br>
  DMO has established the  following Online Privacy Policy so that you can understand the care with which  we intend to treat your information. This policy describes the overall privacy  practices of DMO regarding information we collect on our network of web sites  and through our other Internet advertising mediums, including but not limited  to email. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that DMO  does not own or control, or to people that DMO does not employ. <br>
  Information Collected by DMO<br>
  <br>
  Non-Personally Identifiable Consumer Information<br>
  <br>
  DMO collects various types of information from you to better meet your needs  and to provide you with a more relevant user experience. Some of this  information is collected automatically through cookies (a small text file  placed on your computer) or other Internet tracking technologies.</p>
<h3>Information Collected Automatically</h3>
<p>The types of information your browser or internet session automatically  sends us each time you visit one of our sites, which we automatically collect,  includes: </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Your browser, e.g., Internet       Explorer, Netscape Navigator. </li>
  <li>Your Internet domain, e.g.,       AOL, Netcom, Earthlink, etc. </li>
  <li>You computer's operating       system, e.g., Windows, Macintosh, UNIX, Linux. </li>
  <li>Your navigation path, i.e.,       the URLs of where you come to our site from, which of our pages you visit,       and where you go as your leave. </li>
  <li>Your IP Address. </li>
</ul>
<p>This information lets us see how users are finding our sites, and it tells  us which pages are visited the most often so we can make our web sites more  useful. <br>
  DMO may also contract with  reputable third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These  companies may also use cookies or other measures to collect your non-personally  identifiable information. </p>
<h3>Personally Identifiable Consumer Information</h3>
<p>In addition, at http://www.uopxinternational.com, we collect information that  you may choose to provide to us when requesting additional information from the  University of Phoenix  or the University   of Phoenix Online.  Examples of personally identifiable data that you may provide to us include  name, address, and email address. If you provide personally identifiable data  to us, you may later elect to have your information deleted from our files, or  kept from being used for purposes other than for the service requested, by  following the opt-out procedures set forth below. </p>
<h3>How Collected Information is Used</h3>
<p>The non-personally identifiable information that DMO collects is used for  marketing and sales efforts to better target advertisements and other content  in an effort to create a more personally relevant experience. The information  is also used to predict responses to advertisements, and to help determine  which ads perform best and which content is most appropriate for different  individuals. <br>
  <br>
  If you elect to provide DMO with personally identifiable information, we may  utilize such information for marketing purposes, and this use may result in  follow-up communications from DMO and from our clients. In addition, that  information may be combined with information collected from other sources to  assist with targeting ads to your preferences and behaviors, and for other DMO  sales and marketing efforts. </p>
<h3>Sharing Information with Third Parties</h3>
<p>All personally identifiable information you provide is maintained in confidence  by DMO. There are instances, however, in which your personally identifiable and  non-personally identifiable information is shared with third parties, as  described below. <br>
  <br>
  Your non-personally identifiable data may be shared with third-party partners  of DMO on an anonymous basis. <br>
  <br>
  When you request information from DMO or University  of Phoenix Online, we may transfer  that information within DMO or route your information to University of Phoenix    Online, across borders and from your country or  jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world, so that they  may provide the information on the program that you requested. <br>
  <br>
  We may also disclose information to a third party who provides substantially  similar services as the original service about which you requested more  information. In such situations, we will provide you with an opportunity to  opt-out of such sharing. Please be aware that DMO is very careful in selecting  companies with whom it does business. <br>
  <br>
  In addition to the above situations where your information may be shared with  others, there is also the possibility that DMO, or part(s) of the company, may  one day be purchased by, or merged with, another company. In the event of such  transaction, the acquiring (or merging) company will have access to all  collected personally identifiable information. <br>
  <br>
  Finally, DMO may share your information as necessary to comply with a court  order or to cooperate with government and law enforcement officials. </p>
<h1>Security</h1>
<p>Wherever your personally identifiable information may be held within DMO or on  its behalf, we intend to take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the  information you shared with us from unauthorized access or disclosure. Please  note that while DMO will make every reasonable effort to protect your  information, no transmission of data over the Internet is 100% secure. </p>

<p>You may choose whether or not to provide personally identifiable information to  DMO. If you choose to provide such information to DMO, you have the right to  tell us not to make some of the uses of such information described herein or  may have such information deleted in its entirety.

If for any reason those means are unavailable or inaccessible, you  may send updates and corrections about your personally identifiable information  to <a href="mailto:privacy@dragonmediaonline.com">privacy@dmoglobal.com</a> and  we will make reasonable efforts to incorporate the changes in the information  that we hold as soon as practicable. </p>
<h1>Children's Privacy</h1>
<p>In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA),  QuinStreet.com is not structured to attract children. Accordingly, we do not  intend to collect personally identifiable information from anyone we know to be  under 13 years of age. </p>

If you choose to use our  referral service to tell a friend about a DMO site, we will ask you for your  friend's personally identifiable information, including name and email address.  We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to  visit the site. DMO stores this information for the sole purpose of sending  this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. <br>

  Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@dragonmediaonline.com">privacy@dmoglobal.com</a> to request that we remove this information from our database. Our one-time  email to your friend will inform him or her of this fact. </p>
