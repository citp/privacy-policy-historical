# Privacy | Free Blogging Software | UWC Blog Network

Your privacy is critically important to us. At UWCBlog.com we have a few fundamental principles:

  * We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)
  * We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
  * We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.
  * In our blogging products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.



**Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:**

Creative Commons License (Note, we’ve decided to make the below Privacy Policy available under a Creative Commons Sharealike license, which means you’re more than welcome to steal it and repurpose it for your own use, just make sure to replace references to us with ones to you, and if you want we’d appreciate a link to UWCBlog.com somewhere on your site.)

Universal Wealth Creation Pty Ltd. (“UWCBlog”) operates several websites including UniversalWealthCreation.com, UWCBlog.com and others. It is UWCBlog’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

**Website Visitors**

Like most website operators, UWCBlog collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. UWCBlog’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how UWCBlog’s visitors use its website. From time to time, UWCBlog may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

UWCBlog also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. UWCBlog does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

**Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information**

Certain visitors to UWCBlog’s websites choose to interact with UWCBlog in ways that require us to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that UWCBlog gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at UWCBlog.com to provide a username and email address. UWCBlog collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with UWCBlog. UWCBlog does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

**Aggregated Statistics**

UWCBlog may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, UWCBlogmay monitor the most popular blogs on the UWCBlog.com site or use spam screened by the Akismet service to help identify spam. UWCBlog may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, UWCBlog does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.  
Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

UWCBlog discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on UWCBlog’s behalf or to provide services available at UWCBlog’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using UWCBlog’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. UWCBlog will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, UWCBlog discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when UWCBlog believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Universal Wealth Creation, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a UWCBlog website and have supplied your email address, UWCBlog may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with UWCBlog and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. UWCBlog takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. UWCBlog uses cookies to help identify and track visitors, the usage of UWCBlog’s website, and their website access preferences. UWCBlog visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using UWCBlog’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of UWCBlog’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

**Privacy Policy Changes**

Although most changes are likely to be minor, UWCBlog may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in UWCBlog’s sole discretion. UWCBlog encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a UWCBlog.com account, you should also check your blog’s dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
