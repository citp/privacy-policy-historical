## Information and Privacy Office

* * *

UWinnipeg is committed to privacy and operating in compliance with applicable legislation, including Manitoba’s Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA). This webpage provides important notice regarding the automatic collection of information from visitors to our website.

Information collected automatically from website visitors is non-identifiable to UWinnipeg, which means we cannot link this information to a particular individual. We only collect identifiable “personal information”, such as your name, phone number or email address, if you choose to provide it to us voluntarily. Whenever personal information is collected, you are entitled to receive notice of this action, including the purpose of collection and the contact information of an employee who can answer questions you may have. Some websites may also have additional privacy notices. Please read all notices carefully.

Our collection of personal information is done under the legal authority of the _University of Winnipeg Act_ and 36(1)(b) of FIPPA.  Personal information will only be retained as long as necessary to carry out the purpose of collection or to fulfill contractual or legal obligations. Questions regarding our privacy practices can be directed to the [Information and Privacy Office](https://www.uwinnipeg.ca/privacy/index.html).

## **Automatic Server Logging**

Our web servers create and store automatic logs of visits to our website. Logs contain basic information about website traffic, including:

  * the internet protocol (IP) address from which you visit our website
  * the uniform resource locator (URL) of the individual webpage(s) you visit
  * the date and time of your visit to our website

Logs are created in aggregate and we do not track or attempt to identify individual site visitors, or combine logs with other information. However, IP addresses can be linked to individuals in certain circumstances. If this is a concern to you, speak to your internet service provider or consider the use of a tool, such as a virtual private network, that will conceal your actual IP address.
