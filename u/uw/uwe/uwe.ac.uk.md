# Privacy - UWE Bristol: Website information

The University of the West of England, Bristol (UWE Bristol) respects the privacy of users of its website. This privacy policy applies to any UWE Bristol website  from which it is linked. Also outlined are special terms that apply only to Blackboard (the University's virtual learning environment). Users of myUWE should also consult our advice on [protecting your privacy in myUWE](http://info.uwe.ac.uk/myuwe/guidance/protectingprivacy.asp).

## Cookies

Please see [the University's cookie policy](https://web.archive.org/about/websiteinformation/cookiepolicy.aspx) for details of cookie use. See also, the information on tracking in Blackboard which depends on the use of cookies.

## Information you supply

As you use this website, you may be asked to provide personal information by entering it on a web page and submitting it to the University by clicking a button or link (this includes discussion boards and feedback forms). Generally, this information will be requested to help us provide a service. However, whenever you enter such information on a web page, the University has legal obligations to you about the ways in which it may use and store the data you provide. We will treat that data in accordance with current legislation and aim to follow best Internet practice. The data will not be supplied to anyone outside the University without your consent unless required by law, and when stored in a database, this will be in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. Enquiries to the University by international students are currently managed by [UniQuest](http://www.uni-quest.co.uk/).

## Information we gather

When you access a web page, information about your usage is automatically collected. This will usually include your operating system, browser, IP Address (a number, assigned to your computer to identify it on the network), the pages which you browse, the referring page that led you to the current page, your software and aspects of its configuration. This information is available to web service administrators. Some of this information is also automatically included in feedback e-mails sent from the UWE web site, but does not represent the passing of any additional information to us (and is used to help us resolve any technical issues related to your use of the site).

You are not personally identifiable as an individual from such information alone. However, the University of the West of England, Bristol may be legally obliged to release this information to appropriate authorities.

## Web metrics

To maintain and improve the quality of our website we use the Digital Analytix web metrics service provided by comScore. The Digital Analytix  Privacy Policy states that comScore "do not link IP-addresses of your website visitors to individuals" and that where measuring data includes personal data that comScore will process such data only on our behalf and will not use the data on its own behalf, nor make the data available to other comScore customers, unless the data have been anonimised and aggregated (i.e. are no longer linked to an individual or to our website).

Some UWE web pages use Google Analytics to record how audiences use the website. Google Analytics is a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses cookies to measure use of websites. See our [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/about/websiteinformation/cookiepolicy.aspx) for details.

See our [Cookie policy](https://web.archive.org/about/websiteinformation/cookiepolicy.aspx) for details.

## Personal disclosures

Please be aware that information you share via e-mail, discussion forums, or web pages could be distributed or used in ways you did not intend. For example, if you disclose your mobile phone number in an online discussion board, another user could copy that phone number and distribute it to others outside the discussion board without your permission. Similarly, if you use a discussion forum to relate a personal experience to fellow staff or students expecting it to remain confidential, it could be copied and distributed to others outside your intended audience. Please exercise caution in sharing via web pages information you would not wish to be made public.

It requires users to "log in" by entering a user ID and password when they wish to access its resources. The following special provisions of our Privacy Policy apply to its use.

## User tracking in Blackboard

If you are enrolled in a module which uses Blackboard your use of that site may be logged. Your module leader and system administrators are able to access such information as the number of times you logged onto the site, the pages you visited, and the dates and times that you visited them. Where your tutor intends to use the tracking information created by Blackboard for the purposes of assessment he/she must advise you in advance. You may wish to seek the advice of your tutor if in doubt.
