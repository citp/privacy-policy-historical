# Privacy policy - UWE Bristol: Website information

The University of the West of England (UWE Bristol) respects the privacy of users of its website.

This privacy policy applies to any UWE Bristol website from which it is linked. Also outlined are special terms that apply only to Blackboard (the University's virtual learning environment). Users of myUWE should also consult our advice on [protecting your privacy in myUWE](http://info.uwe.ac.uk/myuwe/guidance/protectingprivacy.asp).

## Cookies

Please see [the University's cookie policy](https://web.archive.org/about/websiteinformation/cookiepolicy.aspx) for details of cookie use. See also, the information on tracking in Blackboard which depends on the use of cookies.

## Information you supply

As you use this website, you may be asked to provide personal information by entering it on a web page and submitting it to the University by clicking a button or link (this includes discussion boards and feedback forms). Generally, this information will be requested to help us provide a service. However, whenever you enter such information on a web page, the University has legal obligations to you about the ways in which it may use and store the data you provide.

We will treat that data in accordance with current legislation and aim to follow best Internet practice. The data will not be supplied to anyone outside the University without your consent unless required by law, and when stored in a database, this will be in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. Email addresses supplied to the University as part of an enquiry may be used in conjunction with remarketing services (read more about remarketing). Enquiries to the University by international students are currently managed by [UniQuest](http://www.uni-quest.co.uk/).

## Information we gather

When you access a web page, information about your usage is automatically collected. This will usually include your operating system, browser, IP Address (a number assigned to your computer to identify it on the network), the pages which you browse, the referring page that led you to the current page, your software and aspects of its configuration. This information is available to web service administrators. Some of this information is also automatically included in feedback emails sent from the UWE Bristol website, but does not represent the passing of any additional information to us (and is used to help us resolve any technical issues related to your use of the site).

You are not personally identifiable as an individual from such information alone. However, the University of the West of England, Bristol may be legally obliged to release this information to appropriate authorities.

## Web metrics

To maintain and improve the quality of our website we use the web metrics services listed below:

  * Google Analytics is a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google") which records how visitors use the website using cookies.
  * If you visit our website by following a Google Adwords link, Google will set a cookie to confirm that you have used their service. The UWE Bristol website will support confirmation that the Adword has been used.



## Remarketing

We use a remarketing service to advertise to previous visitors of this website on third party websites (including Google). This could be in the form of an advertisement on a search results page, or on a third-party website that is part of the [Google Display Network](http://www.google.co.uk/ads/displaynetwork/) (or other network). See our [cookie policy](https://web.archive.org/about/websiteinformation/cookiepolicy/third-partycookies.aspx) for details.

## Personal disclosures

Please be aware that information you share via email, discussion forums, or web pages could be distributed or used in ways you did not intend. For example, if you disclose your mobile phone number in an online discussion board, another user could copy that phone number and distribute it to others outside the discussion board without your permission. Similarly, if you use a discussion forum to relate a personal experience to fellow staff or students expecting it to remain confidential, it could be copied and distributed to others outside your intended audience. Please exercise caution in sharing via web pages information you would not wish to be made public.

## Users under 16

If you are aged 16 or under, you should not enter personal information on our web pages without the approval of a parent or guardian.

## Blackboard

Blackboard is a web-based learning environment used by staff and students at the University of the West of England (UWE Bristol). It requires users to "log in" by entering a user ID and password when they wish to access its resources. The following special provisions of our Privacy Policy apply to its use.

## User tracking in Blackboard

If you are enrolled in a module which uses Blackboard your use of that site may be logged. Your module leader and system administrators are able to access such information as the number of times you logged onto the site, the pages you visited, and the dates and times that you visited them. Where your tutor intends to use the tracking information created by Blackboard for the purposes of assessment he/she must advise you in advance. You may wish to seek the advice of your tutor if in doubt.

Please note that for the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998 by logging on to Blackboard you consent to the University of the West of England (UWE Bristol) holding and processing information relating to your use of that system. This processing takes effect subject to this Privacy Policy and is conducted in accordance with the Data Protection Act.

This statement should be read in conjunction with the University's IT Monitoring Statement.

## Blackboard and email

Participation in a Blackboard course or organisation may require you to send and receive email. Your tutor may correspond with you through email and may in addition require you to communicate with fellow students through email. Your email address will also be published if you post to a discussion board within Blackboard. By participating in a Blackboard course or organisation you consent to the publication of your email address within the Blackboard system. UWE Bristol Students must not publish another student's email address without their express informed consent.

You should not use the email facility within Blackboard to email _en masse_ to your fellow students, unless this has been expressly authorised by the tutor. You are reminded that the sending of email via Blackboard is governed by the University's Email Policy.
