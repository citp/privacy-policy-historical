**SECURITY AND PRIVACY POLICY**

YOUR PEACE OF MIND

Universal Music Operations Limited ("Universal") operates this website and respects the security and privacy concerns of users of this and all its websites. We are notified under the Data Protection Act 1998 and comply with the Act in all our dealings with your personal data. 

By using the website you agree to the terms of this privacy policy. As a general rule, no personal information (i.e. name, address, telephone number, e-mail address) is automatically collected from users of this website. However, there may be circumstances in which users voluntarily supply such information and in this event, any such information will be kept secure and confidential and will be used only for those purposes made known to users at the time the information is collected, or for the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy. We will also add your registered email address and personal details to our database if you register for updates from Universal Music via Facebook Connect. We follow strict security procedures for the storage and disclosure of information you have given us in order to prevent unauthorised access. 

Personal information collected via this website is controlled by

Universal Music Operations Limited, 

364-366 Kensington High Street,  
London,  
W14 8NS. 

OUR USE OF INFORMATION AND PERSONAL DATA

The information collected is used to provide users with information on the relevant Universal Artist to customise the user's online experience and to improve the content of the website. Other uses of this information include the internal review of the web pages visited, tracking the progress and number of entries in promotions and contests, tracking the number of users of the site and where appropriate, product purchased through the site. Where users have signed up and opted in to receive information and promotions from us, the information may also be used to notify users of future Universal product releases and information on the artist concerned together with news on other Universal artists, related products and services which may be of interest to users. 

If at any time you wish to stop receiving information you can opt out or reply to the e-mail address at the bottom of each e-mail you receive from us. You can also opt out of any SMS communications you receive from us. Alternatively you can e-mail us at info@umusic.com and tell us what you would like us to do. As Universal Music is part of a worldwide group of companies, Universal Music may from time to time transfer data from the point of collection to a local Universal Music company located in another jurisdiction (including but not limited to Universal Music group companies located outside of the European Economic Area). Information will only be so transferred in circumstances where it is necessary or appropriate to achieve the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy or the purposes made known to users at the time information is collected. For example, if a user located in another jurisdiction signs up and opts in to receive information and promotions from us, Universal Music may transfer data to the local Universal Music company located in the user�s jurisdiction which may contact the user with relevant information and promotions as described above. Communications may therefore come from local Universal Music companies, be in your local language and promote localised events/promotions. You will be given the opportunity to opt out of those local communications on any email you receive from them. Please note that any transfer of data to a Universal Music group company located outside of the European Economic Area shall be made in accordance with the standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission as providing adequate protection for personal data and authorised by the Information Commissioner. No matter where your information is processed, this privacy policy will remain in effect. 

If you register for artist update via SMS to 82665 you will be registered for email and mobile updates. Please note this is a UK Only service. Texts are completely FREE to you with the exception of the initial registration text which will cost your standard network charge. To stop receiving text messages in the future all you have to do is text STOP [KEYWORD] to 82665 - the relevant keyword will have been given to you at initial registration and on any subsequent text messages. To stop receiving emails just click on Opt Out link on any of the emails you receive from us. 

PASSING OF PERSONAL DATA TO ARTIST OR ARTIST MANAGEMENT 

Where the artist and/or it's management company have entered into an agreement with Universal to have access to consumer data collected from the use of the website for future marketing purposes, we may allow access of your data to them. However, we will not do so unless they have confirmed to us that they are registered with the Data Protection Act. Should Universal and the artist part company, they may directly contact you with future marketing regarding the artist in question going forward, but at all times you will be given clear guidance on their Privacy Policy and an option to opt out of future mailings from them.

THIRD PARY COOKIES 

Some of the advertisements you see on this and some artist sites are generated by third parties. Some of these third parties generate their own "anonymous cookies" to track how many unique users have seen a particular ad, and how many times they have seen it. These third party cookies cannot be used to identify an individual user, but only for statistical purposes, for example, in providing you with advertisements that are more relevant to your interests. Additionally, the companies that generate these cookies have their own, very strict, privacy policies but we don't have access to these cookies; other than allowing them to be served, we have no role to play in these cookies at all (although we may use statistical information arising from these third party cookies and provided to us by third parties, to improve the targeting of advertisements to users). If you wish to block third party cookies, you can do so in your browser's security settings - indeed, the majority of browsers will block them by default. 

COOKIES 

Universal uses cookies. A cookie is a small text file that can be stored on your computer's hard drive. It may be stored and updated at various times as you access the website. Each time you visit the website, the server may deliver certain customised information to your computer based on the data stored in your cookie. This allows Universal to tailor the service to your preferences. You are not obliged to accept a cookie and you may modify your browser so that it will not accept cookies. If you wish to purchase any items on the Website you need to ensure that cookies are enabled. If, however, you do not want to accept cookies please use the help tools provided with your internet browser to find out how to achieve this. We never use cookies to retrieve information from your computer which was not originally contained in the cookie. We use cookies and IP addresses for system administration and to monitor aggregate non-personalised information (such as anonymous statistics related to the take up or use of services, or to patterns of browsing). Certain non-personal information about users is recorded by the standard operation of Universal's internet servers. Examples of this type of information include the type of browsers being used, its operating system and the domain names (not e-mail addresses, where possible) of users. 

FORUMS 

While the administrators and moderators of our forums will attempt to remove or edit any generally objectionable material as quickly as possible, it is impossible to review every message. Therefore you must acknowledge that all posts made to these forums express the views and opinions of the author and not the administrators, moderators or webmaster (except for posts by these people) and hence will not be held liable.

We ask that you agree to not to post any abusive, obscene, vulgar, slanderous, hateful, threatening, sexually-oriented or any other material that may violate any applicable laws. Doing so may lead to you being immediately and permanently banned (and your service provider being informed). The IP address of all posts is recorded to aid in enforcing these conditions. You agree that the webmaster, administrator and moderators of the forum have the right to remove, edit, move or close any topic at any time should they see fit. As a user you agree to any information you have entered above being stored in a database. While this information will not be disclosed to any third party without your consent the webmaster, administrator and moderators cannot be held responsible for any hacking attempt that may lead to the data being compromised.

Our forum system uses cookies to store information on your local computer. These cookies do not contain any of the information you enter on this form; they serve only to improve your viewing pleasure. The e-mail address you enter will be used for confirming your registration details and password (and for sending new passwords should you forget your current one). When you register to use and to post comments on this board you will also be signed up to receive updates about new releases, preferential ticket purchase opportunities, PA's, exclusive competitions and music downloads from the artist. The first email you will be sent will contain your username and password plus a confirmation link. If you are happy to receive the updates from the artist just click on the confirmation link within that email, if you do not click on that link you will not receive updates via email from the artist.

As a member of our artists' Community Server based forums, you will find that your username and password will work on many of our other artist/label boards. We may from time to time contact you about forum development & improvements or to introduce you to new music based community environments that Universal Music may offer in the future. 

We also recommend that you read the Safe Surf advice on all our forums before you register.
