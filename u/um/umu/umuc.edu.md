# Privacy Policy | UMUC

This privacy policy applies solely to the collection of personal information on official University of Maryland University College (the “university”) websites. Official university websites use the "umuc.edu" domain, including www.umuc.edu. Links to third-party websites are provided for convenience only and should not be interpreted as endorsement or ownership of content or policies. The university encourages website users to review the privacy policies of each website they visit.

## Non-Personally Identifiable Information

The university uses information available in website server logs, such as network connection details, IP addresses, date and time, and content accessed to analyze trends, to create summary reporting for troubleshooting or design purposes, and to identify performance or problem areas.

An IP address identifies the computer and its network connection, not the computer user. The university does not normally link IP addresses to personally identifiable information, so that the identity of users remains anonymous to the university but not, for example, the time users log on, log off, and how long they visit any one site. The university uses IP addresses to identify a user when necessary to enforce compliance with law or university policies, for purposes of system administration, and to ascertain demographics and visitor usability.

The university also uses Google Analytics and similar measurement tools to understand how visitors find university websites and content and how they interact with them. We use this information to improve the user experience on the website and to optimize our marketing efforts. While the university uses various first- and third-party tools to collect and report visit data, these data are collected to measure university website and advertising performance and to inform future content and functionality development.

## Personally Identifiable Information

Generally, the university does not automatically collect the identity of individual users of or visitors to university websites. The university uses voluntarily-provided personally identifiable information, such as name and contact information, to respond to requests for information about university services, opportunities, and events and to provide information about new university services, opportunities, and events.

If you are asked to provide personal information on a university website, you will be notified of

  * The purpose for which the personal information is collected (for example, you may be asked to provide contact information so the university can respond to a request for more information)
  * Any specific consequences for refusing to provide the information
  * Your rights to inspect, amend, or correct personal records, if any
  * Whether responses to personal information requests are required or voluntary
  * Whether the personal information is generally available for public inspection
  * Whether the personal information is made available or transferred to or shared with any entity



Unless otherwise notified, information provided to the university may be shared among offices within the university and with the University System of Maryland and outside entities as necessary or appropriate in the conduct of legitimate university business and consistent with applicable law. Because the university is a State educational institution, such information may also be subject to disclosure under the [Maryland Access to Public Records Act (Public Records Act)](http://www.oag.state.md.us/Opengov/pia.htm). Individuals may inspect and/or correct their personal information as provided by the Public Records Act or applicable university policy.

## Enrolled Student Information

Personally identifiable information about enrolled students is protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, also known as FERPA, administered by the U.S. Department of Education. Learn more about UMUC’s compliance with FERPA in [Policy 210.14—Disclosure of Student Records](https://web.archive.org/administration/policies-and-reporting/policies/academic-affairs/student-records-disclosure.cfm).

The university websites, Google Analytics, and selected third-party online advertising networks store small fragments of text, called cookies, in the visitor's web browser with limited information such as how the visitor was directed to the website (for example, from an advertisement), which advertisement was displayed to the visitor, whether the visitor has submitted a form, or how recently the visitor last accessed university websites.

The university uses these cookies to measure the performance of university websites and advertising, to provide interest-based advertising messages, and to inform development of new content, functionality, or services.

## Data Security

The university strives to implement security measures that protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of data collected. The university maintains a [computer security policy](https://web.archive.org/administration/policies-and-reporting/policies/fiscal-and-business-affairs/computer-security.cfm).  


Not all transmissions to and from university websites are secure; some website pages may not encrypt or decrypt data sent to or from the website.
