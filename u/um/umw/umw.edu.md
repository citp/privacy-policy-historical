## How the Collected Information is Used 

Routing information is used to route the requested Web page to your computer for viewing. We send the requested Web page and the routing information to our Internet service provider or other entities involved in transmitting the requested page to you. We do not control the privacy practices of those entities. Essential and nonessential technical information helps us respond to your request in an appropriate format, or in a personalized manner, and helps us plan Web site improvements. 

Optional information enables us to provide services or information tailored more specifically to your needs or to forward your message or inquiry to another entity that is better able to do so, and also allows us to plan Web site improvements. 

We may keep your information indefinitely, but we ordinarily delete the transaction routing information from our Web server within 60 days after the Web page is transmitted and do not try to obtain any information to link it to the individuals who browse our Web site. However, on rare occasions when a "hacker" attempts to breach computer security, logs of routing information are retained to permit a security investigation and in such cases may be forwarded together with any other relevant information in our possession to law enforcement agencies. We use this transaction routing information primarily in a statistical summary type format to assess site content and server performance. We may share this summary information with our business partners when needed. 

Optional information is retained in accordance with the records retention schedules at the Library of Virginia. 

Under the "Virginia Freedom of Information Act," any records in our possession at the time of a "Freedom of Information Request" might be subject to being inspected by, or disclosed to, members of the public. However, all identifiable confidential/personal information will be removed prior to releasing the routing information.

Failure of your browser to provide nonessential technical information will not prevent your use of our Web site, but may prevent certain features from working. Failure to provide optional information will mean that the particular feature or service associated with that part of the Web page will be unavailable to you.
