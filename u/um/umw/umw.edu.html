        <h1>Internet Privacy Policy Statement </h1>
        <p>The following information explains the Internet Privacy Policy that 
          the University of Mary Washington has adopted for our Web site.</p>
        <h2>Virginia Law </h2>
        <p>We protect our records in accordance with our obligations as defined 
          by applicable Virginia statutes, including, but not limited to, the 
          "Virginia Privacy Protection Act of 1976," the "Virginia 
          Freedom of Information Act," and by any applicable U.S. federal 
          laws. </p>
        <h2>UMW EDITORIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND Links to Other Web Sites </h2>
        <p>The University assumes editorial responsibility for official University of Mary Washington web sites and official UMW on-line resources, which are defined as the official web pages or on-line materials of UMW departments, divisions and other units. For these sites and resources, UMW is the content provider and not a content-neutral Internet Service Provider (ISP). You may also find within the UMW domain -- signified by the address "umw.edu" or within the range of Internet protocol addresses assigned to the University -- web sites or on-line materials over which the University has no editorial responsibility or control. Such sites include but are not limited to the web pages or other on-line materials of individual faculty members or students, individual class sites and materials, and the web pages or on-line materials of student organizations and other organizations not formally a part of the University. For these sites and materials, UMW is a content-neutral ISP and is not responsible for the content, privacy practices or policies of those who operate those sites.</p>
        <p>Our Web site may contain links to other public or private entities' 
            Web sites. the University of Mary Washington is not responsible for 
            the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. It is recommended 
            that users read the individual privacy policy statements of each Web 
            site when they leave a the University of Mary Washington server. </p>
        <h2>Information We Collect </h2>
        <p>When you access the University of Mary Washington "official" Web site(s), the routing 
          (or client) information, along with essential and nonessential technical 
          information listed below, is automatically collected. No other information 
          is collected through our Web site except when you deliberately decide 
          to send it to us (for example, by clicking on a link to send us an email). 
          The information you might choose to send us is listed below as "optional 
          information." </p>
        <p>Routing, or client, information: The Internet domain and Internet address 
          of the computer you are using. </p>
        <p>Essential technical information: Identification of the page or service 
          you are requesting, type of browser and operating system you are using; 
          and the date and time of access.Nonessential technical information. 
          The Internet address of the Web site from which you linked directly 
          to our Web site, and the "cookie information" as described 
          below.Optional information. When you send us an email, your name, email 
          address, and the content of your email; when you fill out online forms, 
          all the data you choose to fill in or confirm; and data that you choose 
          to send to Administrative Systems is stored in a secure environment, 
          protected from unauthorized access or disclosure. For those applications 
          that process credit card payments, credit card number and expiration 
          date are encrypted using a secure server for maximum security. Credit 
          card numbers are stored on servers that are inaccessible from the Internet.        </p>
        <p>Cookies. Our Web site may place a "cookie" on your computer, 
          unless your browser is set to reject cookies. These cookies enable our 
          Web site to recognize you when you return to the Web site at a later 
          date or time and enables us to personalize the Web site with preferences 
          or information you have provided during prior sessions. The cookie information 
          placed on your computer could include the following: IP address, browser 
          type, operating system, the date and time, whether or not you have visited 
          a Web site before, where you went when you visited that Web site, and 
          any preferences or customization that you might have set (including 
          username and passwords). </p>
        <h2>How the Collected Information is Used </h2>
        <p>Routing information is used to route the requested Web page to your 
          computer for viewing. We send the requested Web page and the routing 
          information to our Internet service provider or other entities involved 
          in transmitting the requested page to you. We do not control the privacy 
          practices of those entities. Essential and nonessential technical information 
          helps us respond to your request in an appropriate format, or in a personalized 
          manner, and helps us plan Web site improvements. </p>
        <p>Optional information enables us to provide services or information 
          tailored more specifically to your needs or to forward your message 
          or inquiry to another entity that is better able to do so, and also 
          allows us to plan Web site improvements. </p>
        <p>We may keep your information indefinitely, but we ordinarily delete 
          the transaction routing information from our Web server within 60 days 
          after the Web page is transmitted and do not try to obtain any information 
          to link it to the individuals who browse our Web site. However, on rare 
          occasions when a "hacker" attempts to breach computer security, 
          logs of routing information are retained to permit a security investigation 
          and in such cases may be forwarded together with any other relevant 
          information in our possession to law enforcement agencies. We use this 
          transaction routing information primarily in a statistical summary type 
          format to assess site content and server performance. We may share this 
          summary information with our business partners when needed. </p>
        <p>Optional information is retained in accordance with the records retention 
          schedules at the Library of Virginia. </p>
        <p>Under the "Virginia Freedom of Information Act," any records 
          in our possession at the time of a "Freedom of Information Request" 
          might be subject to being inspected by, or disclosed to, members of 
          the public. However, all identifiable confidential/personal information 
          will be removed prior to releasing the routing information. </p>
        <h2>Choice to Provide Information </h2>
        <p>There is no legal requirement for you to provide any information at 
          our Web site. However, our Web site will not work without routing information 
          and the essential technical information. Failure of your browser to 
          provide nonessential technical information will not prevent your use 
          of our Web site, but may prevent certain features from working. Failure 
          to provide optional information will mean that the particular feature 
          or service associated with that part of the Web page will be unavailable 
          to you. </p>
        <h2>Customer Comments or Review </h2>
        <p>If you have questions about this privacy statement or the practices 
          of this Web site, or if you choose to review or correct any information 
          you previously submitted, please contact the Webmaster. </p>
