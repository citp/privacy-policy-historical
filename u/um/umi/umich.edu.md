  * Communicate with our students, faculty, employees, suppliers, partners, and others about how we use personal information in our day-to-day operations.
  * Provide opportunities to control your personal information, as permitted by applicable United States and other laws.
  * Integrate privacy in the design of our activities when that involves the use of personal data.
