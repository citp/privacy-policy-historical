In addition to the rights granted under the section below entitled, “Data Collected by Umbel,” some international users (including those whose information we collect under the Privacy Shield) have certain legal rights to access certain information we hold about them and to amend such information or obtain its deletion. To exercise those rights, these users may contact us at [privacy@mvpindex.com](mailto:privacy@mvpindex.com) with their request.

**Let us tell you a little about us…  **

Umbel is a Data Management Platform built and maintained in Austin, Texas. Any requests or questions relating to data collection can be directed to our Privacy Officer, at [privacy@mvpindex.com](mailto:privacy@mvpindex.com).

**Here’s the information we collect about you:**

Umbel collects name, email, phone number, company/title, and country/state data from anyone interested in our content, webinars, promotions, or demos of the platform.

**Here’s how we use that information:**

Umbel uses the data you give us to provide access to the webinars, events, and content (newsletters, blog content, tips, guides, and promotions) you’ve requested. We also use it to contact you with information about future events, webinars, content, and solutions Umbel can provide your business through our direct marketing and sales channels.

**Here’s how we store and secure it:**

The data we collect is processed, stored, and secured by partners who take your privacy as seriously as we do. Umbel vets it’s partners and vendors on at least an annual basis to validate they meet our security standards in terms of data protection.

**Do we share or transfer it?**

Umbel does not transfer personal data to other third-party controllers or countries outside of the US or the Union.

**Here’s what you are consenting to:**

By consenting, you agree to share name, email, phone number, and professional details with Umbel to send content, event information, offers, opportunities, and direct marketing initiatives. By consenting, you verify you are above the age of legal consent in your country of origin. Umbel maintains the right to reach out for any those reasons until you opt out of future correspondences or until no new events or content are being generated and Umbel is no longer accepting new clients. You may withdraw consent or unsubscribe from content at any time.

**Here’s how you control your data:**

If you ever wish to change consent or the personal data you’ve shared with us, there are a few different rights you can exercise free of charge. Umbel will respond to a request within 30 days of receipt via the same form of communication Umbel received the request. Let’s break down your rights and how we service each of them.

_Right of Access:_  You have the right to obtain from Umbel confirmation as to whether or not your personal data is being processed, as well as access to the personal data where that is the case. Additionally, you can request the purpose of processing, the categories of data collected, the categories of personal data that is not collected, any recipients to whom the data will be disclosed, the existence of the right to rectification or erasure, the existence of the right to lodge a complaint, and the existence of any automated decision-making.

_Right to Rectification:_  You have the right to obtain from Umbel the rectification of inaccurate personal data. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, you have the right to have incomplete personal data completed by providing a supplementary statement to Umbel.

_Right to Erasure:  _You have the right to have personal data concerning you erased from Umbel’s data stores without undue delay. Additionally, Umbel is obligated to erase personal data without undue delay if:

  1. the personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected;
  2. you withdraws consent and there is no other legal ground for the processing;
  3. you object to the processing and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing;
  4. the personal data has been unlawfully processed;
  5. the personal data has to be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject;



_Right to Restriction of Processing:  _You have the right to restrict processing of your personal data. Umbel exposes this through our “Edit Preferences” setting in email correspondence. At your request, Umbel can make these changes to your preferences on your behalf as well. Just shoot us an email at [privacy@mvpindex.com ](mailto:privacy@mvpindex.com)

_Right to Data Portability:  _You have the right to request your personal data be ported over to another controller. However, the breadth of personal data stored in Umbel is limited, and does not justify the technical means to port the information in an automated fashion, so Umbel will recommend we delete your personal information instead. If you really want it transferred to another party, we’ll email data fields directly to the new controller and let you know via email or via the same channel the request was made through when it is complete.

_Right to Object:_  You have the right to object to the processing of personal data at any time if you believe data was collected unlawfully. Our team will work with the you directly to investigate the claim and take appropriate action. While the claims are under investigation, the your data will be deleted from Umbel’s stores. If you’d like, you may re-submit your data for access to Umbel content at any time. Additionally, you have the right  to lodge a complaint with the Supervisory Authorities.

To exercise any of these rights you can email us at [privacy@mvpindex.com](mailto:privacy@mvpindex.com). We’ll get back to you on your request ASAP.
