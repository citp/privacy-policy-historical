#### Information You Provide Us

If you email us through any of the contact us links on our Website, if you submit a request for information through our Website or if you submit a support ticket through our Website we may ask you for Personal Information including but not limited to your name and email address in order to respond to your questions, comments and requests. If you choose to correspond with us via email, we may retain the content of your email messages, your email address and our correspondence with you. If you register for an account, we will also collect Personal Information such as your name, email address, billing address and credit card information.

#### Service Usage Information

When you use our Services, OpenDNS stores certain DNS, IP address and related information about you to improve the quality of our Service, to provide you with Services and for internal business and analysis purposes. For example, OpenDNS runs a Domain Name System (DNS) service. DNS translates a domain name (e.g., http://www.example.com) into the corresponding numerical address (e.g., 192.0.34.166) that allows your system to access the domain over the network.

#### Tracking Technologies

Technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by OpenDNS and our partners, affiliates, or analytics or service providers (including Optimizely, Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Crazy Egg, New Relic, Inspectlet, Bizo, Google Adwords, Doubleclick, Rubicon, Olark, Bizible, Salesforce, Marketo, Reachforce, Facebook, Google+, Twitter, Disqus, Scorecard Research, ShareThis and Customer.io). These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.

We may use “cookies” on or in conjunction with our Websites to help OpenDNS identify and track visitors, their usage of our Websites, and their website access preferences. A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. If you do not wish to have cookies placed on your computer you should set your browser to refuse cookies before using the Websites, with the drawback that certain features of the Websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any Personal Information you submit while on our Websites.

As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We do not link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you.

We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our Websites or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking [here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/) (or if located in the European Union click [here](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/)). Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to receive generic ads.

We use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML5 to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML 5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs.

#### Chat Rooms, Discussion Forums, Bulletin Boards

If you participate in one of our chat rooms, discussion forums, or post messages to a Website bulletin board, you should be aware that the information disclosed and shared will be broadly available to other persons, both inside of and/or outside of OpenDNS, who have access to that chat room, forum or bulletin board. Please be careful and responsible whenever you’re online by not posting any more Personal Information than you want revealed. In addition, if you post Personal Information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Please also note that a participant’s expressed opinion is his or her own and should not be considered to reflect the opinion of OpenDNS. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at [contact@opendns.com](mailto:contact@opendns.com). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

Our blog is also managed by a third party application that may require you to register to post a comment. We do not have access or control of the information posted to the blog. You will need to contact or login into the third party application if you want the personal information that was posted to the comments section removed. To learn how the third party application uses your information, please review their privacy policy.
