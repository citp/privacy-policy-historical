### Collecting, Using and Disclosing Personal Information

  * **Information Collected**

The University web sites may collect personal information such as name, address, e-mail address, telephone number(s), and/or educational interests. Such personal information may be requested by us in respect of research, teaching, public service, and/or for administrative purposes.

Web servers typically collect, at least temporarily, the following information: Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer being used; the web pages requested; the date and the time of your visit to the site; the type of browser that is being used. The University may collect statistics identifying particular IP addresses from which our web sites are accessed as well as the usage of our web sites.

  * **Use and Disclosure of Collected Information**

If you provide personal details during your visit to the University web sites, then we will only use and disclose your personal information for the purpose for which it was collected. Any other type of use and disclosure will require your prior and definite consent, or be in accordance with privacy law.

  * **Security**

The University of Macau web sites use the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect the transmission of sensitive personal information over the Internet. Usernames and passwords may be required before personal information (such as exam results) is published on the web site. This is to ensure that information is displayed only to the intended person. 

Although every effort is made to secure network communications, the University cannot ensure the privacy of online communications. Individuals using online services should also take steps to protect personal information, such as closing the web browser when finished using the site, ensuring your password is kept securely and not disclosed to anyone else. If you have concern about conveying your personal information over the Internet, then you may wish to contact the University by telephone or mail.
