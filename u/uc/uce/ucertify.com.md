** ** **Our Commitment:**  
  
We are committed to protecting your privacy. We assure you that the personal information you provide to uCertify over the internet is treated with utmost care to ensure safety, security and confidentiality. 

uCertify does not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise provide customer identifiable information to third parties (except as required by subpoena, search warrant or other legal process). It may, however, provide this information to its affiliated companies in an effort to serve you better.  
  
   
**Cookies:**  
  
uCertify uses "cookies" to allow customers to add items to the "basket", to travel to other pages within the site, and then to return to find their basket contents intact. Cookies are also used to make sure that your order information is moved to our secure server correctly. Therefore, two things are true about cookies. One, you must "allow" cookies for the basket to work -- and thus to be able to purchase products online. Two, the cookies will expire after your close/quit your browser.
