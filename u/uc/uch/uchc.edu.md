On November 4, 2013, the UConn Health Center became aware that an employee inappropriately accessed electronic medical records of 164 patients. The improperly accessed information may have included names, addresses, dates of birth, social security numbers, and diagnosis and treatment information. We have no evidence to suggest any patient health information has been misused or misappropriated. We take our obligation to safeguard patient personal information seriously, and we sincerely regret this incident and apologize for any inconvenience this has cause our patients and their families.

The Health Center has taken the following action to inform and protect patients affected by this breach: 

  1. We notified patients by letter on November 27, 2013. 
  2. We arranged for credit monitoring service and identity theft insurance for each patient, for a period of two years at our expense. This service will be provided by AllClear ID and be of no cost to patients. 
  3. The toll-free phone number for affected patients to contact AllClear ID is 1-877-615-3749. AllClear maintains an A+ rating at the Better Business Bureau. 



While written notification was mailed to each patient using the most current contact information, we are posting this additional notice to provide information to 10 to 15 patients whose letters were returned by the U.S. Postal Office, and for whom no forwarding address or telephone contact information could be determined. 

It is important to know that all Health Center employees are required to undergo training about patient privacy upon employment, and education is reinforced with ongoing training. The Health Center continues to investigate this matter and the employee in question has been placed on administrative leave. 

If you have questions about whether your information may have been breached in this incident, please contact AllClear ID at the toll free number: 1-877-615-3749. 

We sincerely regret any inconvenience or concern caused by this incident. 

Sincerely,
