In addition, visitors to UCreative.com will need to register for a UCreative.com Login user ID and password to use many of the interactive features on UCreative.com as well as to make a purchase or file an order from UCreative.com. Log file data and other information gathered from registered users of UCreative.com are used to improve the UCreative.com customer experience.</p>

<p><strong>Visitor Information</strong></p>
<p>The UCreative.com web server uses an extended log file format which captures: date and time of visit, referring address (location from which a visitor comes to UCreative.com), type of Internet browser, and visitor’s IP address. (Each computer that connects to the Internet is assigned a unique number, an IP address, for identification purposes). The log file does not capture a visitor’s email address.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>Certain areas of UCreative.com ask for personal information. UCreative.com uses this personal information to aid in presenting its customers with a better interactive experience and to facilitate the customer’s ability to make purchases and orders from the UCreative.com website. To register for a login user ID, your name, address, email address, billing information, and business profile are requested. This information is collected to help us further develop our services, to provide you access to valuable UCreative.com Internet-based information and services, and to facilitate the billing process for those services if you elect to use them. Customers will have the ability to access and change the information which they have provided to UCreative.com by use of the appropriate features on the UCreative.com website.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>The information collected through this site helps us identify the type of web site content that our customers value, allowing us to market and improve the web site and our services. The information is also used to send email notifications to customers about updates to the web site, and to contact customers by other means for marketing and other purposes. Our policy is to not give, sell or otherwise distribute the information collected through this site to third parties outside of Digital Room, Inc. and its subsidiaries (unless required by law); provided, however, in some cases we may use suppliers to assist us in collecting, using or otherwise processing for our benefit the information obtained through this site. UCreative.com does use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. Our practice is to require our suppliers and vendors to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with this policy and our requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Information From Third Parties</strong></p>
<p>If necessary, UCreative.com obtains consumer information from third-party providers in order to improve the accuracy of our customer database and to increase our understanding of our customers or to identify potential customers. For example, we get updated addresses from the National Change of Address (NCOA) service to assist us in having the correct addresses for our customers.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>A cookie is a series of data characters that, when programmed into a web site, is placed by the web server into the browser’s application folder on your computer. Once placed onto your machine, the cookie will allow the web site to “recognize” you as a unique individual. UCreative.com uses these Coolies to personalize information for certain segments of its customer base. Secondly, in some instances, cookies are used to allow UCreative.com the opportunity to associate individual customers with their information profiles. For example, through the use of cookies, UCreative.com can “remember” your user ID when you login to UCreative.com on your computer. Should you choose to do so, cookies can be removed from your hard drive and certain web browsers can be set so that cookies are not used or saved. Please check with your browser provider for more information on removing cookies.</p>

We encourage our users to be aware of this fact when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that they visit which collects personally-identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this web site.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>For the safety of our customers who are shopping online, UCreative.com always has security measures in place to protect customer information. UCreative.com takes all reasonable precautions to protect against the loss, misuse and unauthorized access of your personal information under our control. Because the security of your personal information is a high priority, we have taken numerous steps to ensure that it is processed confidentially, accurately and securely. The UCreative.com web site uses encryption technology, such as Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, which is supported by the vast majority of modern Internet browsers. SSL technology represents the highest level of security available on the Internet, automatically encrypting information traveling over the Internet, verifying the identity of the transacting servers through certificates and digital signatures, and confirming that the integrity of the message content is maintained throughout its transmission. UCreative.com cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us by e-mail, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
