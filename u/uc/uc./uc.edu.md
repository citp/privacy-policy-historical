The University of Cincinnati (UC) recognizes the importance of privacy and is committed to protecting the personal data of our students, faculty, staff, alumni and guests.  This Privacy Statement explains the type of personal data UC collects and how that data is used.

## **Where UC Obtains Personal Data**

### **From You Or At Your Direction**

UC receives personal data from multiple sources, most often directly from you or from a third party whom you have directed to provide information to UC (e.g., application for admission to UC through the use of CollegeNet or the Common App). ****

### **Publicly Facing Technology Services**

The university’s publicly facing technology services (ex.: websites, student information system, learning management system, and similar) collect personal information that you knowingly and voluntarily provide when completing applications and forms, sending emails, registering for classes or other programs, responding to surveys, or ordering merchandise. Your personal information can be used to provide you with the needed information, products or services, as well as helping to enhance your experience with the university’s resources and technology services.

If you visit our websites, we automatically gather and store the following information about your visit so that we can track the use of our websites to make improvements. This automatically collected information is stored and used in the aggregate only, and is generally not used to contact you personally.  Examples of the data stored and used to enhance your experience are:

  * The IP address from which you access our website
  * The name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for example, aol.com, if you are connecting from an America Online account)

The university’s website uses cookies to personalize its content and enhance your experience accessing technology services.

## **Linking**

Within our website there are links to third-party websites. When you link to third-party websites, you leave UC's website and no longer will be subject to our privacy policy. UC is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of third-party websites, and such links are not intended to be an endorsement of those sites nor their content.

## **How We Use Personal Data**

In order for UC to achieve its core mission, it is essential and necessary for UC to process personal data of its students, employees, applicants, research subjects, alumni and others involved in our educational, research, service and community programs.  UC processes personal information for various lawful reasons, including, without limitation:

UC also complies with the applicable provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) where relevant and appropriate.

UC will comply with its published data protection policies in the processing of your personal data, except for legally permitted exceptions.  Please see UC’s Office of Information Security website for related policies and further detail.

If you have specific questions regarding the collection and use of your personal data, please contact the Director of Privacy within the Office of General Counsel.

## **Data Retention**

Generally, UC retains data it collects as specified in its General Records Retention Schedule.

## **European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**

The EU GDPR provides broad privacy protections to individuals physically located in the European Economic Area (EEA) (data subject(s)).  Under certain circumstances, the GDPR may apply to UC activities in the EEA, for example, when a student attends a study abroad program in the EEA or when a faculty member is temporarily assigned to work on behalf of UC in the EEA.  When subject to the GDPR, UC will comply with the regulation's core privacy principles.

### **GDPR Lawful Bases for Processing Personal Data**

Under the GDPR, UC must have a lawful basis to process a data subject's personal data. Although there will be some instances where the processing of personal data will be pursuant to other lawful bases (e.g., processing necessary to protect the vital interests or safety of a data subject, processing related to legal action involving the university, etc.), the following lawful bases will apply to most UC data processing activities:

  * Processing for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by UC or by a third party;
  * Processing for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;
  * Processing for compliance with a legal obligation to which UC is subject; and
  * Processing pursuant to the consent of a data subject for one or more specific purposes.



**GDPR Individual Rights of the Data Subject**

Subject to all other applicable laws and regulations, including all laws of the United States and the State of Ohio, where legally applicable, certain data subjects have the following rights under the GDPR:

  * To access the personal data we maintain about you;
  * To be provided with information about how we process your personal data;
  * To correct or modify your personal data;
  * To have your personal data deleted;
  * To object to or restrict how we process your personal data;
  * To request your personal data to be transferred to a third party; and
  * To file a complaint.



Please be aware that under certain circumstances, the GDPR or other applicable laws may limit a data subject's exercise of the above rights. To exercise the above rights, data subjects should contact Privacy@uc.edu. Please note that exercising these rights is not a guarantee of a requested outcome.
