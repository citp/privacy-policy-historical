### 10\. Advertisements and Third Party Websites

Our Sites may contain links to other websites.  We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.  We may allow third-party advertisers to place ads on our Sites.  These third-party advertisers may use cookies or similar technologies to help present the advertisements to you or to help measure the effectiveness of their advertisements.  Some advertisers may use cookies to serve ads based on your visits to the Sites and other websites on the Internet.  The use of such technologies is subject to the privacy policies of the third-party advertisers and is not covered by this Privacy Policy.  As a result, if you respond to any such third-party advertisers by clicking on the advertisements and/or visiting their websites or the websites of any other third party, be sure you evaluate their privacy policies before providing them any of your information.  To opt-out of a third party’s use of cookies, you must visit such third party’s website and follow its specified opt-out procedures.  You can learn more about one of our partners, Google, and how they use your data by visiting: <http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/partners/>.  You may opt-out of Google’s use of the DoubleClick cookie by visiting the Google Advertising Policies and Principles page at <http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/>.  You can opt out of some, but not all, third-party advertiser cookies in one location at the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out website, located at [www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).  You may block all cookies by following the instructions applicable to your browser at <http://www.aboutcookies.org/page-1>.

This hashed version of your email address is a text string that uniquely identifies your email address, but which is designed to prevent reverse engineering so that a third party should be unable to utilize the actual underlying email address, but merely to identify you as a unique user across devices, sessions, and browsers if you provide the same identifying information. If you provide a third party’s website with the same identifying information and that third party utilizes the same method of hashing it is possible that the third party could match information obtained from us and combine it with information that you provide to the third party website. You can also learn more about one of our partners, ALC, that may receive hashed emails and how to opt-out of their targeted services by visiting: <https://optoutpreference.org/>.
