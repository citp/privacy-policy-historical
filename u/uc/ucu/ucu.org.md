# Privacy Policy - University Credit Union, Los Angeles, CA

University Credit Union (UCU) places a high priority on keeping member information confidential and secure. We recognize that you expect privacy and security for your personal and financial affairs. We understand the need to safeguard sensitive information about you that you have entrusted to us. The following is UCU's Privacy Policy for Member Account Information and for Internet usage. 

Member Accounts Guidelines

**Maintenance of Accurate Information**  
UCU has internal procedures that ensure a member's financial information is accurate, current and complete in accordance with reasonable commercial standards. UCU will respond to requests in a timely manner in order to correct inaccurate information.

**Collection, Retention and Use of Information**  
UCU collects, retains and uses information about you only where we reasonably believe that it will help administer our business or provide products, services and other opportunities to you. 

**Employee Access to Information**  
UCU employees are informed about the importance of confidentiality and member information privacy. UCU has policies in place that outline the importance of privacy protection and reviews the guidelines for using the information. We take appropriate disciplinary measures to enforce employee privacy responsibility.

**Security Procedures to Protect Information**  
UCU maintains security standards and procedures to help prevent unauthorized access to confidential information about you. We periodically update and test our technology to improve the protection of our information about you and to assure the integrity of our information.

**Restrictions on the Disclosure of Account Information**  
UCU does not reveal specific information about member accounts or other personally identifiable data to unaffiliated third parties for their independent use, except when: 1) the information is provided to help complete a member initiated transaction; 2) the member requests it; 3) the information is provided to a reputable credit bureau or similar information reporting agency; or, 4) the disclosure is required by or allowed by law (i.e., subpoena, investigation or fraudulent activity, etc.).

**Sharing Information With Our Affiliates**  
UCU has relationships with certain affiliates that work closely with us to provide accounts and services for you. We release only information allowable by law in order to provide services and products offered through the credit union. 

**Maintaining Account Privacy in Business Relationships with Third Parties**  
Sometimes it is necessary to provide personally identifiable information about you to a third party. This would be arranged with a company not affiliated with the credit union but contracted to perform certain services for the membership, such as a vendor hired to prepare statements, process credit card transactions or print check orders. These companies act on our behalf and are obligated to keep the information that we provide to them confidential.

**Opt-Out Information**  
All consumers have the option of identifying themselves to not receive solicitations of pre-approved credit by mail as requested through credit bureaus. Call this one toll-free number for opt-out to the three largest credit bureaus: Experian, Equifax and Trans Union: **1-888-5-OPT-OUT** (1-888-567-8688)

**Internet Guidelines**

**Protecting Online Applications**  
When you apply online for accounts or use the Home Branch online banking service, you provide personal information that is necessary for us to process your application. To ensure that your information remains confidential, all sessions are established with Secure Socket Layer (SSL). SSL encrypts and decodes all data transmitted only between your browser and the UCU server. For more information on security and recommended browsers, please see the [Home Branch Security](http://www.ucu.org/hb_security.htm) on our Web site.

It is recommended that when using a browser containing any personal data, that you end the browser session so other users or persons do not have access to your personal information.

**Information Collected and Stored Automatically**  
For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, UCU employs software programs to monitor Web site traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or modify information, or other wise cause damage.

UCU also uses software programs to collect statistical information about the use of UCU's Web site and applications contained therein. Programs are used to create summary statistics, which are used for such purposes as assessing what information is of most and least interest, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas. No personal information, such as your name or address is collected or used for this analysis. We collect no information that would identify you personally, unless you give your authorization for us to retain that information. Any data automatically stored is kept as the confidential records of the credit union and is not sold or distributed in part or whole to any third party. 

**Use of Cookies on the UCU Web Site**  
UCU only utilizes the use of cookies in its Home Branch application. For each logon session, a cookie is maintained only to verify that the user receiving the information is the user that logged on. Once you terminate your session on Home Branch, the cookie is no longer valid. 

UCU contracts with affiliated parties to provide other Web-based applications. These services, usually housed on the affiliates servers, may employ the use of cookies to administer their application. 

**Information Collected from E-mails and Web Forms**  
UCU uses personally identifiable information from an electronic mail message containing a question or comment or from a form that e-mails us information to fulfill a request for information or to respond to your requests. UCU reserves the right to store these requests to assist us in following-up or maintaining service quality of requests or to provide us with information for future improvements to our Web site. We may forward your electronic message or request to other employees who are better able to respond to your particular need. We do not create individual profiles with the information you provide. UCU may keep e-mail addresses or profiles on address or data that you personally authorize us to keep (for internal marketing or promotional purposes). UCU does not give, sell or transfer personal information to third parties, unless required by law.

**Links to Other Sites**  
To provide you with greater access of information, UCU maintains a list of links to other sites. This is provided as a service to our membership. UCU has no control over these sites and is not responsible for the contents or privacy practices of these sites.
