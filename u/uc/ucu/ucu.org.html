<p>University Credit Union (UCU) places a high priority on keeping member information confidential and secure. We recognize that you expect privacy and security for your personal and financial affairs. We understand the need to safeguard sensitive information about you that you have entrusted to us. The following is UCU's Privacy Policy for <a href="#member">Member Account Information</a> and for <a href="#internet">Internet usage</a>. </p>

<p>

					<a name="member"></a><img src="images/bluepixel.gif" height="1" width="300">

<b></b></p><p><b><font size="+1">Member Accounts Guidelines</font></b></p>

<p> The Credit Union and our affiliate, UCU Financial Center Inc., understand
the importance of protecting the privacy of our members. As such, we are
committed to maintaining the confidentiality of each member's financial
records consistent with state and federal laws. The following sets forth our
policies regarding our use and protection of your financial information.
During the course of business we collect nonpublic personal information
about you from the following sources:
</p>

 <ul><li>Information we receive from you on applications or   other forms;</li> 
 <li>Information we obtain when verifying the information   we receive from
you;</li> 
 <li>Information about your transactions with us, our   affiliates, or others;</li> 
 <li>Information we receive from a consumer reporting   agency.</li> 
</ul>

<p>Generally, we may share all information that we may collect from you as
described above, with third parties to complete transactions and maintain
accounts and related records (such as data processing transactions and
records). We may also share such information with select nonaffiliated third
parties if: 1) you request or authorize it; 2) the information is provided
to help complete a transaction initiated by you; 3) the information is
provided to a consumer reporting agency in accordance with the Fair Credit
Reporting Act; or 4) the disclosure otherwise is lawfully required or
permitted.</p>

<p>Also, we may enter into agreements with other businesses to provide support
or services to us or for one or more of our products, such as mailing houses
that assist us in delivering your statements and other promotional
materials. Under certain circumstances we may also enter into joint
marketing agreements with other financial service providers, such as
mortgage bankers, securities broker-dealers, and insurance companies and
agents. Before entering into relationships with such entities, we require
them to agree to safeguard our membersš information and to comply with all
applicable privacy laws.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we may also disclose nonpublic personal information about you
to other nonaffiliated and affiliated third parties not described above as
permitted by law.</p>

<p>In addition, the Credit Union is affiliated with a Credit Union Service
Organization, UCU Financial Center Inc. a wholly-owned subsidiary of UCU.
The Credit Union and UCU Financial Center Inc. work together and share
information about your accounts to provide the products and services you
want.</p>

<p>In addition to safeguarding you as an active member, if you decide to
terminate your membership or become an inactive member, we will adhere to
the privacy policies and practices as described in this notice.</p>

<p>Because of the limited way we share information with nonaffiliated and
affiliated third parties, we are not required to provide you with the
opportunity to opt-out from the disclosure of information to such third
parties.</p>

<p>We restrict access to your personal and account information to those
employees who need to know that information to provide products or services
to you. Our employees access information about you when needed to administer
your accounts, to provide requested services, or in response to a legally
valid outside request or order (such as a subpoena). In addition, our
employees may also access information to exercise our rights under the law
or pursuant to any agreement with you. We maintain physical, electronic, and
procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard your
nonpublic personal information.</p>

<p>We strive to ensure that our records contain accurate information about you.
If you see any inaccuracies in your statements, please call (310) 477-6628
or e-mail us at ucumail@ucu.org. We will promptly investigate and make any
necessary changes to update your records.</p>

<p>Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), it is the Credit Union's
practice to share Transaction/Experience Information (as defined by the
FCRA) with its affiliates and nonaffiliated third parties to the extent
permitted by law.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to revise our policy as our business needs change or as
the law requires. If we revise our policies, we will provide our active
members with copies of our new policies at that time.</p>


<!-- <p><b>Maintenance of Accurate Information</b><br>
UCU has internal procedures that ensure a member's financial information is accurate, current and complete in accordance with reasonable commercial standards. UCU will respond to requests in a timely manner in order to correct inaccurate information.</p> 

<p><b>Collection, Retention and Use of Information</b><br>
UCU collects, retains and uses information about you only where we reasonably believe that it will help administer our business or provide products, services and other opportunities to you. </p>

<p><b>Employee Access to Information</b><br>
UCU employees are informed about the importance of confidentiality and member information privacy. UCU has policies in place that outline the importance of privacy protection and reviews the guidelines for using the information. We take appropriate disciplinary measures to enforce employee privacy responsibility.</p>

<p><b>Security Procedures to Protect Information</b><br>
UCU maintains security standards and procedures to help prevent unauthorized access to confidential information about you. We periodically update and test our technology to improve the protection of our information about you and to assure the integrity of our information.</p>

<p><b>Restrictions on the Disclosure of Account Information</b><br>
UCU does not reveal specific information about member accounts or other personally identifiable data to unaffiliated third parties for their independent use, except when: 1) the information is provided to help complete a member initiated transaction; 2) the member requests it; 3) the information is provided to a reputable credit bureau or similar information reporting agency; or, 4) the disclosure is required by or allowed by law (i.e., subpoena, investigation or fraudulent activity, etc.).;5) providing information to effect-administrate-enforce obligations; 6) the information is to non-affiliated parties for joint marketing; or, 7) the information is to prevent against actual or threatened fraud.</p>

<p><b>Sharing Information With Our Affiliates</b><br>
UCU has relationships with certain affiliates that work closely with us to provide accounts and services for you. We release only information allowable by law in order to provide services and products offered through the credit union. </p>

<p><b>Maintaining Account Privacy in Business Relationships with Third Parties</b><br>
Sometimes it is necessary to provide personally identifiable information about you to non-affiliated third parties for joint marketing purposes. This would be arranged with a company not affiliated with the credit union but contracted to perform certain services for the membership, such as a vendor hired to prepare statements, process credit card transactions or print check orders. These companies act on our behalf and are obligated to keep the information that we provide to them confidential.</p>

<p><b>Opt-Out Loan Information</b><br>
All consumers have the option of identifying themselves to not receive solicitations of pre-approved credit by mail as requested through credit bureaus. Call this one toll-free number for opt-out to the three largest credit bureaus: Experian, Equifax and Trans Union:  <b>1-888-5-OPT-OUT</b> (1-888-567-8688)</p> -->

<p><b>Protecting Online Applications</b><br>
When you apply online for accounts or use the Home Branch online banking service, you provide personal information that is necessary for us to process your application. To ensure that your information remains confidential, all sessions are established with Secure Socket Layer (SSL). SSL encrypts and decodes all data transmitted only between your browser and the UCU server.

<p>It is recommended that when using a browser containing any personal data, that you end the browser session so other users or persons do not have access to your personal information.</p>

<p><b>Information Collected and Stored Automatically</b><br>
For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, UCU employs software programs to monitor Web site traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or modify information, or otherwise cause damage.</p>  

<p>UCU also uses software programs to collect statistical information about the use of UCU's Web site and applications contained therein. Programs are used to create summary statistics, which are used for such purposes as assessing what information is of most and least interest, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas. No personal information, such as your name or address is collected or used for this analysis. We collect no information that would identify you personally, unless you give your authorization for us to retain that information. Any data automatically stored is kept as the confidential records of the credit union and is not sold or distributed in part or whole to any third party. </p>

<p><b>Use of Cookies on the UCU Web Site</b><br>
UCU only utilizes the use of <a href="hb_faq.htm#4">cookies</a> in its Home Branch application. For each logon session, a cookie is maintained only to verify that the user receiving the information is the user that logged on. Once you terminate your session on Home Branch, the cookie is no longer valid. </p>

<p>UCU contracts with affiliated parties to provide other Web-based applications. These services, usually housed on the affiliate servers, may employ the use of cookies to administer their application. </p>

<p><b>Information Collected from E-mails and Web Forms</b><br>
UCU uses personally identifiable information from an electronic mail message containing a question or comment or from a form that e-mails us information to fulfill a request for information or to respond to your requests. UCU reserves the right to store these requests to assist us in following up or maintaining service quality of requests or to provide us with information for future improvements to our Web site. We may forward your electronic message or request to other employees who are better able to respond to your particular need. We do not create individual profiles with the information you provide. UCU may keep e-mail addresses or data that you personally authorize us to keep (for internal marketing or promotional purposes). UCU does not give, sell or transfer personal information to third parties, unless required by law.</p>
