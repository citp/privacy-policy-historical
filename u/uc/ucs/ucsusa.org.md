# UCS Privacy Statement | Union of Concerned Scientists

The Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) respects your right to privacy and is committed to maintaining your confidence and trust. We have created the following privacy policy to inform you about the ways in which we collect and use information across our website.

 UCS does not collect any information from you without your knowledge and permission, and we do not ask that you enter any personal information to access or use most areas of the UCS website. In order to use some of the tools and functions, however, such as the online action center, you must enter some identifying information. UCS does not disclose this information to anyone except 1) to identify you, as described in the following paragraphs, to those you contact through our website and 2) to manage our website and database with the help of service providers, who are subject to a non-disclosure agreement. Information you provide UCS is stored in a secure location and is accessible only by designated staff. We do not sell or rent any information you provide us through our website.

 **Website Usage  
** Most areas of our site are accessible without having to provide personal information of any kind. Some of our services do, however, require some form of identification, which the user is free to provide (or withhold) voluntarily. 

UCS also collects aggregate website browsing information including (but not limited to) IP address, domain name, page views, and Internet browser. This information is used to improve our website and will not be disclosed to third parties.

 **Cookies  
** Like most websites, UCS places a "cookie," or small text file, in the browser files of visitors to our site. This cookie is used to collect website traffic information and does not collect personally identifiable information about a user. Nevertheless, users retain the right to reject our cookie.

 **Collection of Personal Information  
** UCS may collect personal information when it is voluntarily submitted to [www.ucsusa.org](http://www.ucsusa.org/). Submission of such information that includes the user's phone number, email, or mailing address implies the user's consent to being contacted by UCS, but we do not share emails or phone numbers with third parties. 

**Secure Transactions  
** When you donate to UCS via our website your donation information is encrypted and transmitted via a secure connection. UCS uses your credit card information only for the purpose of processing your donation. We will not disclose this information except as necessary to process your donation and we do not store it once your donation has been processed. UCS stores all member information on secure servers.

If you become a financial contributor to UCS, your mailing address may be exchanged with other organizations. We do not sell or exchange email addresses or phone numbers. Exchanging members mailing addresses with other like-minded groups extends the reach of our work by helping us recruit new members. Members may opt out of such list exchanges at any time by sending an email including your full name and address to our membership department at [member@ucsusa.org](mailto:member@ucsusa.org). 

**Online Activism  
** To send a message from our online action center to government officials and other decision makers you must identify yourself by name, address, email address, and in some cases, phone number. UCS includes this information when we send your message to the target of the action. This is necessary for your message to be effective, and in many cases, is required for submission of your letter to target’s web forms.  
If you use the UCS action center to submit comments to a government agency your comments, name, mailing and email address may be posted on the agency's web site in accordance with agency public records policies.

  **Ecards and "Tell Your Friends" Pages**  
To forward an article or action alert, send an ecard, or invite friends to a house party you must enter your name, your email address, and the email address(es) of anyone you are sending information to. UCS includes your name and email address when we send your message, but the email addresses of the people you send the information to are not stored in the UCS database or added to our mailing list.

 **Other Places Information May Be Requested  
** In addition to information you enter when sending messages to friends and decision makers from UCS's website, you may submit information directly to UCS for purposes including donating, subscribing to emails, or entering a contest. UCS will not disclose this information except as described above.

 **Communications from UCS  
** If you have opted to receive email from UCS you may unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link that appears in bottom of all email communications sent by UCS or by sending an email to [member@ucsusa.org](mailto:member@ucsusa.org).   
If you have provided UCS with your mailing address or phone number, we may contact you by phone or mail. You can choose not to receive such communications by contacting our membership department at [member@ucsusa.org](mailto:member@ucsusa.org) or UCS, Two Brattle Square, Cambridge, MA  02138.

 **Privacy Policy Changes  
** UCS continually examines the best options for maintaining a high level of privacy on our site. From time to time, therefore, this privacy policy may be changed. Your use of the UCS website after the date specified below constitutes your agreement to our terms.
