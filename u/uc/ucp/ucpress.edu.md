# Privacy Policy - University of California Press

University of California Press, on behalf of the Regents of the University of California, is the sole owner and operator of this site.

Our Web server automatically recognizes only the domain name of each visitor to our Web site, not the e-mail address. This information is used to help improve the site's functionality. We make use of Cookies technology in our shopping cart, but that information is stored on the visitor's computer, not on our server. The shopping cart accesses that information to allow the visitor to collect items in a personal shopping cart, remove them, change them, and add to them indefinitely without making a purchase. The shopping cart keeps track of the visitor's selections and calculates charges. The information stored in Cookies is never collected, reviewed, or in any way made use of except in the automated processing of the customer's submitted order. If a customer places an order, that name and street address are stored in our order processing system (e-mail addresses are not stored) and the customer may receive follow-up mailings from us with information on new titles or upcoming events. If a customer does not wish to receive such mailings or does not wish to have his or her name made available to other similar organizations, it is requested that we receive notification in writing at the address below.

From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will post the policy changes to our Web site to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back at our Web site periodically.
