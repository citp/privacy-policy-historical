          <p>UCanApply.com's Apply Online Program allows you to apply to schools, colleges, educational boards, exam conducting bodies and Universities you select. Each school requires you to provide the information requested on its application. In order for your application to be processed, all information requested by a school must be provided. In connection with processing your application, we may collect payment or billing information (e.g., credit card information) from you to pay the school's application fees.

The said services provider is of the highest repute and verified by reliable security agencies like verisign etc. We use a service to convert your details uploaded within your online application to a PDF format. We also may use a third party address verification service and communication services for sending of SMS, Emails etc.<br><br>
