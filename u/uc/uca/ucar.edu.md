# NCAR|UCAR|UOP Privacy Policy

[Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20061219121549id_/http%3A//www.ucar.edu/legal/terms_of_use.shtml) | [Copyright/Disclaimer](https://web.archive.org/web/20061219121549id_/http%3A//www.ucar.edu/legal/terms_of_use.shtml#copyright)

**UCAR PRIVACY POLICY**

This privacy policy covers UCAR’s treatment of personal information. Please review the UCAR Privacy Policy so that you can understand your options in using the UCAR web site. Use of this web site signifies your agreement to the Privacy Policy. 

**What Personal Information Does UCAR Collect?** You can visit the UCAR Web site without identifying who you are, or revealing personally identifiable information. If you do provide personal information when signing up for a service, UCAR will not sell, trade, or give away your information. 

**General Use Information**. UCAR receives and stores certain types of information whenever you interact with the web site. For example, UCAR maintains web activity log files such as the number of pages requested, time spent on a page, and result sets from search queries. UCAR extracts and aggregates information from these log files to gauge and improve the effectiveness of the web site and services. UCAR does not link this general use information to other personably identifiable information.

From time to time, UCAR may share information with outside contractors, auditors, consultants, and others hired by UCAR to assist in carrying out financial or operational activities. UCAR informs these parties about safeguarding personal information, and requires them to use it only for an authorized purpose consistent with this privacy policy.

**Cookies.** Parts of the UCAR web site may use cookies to improve the your interaction with the site or service. UCAR does not use cookies for tracking purposes except when used in conjunction with a service that requires keeping track of a session, or actions, (e.g. a service allowing a user to see their previous search queries) and you have agreed to this when signing up to that service. 

**Signing Up For Services.** In some instances, UCAR may request information through an enrollment process for a web service, web site analysis, survey, or event registration. To enroll, you may voluntarily supply personal information. UCAR shall use the information, and may share the information with event planners, only as described in the enrollment process. Contact the web site operator to correct any information you submit.

From time to time UCAR will conduct surveys of visitors to the site to obtain demographic information. Such information will be compiled and shared only within UCAR. 

**Security.** UCAR maintains all personal data with technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to protect against loss, unauthorized access, destruction, misuse, modification, and improper use. No computer system or information can be completely protected against every possible hazard, but UCAR provides reasonable and appropriate controls to protect personal information against foreseeable hazards.

**Public Forums.** UCAR maintains a number of public email lists and forums for use by interested individuals. Some are open for subscription and use; others are moderated where a list or forum moderator may limit subscription and posting access. In each case, users can subscribe and unsubscribe from these areas at any time. Contact the web site operator to correct any information you submit. 

Please note that any information that you post to a public bulletin board or chat room is available to all persons accessing that site. Unsubscribing from a list or forum will not remove any name, email address or information that was part of any previous posting from any archive of these lists or forums. 

**Legal Requirements.** UCAR may disclose information in response to legal process, such as a court order or subpoena. 

**Children’s Guidelines.** Students are advised to consult with their parents before giving any personal information online. UCAR may provide services either directed at children grades K through 12, or where children are expected to be among the users. Two common examples are a virtual library reference desk and an "Ask-A" service to allow students to either send a question to a librarian or to a scientist in an "Ask-A-Scientist" service. 

In sending a question, students may be asked to provide their first name, grade, school, and state/country; the information requested by these services is used solely for participation in these activities and is neither stored nor sold to third parties. If the question and corresponding answer is posted on the web site or included in reports (e.g. an FAQ), only the student’s first name, grade, and state/country will appear.

**Third Party Sites.** UCAR is not responsible for the privacy practices of non-UCAR web sites to which the UCAR web site may link. 

If you have any questions about this privacy statement or the practices of UCAR, including how to correct information you submit, please contact the Office of General Counsel or call 303-497-8874 or write UCAR at the address below.

Please include your name, address and email address when you contact us.
