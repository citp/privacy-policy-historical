UCAN operates the Website. The Website allows viewers to subscribe to become members, subscribe to daily newsletters and to submit comments on certain news articles. Where a viewer subscribes to, or submits a comment, the viewer must provide a name and email address for the purpose of identifying the viewer, which assists the Website’s editorial and moderation process. Automatic collection: Cookies: We may use a feature of your browser called a cookie to assign your computer a ‘User ID’. Cookies contain information by which UCAN can identify your computer to our servers. You may configure your browser so that you are notified before a cookie is downloaded or so that your browser does not accept cookies.

UCAN may use information contained in cookies to make assumptions about the user of the computer and to provide users of that computer with focused advertising that UCAN believes may be of interest, based on that information.

The personal information we collect from the Website and store may include (but is not limited to), name, address, contact details, gender, occupation, company and if relevant, financial information, including credit card information, banking details and income information.
