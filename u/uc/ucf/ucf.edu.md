Our Web server compiles statistics regarding the volume and timing of access to our Web site, such as the time and pages accessed. We do this so that we can improve the content and structure of our Web site, and only aggregate information is collected.

If members of the general public choose to share personal information with us by sending us a message, or filling out an electronic form, we will use the information only for the purposes authorized. Some of the information may be saved for a designated period of time to comply with the state of Florida’s archiving policies, but we will not disclose information about public visitors to this site with third parties or other government agencies, unless required to do so by Florida or federal law. And if we are required to disclose information by law, we will make every effort to notify any affected parties in advance.
