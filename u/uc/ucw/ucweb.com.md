This Privacy Policy is to describe what information we collect and how we use it. We recommend that you read this Privacy Policy carefully to make an informed decision about whether you want to use or continue using UC Services [including UC Sites, UC Applications (“apps”), and/or other UC Services].

  1. • We collect certain information to offer you the UC Services;
  2. • We take security measures to safeguard this information;
  3. • We use this information to enhance your use of the UC Services, to improve these Services, to make them easier, better and more relevant;
  4. • We will not share your personally identifiable information with third parties without your explicit consent;
  5. • We may use non-personally identifiable information to serve relevant advertisements.



Whether you are new to UC or a long-time user, please do take the time to get to know our practices – and if you have any questions contact us. 

  


## 1\. The information collected by UC

When you use UC Service, UC may collect certain information such as your username and IP address. Depending on the type of UC Service, this information may be disclosed, stored and used to provide you with a better experience.

  


## Information that you manually provide

We collect and you intentionally provide personal information when you post it to the UC Service or send it to us, including, but not limited to when you create an account on the UC Service. It is your choice whether to send personal information to us. 

Some information must be provided in order to participate in certain services, features, programs, or activities, so the decision not to provide information may limit or eliminate certain functions of the UC Service or your ability to participate. The types of personal information that we tend to request about you include, but not limited to: your username, email address. 

  


## Information automatically collected

We may automatically collect certain information from users through tracking mechanisms such as “cookies” and other tools that collect information from your device or browser. Cookies are computer files that are saved to your computer or device and which may store information about you, your computer or device, and browser. For example, we use cookies to store your username and password so that the UC Service can recognize you and allow you to access your account without requiring you to reenter the information. Information the UC Service automatically collects includes, but is not limited to: your user name and password; the IP address, model, manufacturer, operating system and version, and location of your device or computer; as well as information about your use of the UC Service (e.g., date and time of access, length of access, flow regularities, etc.). We may use this information for any lawful purpose, including, for example, using your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to operate the UC Service, to help identify you, and to gather usage information. You may choose to decline cookies or other tracking mechanisms if your browser or system permits, but doing so may affect your ability to access or use certain features of the UC Service. 

  


## Information from other sources

We may obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from business partners, contractors, and other third parties and add it to our account information or other information we have collected.

  


## Specific information collection

Please see the privacy policy of specific product practices.

  


## Accuracy of information you provide

When you supply personal information to us, you agree to supply accurate information only, and agree that we may assume its accuracy and rely on it. If we provide means for you to update your information, you agree to update the information to keep it accurate. 

  


## 2\. Use of the information collected

  1. UC will use the collected information for the following purposes:
  2. • to enable you to use the Service and to enhance your experience;
  3. • to send information to you about other UC Services, or promotional actions of UC;
  4. • to serve you relevant advertising;
  5. • to provide your information to third parties pursuant to legal obligations.

  


## Use by UC

As a general matter, we use the information we collect, to provide the Service to you. We will also try to enhance and personalize your use of the UC Services based on this information. UC may offer you targeted advertisements based on for example your age, gender and type of device.

In addition, UC wants to keep you informed of developments of the UC service and of any promotional actions by UC. We may ask you to participate in surveys in order to help us enhance the Service.

UC uses the information it collects for statistical purposes and for reporting. This allows us for example to monitor performance and detect technical problems. All analysis is done in an anonymous, aggregate manner, such that no part of the data can be traced back to individual users.

UC may combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other UC services – for example to make it easier to share things with people you know. We will not combine Double Click cookie information with personally identifiable information unless we have your opt-in consent. 

UC processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. We may process your personal information on a server located outside the country where you live. 

  


## Use by third parties

We do not share your personal information with others except as indicated below. We may share personal information with:

**Normal site operation**

When you use UC Service, UC will have access to information in the profile associated with your username as well as information you post to UC including, but not limited to, threads and comments you post in forums. 

**Service providers**

We may share your personal information, which may include your name and contact information (including email address) with third parties that perform certain services on our behalf. These services may include providing support, performing data analysis, and providing and supporting Site functionality and features. To the extent we provide access to your personal information to a service provider, they are not permitted to share or use the information for any purpose other than providing services to us. 

**Other situations**

We also may disclose your personal information:

In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us. We reserve the right, but do not undertake a duty, to notify you of court orders, subpoenas or other legal process if allowed. If you do not want us to respond to legal process compelling us to disclose your information, you need to obtain a valid order permitting us to refuse to disclose it and serve the order on us at least 3 business days before the response deadline.

When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce the Site terms and conditions or other agreements or policies.

In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, reorganization, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy, including to prospective or actual purchasers in connection with any of these transactions.

We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners – like publishers, advertisers or connected sites. For example, we may share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. 

  


## 3\. Protection of information

UC will take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect the information we collect against loss, misuse or any form of unlawful processing. Information on UC servers is stored in a secured manner and access is limited to authorized employees only. However, it is important to note that we cannot eliminate all security risks associated with data transmission and storage.

  


## 4\. Viewing, changing or removing your personal information

You can view the personal information from the account you created and change them as you like. When changing or updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity first. Please note that we may be required by law to store the information we collect, even after you have terminated your use of the UC Services.

For technical reasons, it may be impossible for us to determine whether you have stopped using the UC Services. For the mobile applications, it may also be impossible for UC to determine whether you have deleted the application. In such cases, we reserve the right to remove your account and the information you have provided us if you have not used the Service for an extended period of time.

  


## 5\. Application

Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by UCWeb Inc. and its affiliates, including services offered on other sites (such as our advertising services), but excludes services that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy. 

Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other companies or individuals, including products or sites that may be displayed to you through the browser, or other sites linked from our services. Our Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of other companies and organizations who advertise our services, and who may use cookies, pixel tags and other technologies to serve and offer relevant ads.
