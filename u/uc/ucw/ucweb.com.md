## 1\. The information collected by UCWeb

You do not need to provide any Personal Information in order to download and use UCWeb Services. When you download the Application or use the Application, Website or the Services, we receive only standard Non-Personal Information that web browsers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. The purpose of collecting Non-Personal Information is to better understand how UCWeb visitors use UCWeb Services. From time to time, UCWeb may release Non-Personally Information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on its Website usage trends.

  


## Manually provided information

You may provide your Personal Information to us, such as your username and email addresses, when you access certain Services offered via the application, for instance, when you create an account on UCWeb Services. It is your choice whether to send personal information to us.

When you participate in one of our surveys, we may collect additional profile information. You may also provide other types of Information to us voluntarily, such as your operating system and version, and other information requested if you contact us via e-mail requesting support from UCWeb Services. It is your choice whether to send personal information to us.

  


## Automatically collected information

We also use cookies to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and what your search and view. Cookies are computer files that are saved to your device and which may store information about you, your device, and your browser, but they do not include individual’s names, or other information that is personally identifiable. For example, cookies are used to identify user’s device and record the visit so that the UCWeb Services can allow you access to your account without requiring you to reenter the information.

You may choose to delete cookies or other tracking mechanisms on your browser anytime you want through Menu - Settings.

  


## Information from other sources

We may obtain information about you from business partners, contractors, and other third parties and add it to our account information or other information we have collected. We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via UCWeb Services in order to improve UCWeb Services.

  


## Information Accuracy

When you provide personal information to us, you agree to provide accurate information only, and agree that we may assume its accuracy and rely on it. If we provide means for you to update your information, you agree to update the information to keep it accurate.

  


## 2\. Information Protection

UCWeb is committed to protecting the security of your Personal Information. We use a variety of industry-standard security technologies and procedures to help protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. UCWeb has strict restrictions on access to user data. Only a limited number of UCWeb employees have access. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while UCWeb uses reasonable efforts to protect your Personal Information, UCWeb cannot guarantee its absolute security.
