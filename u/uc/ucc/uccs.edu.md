# Privacy Statement - University of Colorado Colorado Springs

The University of Colorado at Colorado Springs (UCCS) supports the protection of the privacy of individuals who visit official campus websites. It recognizes the numerous laws that govern the collection, storage, transfer, use and access to personally identifiable information. This statement extends to the collection of all personally identifiable information, regardless of source or medium. However, because UCCS is a state institution, some information collected from official websites may be subject to the Colorado Open Records Act (C.R.S. 24-72-201 et.seq.) In addition, UCCS may disclose information to third parties when such disclosure is required or permitted by law.

## Collection of Information

It is the practice of UCCS to collect the least amount of personally identifiable information required to fulfill its duties and responsibilities, to complete a particular transaction, or as required by law. A wide variety of colleges, schools, departments, divisions, and other units contribute to UCCS official web pages. Any website collecting personally identifiable information must include a privacy statement and collect only personally identifiable information required to fulfill the unit's duties and responsibilities.

Information you provide will only be shared with individuals within the university community who need to know it in order to respond to your request, to provide services and to carry out university business. For the same reasons, UCCS may also share your information with other people or organizations that provide services to UCCS or help us provide services to you. UCCS requires these individuals and organizations to protect your information according to this statement and applicable law.  
You may choose whether or not to provide personal information to UCCS via the Internet. If you choose not to provide personal information, you can still visit most UCCS websites, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services.

For website administration purposes, information, other than personally identifiable information, is collected for analysis. This information is used to help diagnose problems, assess what information is most of interest, determine technical design specifications, and identify system performance and/or problem areas, and other administrative functions. This information includes logs of user visits to UCCS websites, network traffic logs necessary to insure security and optimum performance, and small text files called "cookies" used to keep track of settings.

## Google Analytics

University Communications may also use Google Analytics to collect site usage data and to analyze overall usage of the site. Google Analytics uses cookies in your Web browsing software to track user sessions so that it can collect data about how users view and navigate the site. The data collected never includes names, usernames or e-mail addresses. Individual IP addresses are collected, but they are not associated with individual users other than as noted above. You may prevent Google Analytics from collecting data by turning off cookies in the preferences settings in your browser. For more information on Google Analytics, please visit [Google's website](http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/concepts/gaConceptsCookies.html).

Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this site. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve this site. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit this site, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google's ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this site by disabling cookies on your browser.

## Remarketing

We use tools such as Google Adwords and Google Display to remarket to individuals who visit our program pages. Third-party vendors, such as Google, show our ads on sites across the internet, and in some cases, use cookies to serve ads based on someone's past visits to our website. You can opt out of Google's use of cookies by visiting Google's [Ads Settings](https://support.google.com/adsense/troubleshooter/1631343?hl=en).
