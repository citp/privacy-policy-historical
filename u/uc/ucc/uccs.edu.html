<h1 id="uccs_sitetitle">Privacy Statement</h1>
    
    <h2>Commitment to Protection of Individual Privacy</h2>
 <p> The University of Colorado at Colorado Springs (UCCS) supports the  protection of the privacy of individuals who visit official campus  websites. It recognizes the numerous laws that govern the collection,  storage, transfer, use and access to personally identifiable  information. This statement extends to the collection of all personally  identifiable information, regardless of source or medium. However,  because UCCS is a state institution, some information collected from  official websites may be subject to the Colorado Open Records Act  (C.R.S. 24-72-201 et.seq.) In addition, UCCS may disclose information  to third parties when such disclosure is required or permitted by law.</p>
  <p>
  This statement does not apply to websites that are created and  maintained for purposes other than conducting official university  business by individual faculty, staff or students using resources made  available within a university domain.</p>
  <h2> Collection of Information </h2>
<p>      It is the practice  of UCCS to collect the least amount of personally identifiable  information required to fulfill its duties and responsibilities, to  complete a particular transaction, or as required by law. A wide  variety of colleges, schools, departments, divisions, and other units  contribute to UCCS official web pages. Any website collecting  personally identifiable information must include a privacy statement  and collect only personally identifiable information required to  fulfill the unit’s duties and responsibilities.</p>
    <p> Information you provide will only be shared with individuals within  the university community who need to know it in order to respond to  your request, to provide services and to carry out university business.  For the same reasons, UCCS may also share your information with other  people or organizations that provide services to UCCS or help us  provide services to you. UCCSrequires these individuals and organizations to protect your information according to this statement and applicable law. </p>
<p> You may choose whether or not to provide personal information to  UCCS via the Internet. If you choose not to provide personal  information, you can still visit most UCCS websites, but you may be  unable to access certain options, offers, and services.</p>
<p> For website administration purposes, information, other than  personally identifiable information, is collected for analysis. This  information is used to help diagnose problems, assess what information  is most of interest, determine technical design specifications, and  identify system performance and/or problem areas, and other  administrative functions. This information includes logs of user visits  to UCCS websites, network traffic logs necessary to insure security and  optimum performance, and small text files called “cookies” used to keep  track of settings.</p>
<h2> Comments and Feedback </h2>
<p> Send comments or  questions to webdept@uccs.edu. If you send comments, please include a  mailing address. Do not send attachments with the message. (Due to  concern about computer viruses and the damage they cause, email  messages containing attachments will be deleted without opening them.)</p>
<h2> <strong>Disclaimer</strong> </h2>
<p> The information provided in this  privacy statement should not be construed as giving business, legal or  other advice, or as guaranteeing the security of information provided  through UCCS websites.</p>
<p>The foregoing policy was approved by the Chancellor's Leadership Team on April 9, 2007.</p>
