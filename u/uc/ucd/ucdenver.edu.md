* We will say “yes” to all reasonable requests.  
**Ask us to limit what we use or share**  

* You can ask us not to use or share certain health information for treatment, payment, or our operations. We are not required to agree to your request, and we may say “no” if it would affect your care.  

* If you pay for a service or health care item out-of-pocket in full at time of service, you can ask us not to share that information for the purpose of payment or our operations with your health insurer. We will say “yes” unless a law requires us to share that information.
