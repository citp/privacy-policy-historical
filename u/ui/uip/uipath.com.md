# Privacy Policy

UiPath strongly believes that the protection of individuals' privacy is a critical issue when doing business via the Internet. We have created this policy to inform our site visitors and customers of the measures we employ to keep private and confidential the information they may choose to share with us.

UiPath does collect some kinds of information from visitors to this Website. By using this site, you agree to allow us to collect the kinds of information described later on this page, and to use it in the ways described.

Should we ever need to change this policy, we will post the changes on this page and send an email notification to customers and others who may have shared their email addresses with us. 

## Handling of Personally Identifiable Information

On UiPath Websites, we store personal information about you ONLY after you have given us permission to do so. You may choose to provide information to us if, for example, you register for a trial license, purchase a product, or subscribe to a newsletter.

By checking the checkbox confirming your approval with the terms of this privacy policy (where applicable), you grant to UiPath express consent to gather and process your personal information (name, surname and email address in particular) that you filled out in registration made via UiPath Websites.

UiPath may use the information collected via this Website with your approval only in order to (i) process your inquiries and orders and/or (ii) to help improve our products and/or (iii) to provide you with information concerning UiPath products, product licences, services, events and news and/or (iv) to fill out and process online surveys in accordance with these terms and/or (v) for other marketing, promotional and business purposes. UiPath is entitled to use this personal information for the purposes specified above anywhere in our international organization, i.e. it can be rendered to UiPath' controlling person or UiPath' affiliates (for example, information collected by our European headquarters may be shared with one of our offices in the United States and vice versa).

Employees of UiPath or approved contractors or resellers (collectively referred to as "UiPath") have access to personally identifiable customer information. All employees, contractors, and resellers are legally bound to uphold this policy and observe your right to privacy and confidentiality. We will never share your information with third parties outside UiPath unless you give express permission for us to do so, or unless we are required to do so under applicable law.

## Privacy Across the Company

As an international company, UiPath maintains databases in several countries. Any information that you submit to us via this Website may be sent electronically to a database maintained in a different country. We protect your privacy around the world by ensuring that this Website and all UiPath networks adhere to data protection principles described on this page.

## Online Information Collection

#### IP Addresses

UiPath uses IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our Websites, and to gather usage information. When you visit our site, we recognize only your domain name and not your email address. The only way we will ever obtain your email address is if you give it to us by filling out an online form or by sending us an email message.

#### Cookies

We use "cookies" on some (but not all) pages to deliver personalized content or to tailor our information offerings or responses according to the way you use the site, and/or your current context on the site. We do not use cookies to gather or transmit any personally identifiable information about you.

#### Data Protection

UiPath takes precautions to ensure the safety and confidentiality of the information we collect via our Website. We employ the latest data security technologies including firewalls, encryption, password protection, intrusion monitoring, and other techniques to keep your information as safe as modern networking technology can make it.

#### Use of Email Addresses

If you choose to give us your email address, we will communicate with you via email. We will not share your email address with others outside UiPath and its approved contractors and resellers. You can choose not to receive any more email at any time.

Depending on which email program you use and how it is configured, information about you may be sent automatically when you send us email. UiPath has no control over this and recommends that you consult your system administrator if you have concerns about what information is being sent by your email program.

#### Online Surveys

We may occasionally conduct online surveys that may ask you for demographic information (your location, position, tool use, etc.). If the online survey collects contact data such as your email address (although generally they do not), we will use those data to send you further information only if the form specifically asks for your permission and you give it. You are free to revoke any such permission at any time.

#### Links to Other Sites

The UiPath Website contains links to other sites. UiPath is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these linked Websites.

## Choice/Opt-Out

You can revoke your approval concerning the use of your personal information for marketing, promotional and business purposes specified in these terms and opt out of receiving email communications from UiPath at any time. You only need to email us to have your name and details removed from our e-mail list or registration database. Please allow 7 business days for the removal to be processed.

## Inquiries and Feedback

If you have any questions about this privacy statement, or if you wish to inspect or update the information we hold about you, please feel free to contact us at: [sales@uipath.com](mailto:sales@deskover.com)
