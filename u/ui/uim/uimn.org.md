The Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development (DEED) websites provide an electronic means for accessing information about the programs and services available through DEED. Web pages are continually under development as we attempt to keep our content as current as possible. 

DEED is committed to protecting the privacy of users in accordance with [Minn. Stat. § ](http://www.revisor.leg.state.mn.us/stats/13/)[13](http://www.revisor.leg.state.mn.us/stats/13/), the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act; this privacy statement explains how. We reserve the right to alter our privacy policy as business needs require. Any changes to this policy will be posted on this website in a timely manner.

If you choose to identify yourself by sending us an e-mail or completing our on-line forms, we use the personally identifying information to process or respond to your request:

> If you complete an on-line form, the information you provide is up to you. However, if you do not provide certain information, such as your name, it may be impossible for us to respond to your request.

We may retain this information in our files, either in electronic form or hardcopy. Some of this information is public data under the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act.

We recommend that you not use e-mail to send us private or sensitive data about yourself or others unless the data is encoded or encrypted. Also, users are cautioned that the collection of personal information requested from or volunteered by children on-line or by e-mail will be treated the same as information given by an adult and may be subject to public access.
