						<p>At Uizj.com, we are committed to protecting online user privacy. This “Privacy                                         Policy” discloses the privacy practices governing our knowing collection, use, and                                         disclosure of information. In order to ensure your privacy, information we collect                                         is used only in the manner and for the purposes described below.</p>
<p>Anonymous User Information: Uizj.com collects some anonymous information each time                                         you visit Uizj.com so we  can improve the overall quality of your online experience.                                         We collect your IP address,  referral data, and browser and platform type. You do                                         not have to register with Uizj.com before we can collect this anonymous information.                                         We do not collect any unique  information about you (such as your name, e-mail address,                                         etc.) except when you  specifically and knowingly provide such information. Uizj.com                                         does not require you to share  information that identifies you personally, such as                                         your name or email address, in  order for you to use the Uizj.com search. Uizj.com                                         assigns an anonymous ID number  to your requests and links the following additional                                         data to that number: the date  and time you visited Uizj.com, your search terms,                                         and the links upon which you  choose to click. Like most standard Web site servers,                                         we use log files to collect and  store this anonymous user information. We analyze                                         this information to examine  trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in                                         the aggregate, and gather broad  demographic information for aggregate use. Uizj.com                                         may present links in a format  that enables us to understand whether they have been                                         followed. We use this  information to understand and improve the quality of the Uizj.com                                         search.</p>
<p>Cookies: We use a feature of  Internet web browsers called a “cookie,” which is a                                         small file that is sent to your  computer when you visit a website. This enables                                         us to store user preferences and  track user trends and search patterns. We use cookies                                         to improve the quality of the Uizj.com services and to better understand how users                                         interact with us. We do not and  cannot use Cookies to retrieve individual personally                                         identifiable information about  you from your computer unless you knowingly and willingly                                         provided such information. The  cookie technology we use cannot obtain information                                         from your hard drive or pass on a  computer virus. You can reset your browser to                                         refuse all cookies or to  indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some Uizj.com                                         features or services may not  function properly without cookies.</p>
<p>Information security: We take  appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized                                         access to or unauthorized  alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. We restrict                                         access to your personally  identifying information to employees who need to know                                         that information in order to  operate, develop or improve our services.</p>
<p>Aggregated General Information: We may share aggregated general information about                                         our site with our corporate partners or others. Examples of this include the number                                         of users who searched for “Classic Cars”, the daily number of unique visitors, or                                         how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. Aggregated data does not contain                                         any personally identifiable information that could be used to contact or identify                                         you. Information sharing We may share personally identifying information to other                                         companies or individuals in any of the following limited circumstances:</p>
<p>We have your consent. We provide  such information to trusted businesses or persons                                         for the sole purpose of  processing personally identifying information on our behalf.                                         When this is done, it is subject  to agreements that oblige those parties to process                                         such information only on our  instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy                                         and appropriate confidentiality  and security measures. When required by law wherein                                         we have a good-faith belief that  such action is necessary to comply with a current                                         judicial proceeding, a criminal  investigation, a court order, or legal process served                                         on our Web site. We may also  share your personal information if we believe it is                                         necessary in order to  investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities,                                         suspected fraud, situations  involving potential threats to the physical safety of                                         any person, violations of Uizj.com’s terms of use, or as otherwise required by                                         law. If you have an account, we  may share the information submitted under your account                                         among all of our services in  order to provide you with a seamless experience and                                         to improve the quality of our  services. We will not disclose your account information                                         to other people or  non-affiliated companies, except in the limited circumstances                                         described in this Policy or with  your consent.

These companies  may use technologies to measure the effectiveness                                         of ads and emails and use  information about your visits to Uizj.com so that we                                         can provide a better search  experience to you.
