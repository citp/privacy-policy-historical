<h2>UrbanSitter</h2>
<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Effective March 29, 2011</p>
<p>
	UrbanSitter, LLC ("<b>UrbanSitter</b>", "<b>we</b>" or "<b>us</b>") is committed to respecting the privacy of your information.  This Privacy Policy ("<b>Privacy Policy</b>") describes the personal information we collect through our website and mobile applications (the "<b>Site</b>"), and how we collect and use this information.  </p>
<p></p><p>This Privacy Policy is organized into the following nine sections:</p>
<ol>
<li>Collection and Use of Personal Information</li>
<li>Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information</li>
<li>Disclosure of Your Information to Third Parties</li>
<li>Updating and Correcting Information</li>
<li>Your Choices</li>
<li>Security of Information</li>
<li>Age Restrictions</li>
<li>Changes to Privacy Policy</li>
<li>Questions About This Privacy Policy</li>
</ol>
<h3>1.	Collection and Use of Personal Information.</h3>
<p>Depending on how you use the Site, we may ask you to share personally identifiable information ("<b>Personal Information</b>") with us.  Whether you choose to share your Personal Information is completely up to you, but keep in mind that you may not be able to access some areas of the Site or effectively use some of the services we offer on the Site without sharing Personal Information.  Personal Information includes any information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact or locate you.  Examples include your name, address, email address, phone number, age, household information, educational background and credit card information.  Below are some examples of when we collect Personal Information.</p>
<ol class="letter-order-list">
<li>
		<span class="title">Account Information.</span>  When you register for the Site, we will ask for certain information about you, such as your name, address, email, birth date and phone number.  If you are registering as a Parent, we will also ask for the number of children you have; if you are registering as a Sitter, we will also ask for your total years of babysitting experience.  You can also import your account information from a third party, such as Facebook, to make the Site registration process easier.
<p>
			We may use your email address to send you account confirmations, notifications and appointment status reminders, to request reviews, contact you on behalf of other Users sending you messages, and to otherwise provide services to you in connection with the Site.  We may also send you promotional emails, such as monthly newsletters, new service offerings, special discounts and third-party offers.  If you would rather not receive promotional emails, please see the section below titled "Your Choices."
		</p>
<p>
			We also use your Personal Information for administrative purposes, such as addressing account and billing issues, troubleshooting Site issues, investigating abuse on the Site, responding to User inquiries and enforcing and applying our Terms of Service.  We may also contact you by text message solely in connection with the Services and only if you request that we do so.
		</p>
<p>
			If you choose to join Groups, we may use your address to include you in the appropriate Groups.
		</p>
<p>
			Other Users may also be able to find your Profile on the Site by using search parameters that coincide with the Personal Information you have provided to us.
		</p>
</li>
<li>
		<span class="title">User Profile.</span> After you register for the Site, you will have the opportunity to create a Profile about yourself.  Your Profile may include different information depending on whether you are a Parent or a Sitter.  Also, if you choose, you  may upload a photograph of yourself to include in your Profile.  How much information you disclose on your Profile is entirely up to you, though at a minimum, your Profile will include information you provided to us in the account registration process (though your contact information, as well as certain other information, is disclosed only in the limited manner described below).        
<ol class="roman-list-profile">
<li>
				<span class="title">For Parents:</span>  Parents may include information on their Profile about their children (age, number, allergies), emergency contact information, parking availability, school associations, and any specific requirements they have for Sitters (e.g., must have a car).  All registered Users will be able to view the Parent's photo (if provided), first name, last initial, neighborhood and (if elected) number of children; the other information in a Parent's Profile is disclosed to Sitters when they receive a booking request from Parent.
			</li>
<li>
				<span class="title">For Sitters:</span>  Sitters may include information about their hourly rates, background, availability, education, certifications, languages spoken and experience, and any geographic limitations or preferences.  All visitors to the Site (including non-registered visitors) can view a Sitter's Profile, except that a Sitter's full last name, email, address and phone number is disclosed only to a Parent with a confirmed booking.
			</li>
<p>			Information in your Profile is also available in search results to help your friends find you.
		  </p></ol>
</li>
<li>
		<span class="title">Reviews and Other Public Content.</span>  Parents will have the opportunity to provide Reviews about Sitters they have used.  Users may also have other opportunities to contribute to the Site, such as public forums, bulletin boards and talk threads.  We may store these contributions ("<b>Public Content</b>"), display them to other Users, and use them for promotional purposes.  Your Public Content becomes public information once you post it, and copies of it may continue to be viewable even after you delete your account.  Your Public Content may appear on other websites or web searches, and therefore this information can be read, collected and used by others.  Note that if you include Personal Information about yourself in your Public Content, it can be used and viewed by others.  Please remember that you are not permitted to disclose any Personal Information about another User or anyone else in your Public Content (see our content guidelines here <a href="/content/terms-use">Terms of service</a>.
	</li>
<li>
		<span class="title">Third Party References.</span>Sitters may request third parties to provide Reviews on the Site by providing the third party reference's email.  We will use the email only to contact the third party reference and to invite the third party reference to review the Sitter.  Third party references will be required to become a registered Parent in order to post a review.  As with other Reviews, the review and the Parent's user name will  be posted on the Sitter's Profile and search results pages that include the Sitter.
	</li>
<li>
		<span class="title">Inviting Friends/Sitters.</span>Users may invite friends to join the Site by providing their contact information or by entering your log-in information to import your address book from other sites.  We will use your friends' contact information to invite them to join and connect with you on the Site.  We may store their Personal Information in our records, but will not send them promotional emails unless they register for an account or otherwise request us to do so.
	</li>
<p>		<span class="title">Bookings and Other Site Activity.</span>Your completed bookings and other Site activity (e.g., Reviews) may be shared with other Users.  For example, your booking activity may be displayed on your friends' dashboards so your friends can see what Sitters you have used and/or reviewed, or Parents you have worked with.  In addition, other Users you have designated as "Favorites" may be visible to other Users.
	
</p><li>
		<span class="title">Messaging.</span>The Site allows you to exchange messages with other Users using the messaging feature.  We may store these messages in order to deliver them and allow you to manage them.
	</li>
<li>
		<span class="title">Facebook and Other Third Party Services.</span>The Site may allow access third party services, such as Facebook, to interact with friends and to import information about who you are connected with on those other services so you can connect with them on the Site.  Some of those third party services may also provide us with information from those accounts there to enhance and personalize your use of the Site.  For example, you can allow Facebook to tell us who your Facebook friends are so you can follow their activity on the Site (e.g., a friend's booking activity or reviews they have posted).  Your activity on the Site may also be shared on the third-party site.  For example, if you post a Review on the Site, your Review may be posted on your Facebook Wall.You can always opt-out of this feature in your Account Settings.  You can also further modify your privacy settings with those other services directly.
   </li>
<li>
	<span class="title">Payment Information.</span>To process payments, we will require your credit card information and billing information.  Users will also have the option of storing this information as part of their account information.  Credit card transactions are processed through industry standard Secure Socket Layer by a third party, which only uses your information for that purpose.
   </li>
<li>
	<span class="title">Feedback.</span>If you contact us to give us feedback, register a complaint or ask questions about the Site or Services, we may store your communications, including any Personal Information you include in them, so we can effectively respond to you.
   </li>
<p></p></ol>

<ol class="letter-order-list">
<li>
		<span class="title">Cookies.</span>  We collect some anonymous information about how you use the Site by setting and accessing cookies on your computer.  A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your computer.  These cookies track information such as how often you visit the Site, what pages you view, and where you go after you leave the Site.  The cookies track your computer, not you.  They are not connected to any personal information about you.  If you choose to disable a cookie, you may not be able to use certain features of the Site.

	</li>
<li>
		<span class="title">Web Beacons and Other Tracking Devices.</span>  We and/or advertising affiliates may use other industry standard technologies like web beacons or tracking pixels to count the number of users that visit a page on the Site that includes these web beacons.  Web beacons are used to report on site traffic and are used to analyze the effectiveness of advertising campaigns and how Users interact with the Site.  The web beacons do not identify individual users and analysis of data obtained is performed on an aggregate basis.  We may also rely upon third parties to assist with the use and implementation of web beacons.  We may also use third-party advertising companies to serve or track ads on the Site.  These companies may use non-personally identifiable information about your visits to the Site and other web sites in order to measure advertising effectiveness and to provide advertisements about goods or services that may be of interest to you.
	</li>
</ol>
<h3>3.	Disclosure of Your Information to Third Parties.</h3>
<ol class="letter-order-list">
<li>
		<span class="title">Disclosure By Law; Protection of Us and Others.</span>  We may disclose information you provide if required to do so by law, at the request of a third party, or if we, in our sole discretion, believe that disclosure is reasonable to (1) comply with the law, requests or orders from law enforcement, or any legal process (whether or not such disclosure is required by applicable law), (2) protect or defend UrbanSitter's, or a third party's rights or property, or (3) protect someone's health or safety, such as when harm or violence against any person (including you) is threatened.
	</li>
<li>
		<span class="title">Aggregate Data.</span>We may share aggregate data about Users with third parties, including advertisers and marketing partners.  This information does not identify individual Users.
	</li>
<li>
		<span class="title">Service Providers.</span>We may share your Personal Information with companies that perform services for us, such as analyzing customer data, providing marketing assistance, and processing credit card payments.  They have access to Personal Information as needed to perform their functions, but may not disclose your Personal Information for other purposes.
	</li>
<li>
		<span class="title">Business Changes.</span>We may share your information with any parent company, subsidiary, joint ventures or other companies under a common control that we may have now or in the future, in which case, we will require them to honor this Privacy Policy.  If another company acquires our company or all or substantially all of our assets, that company will own your information and will assume the rights and obligations with respect to that information as described in this Privacy Policy.
	</li>
<li>
		<span class="title">Third Party Advertisers</span>.Third parties may provide some of the advertisements on the Site.  We do not share any Personal Information with them, but they may have access to information they obtain through cookies, beacons or other tracking devices discussed in Section 2 above or that you share with them yourself.  Please note that we do not rent, share, sell or trade Personal Information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	We take security of your Personal Information seriously and take precautions to protect your Personal Information.  We encrypt certain sensitive information (such as credit card information) using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, and implement other commercially reasonable procedures to protect your Personal Information.  But, no method of data transmission over the Internet or data storage is 100% secure and therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information transmitted to or from the Site.

</p>
<h3>8.	Changes to Our Privacy Policy.</h3>

	We may revise our Privacy Policy from time to time.  The most current version of the Privacy Policy will govern our use of your information and will always be located on this webpage.  If we make a change to our Privacy Policy that is material, we will notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes before implementing the change on the Site and/or via the email associated with your account.
