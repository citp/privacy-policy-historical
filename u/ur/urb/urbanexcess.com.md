## Your Privacy

The Urban Excess team members are customers themselves of other Internet sites and fully appreciate and respect the importance of privacy on the Internet. We will not disclose information about our customers to third parties except where it is a necessary part of providing a service to you - e.g. Arranging for a product to be sent to you.

Therefore, we are totally committed to protecting the privacy of our site visitors and customers. By visiting Urban Excess, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice.

According to law, we must ask you to agree to that we handle your personal details. All details that you leave with us, or which we are given when you register for a purchase or visit our homepage, will be handled by Urban Excess. The information given will only be used by Urban Excess in order to fulfill our undertakings and informing you of offers that will appeal to you.

## What Personal Information is collected?

The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your shopping experience at Urban Excess. Here are the types of information we gather.

## Information You Give Us

We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, fulfilling orders, customizing future shopping for you, improving our store features, and communication with you.

## Automatic Information

We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our website. For example, like many web sites, we sometimes use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses our website.

For security purposes Urban Excess sometimes collects and analyzes the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet, and to our website. This is done for your protection for tracking purposes in the unfortunate event that someone gains access to your personal or financial information and opens an account, or makes purchases under your name.

## E-mail Communications

To help us make e-mails more productive to improve service and your shopping experience, we sometimes send you newsletters of our services and products, notifications of changes to our policies, and order confirmations. If you do not want to receive e-mail from us, other than order notifications and receipts, please adjust your "Subscription" preferences by logging into your account.

## What About Cookies?

A cookie is a small information file that is sent to your computer and is stored on your hard drive. If you have registered with us then your computer will store an identifying cookie which will save you time each time you re-visit Urban Excess, by remembering your email address for you and to provide features such as storage of items in your Shopping Cart between visits. You can change the settings on your browser to prevent cookies being stored on your computer without your explicit consent.

## Does Urban Excess Share the Information It Receives?

We respect your privacy and appreciate your business. At no time do we ever provide your account contact or payment information to any third party vendor, associate or service provider unless absolutely necessary in order to complete your transaction and order.

## How Secure Is Information About Me?

We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you provide to us for purchasing of our products or services.

We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer by clicking the "log off" link located in the side menu.
