#### What Information Do We Collect and How Do We Use It?

UrbanOutfitters.com collects customer information in an effort to improve our customer's shopping experience and to communicate with our customers about our products, services and promotions. We collect information such as your name, e-mail and postal address and credit card numbers, that you provide to us when you place an order, when you save your information with us or when you participate in a sweepstakes, promotion or survey. UrbanOutfitters.com may use your information collected online to process and fulfill your order. We also collect e-mail addresses at various locations within the site including when you order from the site so that we can send you any necessary e-mail messages related to your order - such as an order confirmation notice. In addition, we maintain a record of your product interests, purchases and whatever else might enable us to enhance and personalize your shopping experience. We also monitor site use and traffic patterns to improve our web site design and the products and services we offer. UrbanOutfitters.com recognizes that it must maintain and use customer information responsibly.

To serve you better, we may combine information you give us online, in our stores or through our catalogs. We may also combine that information with publicly available information and information we receive from or cross-reference with select partners and others. By combining this information we are better able to communicate with you about our products, special events and promotional purposes and to personalize your shopping experience.

Urban Outfitters will not rent or sell your e-mail address for any reason. Urban Outfitters does share information you provide to us when you participate in a sweepstakes with those companies with whom we have joined to offer these promotions as well as other companies whose promotions we think will interest you. We may disclose information about you to other members of the Urban Outfitters corporate family and as required by law. In addition, we may on occasion share a portion of our postal mailing list with other reputable organizations not owned or affiliated with Urban Outfitters who want to market products or services to you. If you do not want your name and address shared with other organizations or you no longer wish to receive Urban Outfitters catalogs, please contact us at 800-282-2200.
