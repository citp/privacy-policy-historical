# UrbanDaddy | Privacy Policy

UrbanDaddy, LLC ("UrbanDaddy") takes very seriously the private nature of your personal information. It is the goal of UrbanDaddy to bring you information that is relevant and targeted to your individual needs and, at the same time, protect your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how we treat the information we collect when you visit our Web site and/or register for our email publication. Please read this notice carefully. 

I. PERSONAL INFORMATION 

In order to distribute our email publication, we (obviously) need your e-mail address. So that we may provide you with additional services as well as more interesting and relevant content, we may request additional information, including your name, zip code and telephone number. UrbanDaddy does not collect any other personal information that you do not expressly provide. URBANDADDY WILL NOT DISCLOSE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO ANY THIRD PARTY WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT, EXCEPT TO A THIRD PARTY AS REQUIRED TO HELP US DISTRIBUTE OUR EMAIL PUBLICATION. 

II. NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION 

We may also request non-personally identifiable information, for example, annual income, buying preferences, and age. This information, also known as demographic and profile data, is optional. We may use this data to improve our site and/or personalize your experience at our site, in order to bring you more targeted and relevant content and to display such content according to your preferences. We may share this information with others, such as advertisers interested on advertising on the UrbanDaddy site but never on an individual level. This information will only be shared in an aggregate, anonymous form, which means that the information will not contain any personally identifiable information about you or any other person. However, we reserve the right to use aggregated, anonymous data about our users as a group for any business purpose, such as analyzing usage trends and seeking compatible advertisers and partners. 

III. USAGE INFORMATION 

In addition to collecting personal and non-personal information, UrbanDaddy may also collect non-personal, aggregated information about subscribers' use of our emails and our site. This information is not personally identifiable and will only be used to find out how subscribers use our service and site. For example, this information will tell us how much time users spend on our site, from which other sites subscribers came, and to what other sites subscribers go. The collection of this information allows us to, among other things, prepare for traffic load demands and to efficiently distribute our email publication. 

IV. REVIEW AND ACCESS 

You will have the ability to access the information that we have collected about you. You will have an opportunity to correct, update or modify this information. 

V. CHOICE/OPT-OUT 

If we ever send you information by e-mail concerning new products or services that you did not expressly request, we will provide you with an e-mail address by which you may request no future notices. 

VI. THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING 

Some of the ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to you by our web advertising partners. Information about your visit to their site, such as number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address or other personal information), is used to serve ads to you. 

VII. TRACKING & THIRD PARTY COOKIES 

You may have read about "cookies" or bits of information that are placed by a Website in a storage place on your own computer. As with most other Web sites, the UrbanDaddy does use cookies but only to allow us to quickly check your status as a subscriber and facilitate access to your preferences. Some of our advertisers may serve you cookies as well. Unfortunately, we do not have control over cookies placed by advertisers. If you don't want cookies, your Web browser likely includes an option that allows you to not accept them. 

VIII. IP ADDRESS 

Your Internet Protocol ("IP") address is usually associated with the place from which you enter the Internet, like your Internet Service Provider, your company or your university. We may, from time to time, use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, gather broad demographic information and administer our Website. 

IX. PG-13 

UrbanDaddy is not intended for use by children, especially those under age 13. No one under age 13 is allowed to use the site, provide any personal information or receive our email distributions. Minors between the ages of 13 and 17 must get the permission of their parent(s)or legal guardian(s) before viewing the website or receiving emails. 

IX. LINKS TO OTHER SITES 

As part of the service, UrbanDaddy may create links allowing you to access third party sites. UrbanDaddy is not responsible for the content that appears on those sites and does not endorse these sites. Please consult those sites' individual privacy policies in order to determine how they treat user information. 

X. SECURITY 

All information described above is stored on restricted database servers. 

XI. MODIFICATION TO THIS POLICY 

UrbanDaddy reserves the right to change this policy from time to time, however, all changes will be posted to this Privacy Policy at the time such changes are made. The date of the most recent revisions will appear on this page so please check back. Please note that continued access of UrbanDaddy will constitute your acceptance of any changes or revisions to the Privacy Policy.
