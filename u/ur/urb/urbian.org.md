If you choose to use our invitation service to tell another person about the Urbian Website, we will ask you for that person’s email address or other contact information necessary to send the invitation. Urbian will automatically send a one-time email or instant message inviting him or her to visit the Urbian Website. Urbian stores this information to send this one-time invitation, to register a contact addition if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of Urbian’s referral program. Your friend may contact us at office@urbian.org to request that we remove this information from our database.

**5.3 USER INFORMATION SHARED WITH THIRD PARTIES**  
Urbian may share your User Profile Information with third parties in order to collect information about the popularity of a product/service and to provide you with customized and personalized advertisements and promotions.

In the event that ownership of all or substantially all of Urbian, Inc., or businesses owned by Urbian, Inc., changes, your User Profile Information and personal information may be transferred to the new owner so the service can continue operations.

Urbian employees, agents and contractors may obtain access to your personal information if it is necessary in order to provide or maintain the Urbian Services. Outside contractors, agents or affiliates may temporarily store your information on their servers, but their use of the information will be restricted to the specific service for which they were contracted.

**6\. THIRD PARTY LINKS & ADVERTISEMENTS**  
The Urbian Website may contain links to other websites. Urbian is not responsible for the privacy practices of those web sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by Urbian.  
Advertisements that appear on the Urbian Website are sometimes delivered directly to you by third party advertisers. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. These third party advertisers may use other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. Doing this allows the advertising network to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. In this way, they may compile information about where individuals using your computer or browser saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked.

**7\. URBIAN MOBILE APPLICATION**  
In addition to the above, the Urbian Mobile Application also collects such information as: when users meet other users and where, messages sent to other users, messages left for other users, introductions, requests for new contacts, blog postings, information and pictures transferred or uploaded from the Urbian Mobile Application to the Urbian Website, events created on the Urbian Website and transferred to the Urbian Mobile Application. Such information is utilized both for operational reasons, to run and execute the Urbian Services, as well as for marketing purposes. 

**8\. UPDATING INFORMATION**  
Access and control over most personal information on the Urbian Website is readily available through the profile editing tools. Urbian users may modify or delete any of their profile information at any time by logging into their account. Information will be updated immediately. Individuals who wish to deregister their Urbian account may do so on the Settings page. Removed information may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time but will not be generally available to Urbian users.  
Where you make use of the communication features of the service to share information with other individuals on Urbian, such as sending a personal message to another Urbian user, you generally cannot remove such communications.

**9\. TERMS OF USE, NOTICES AND REVISIONS**  
Your use of the Urban Services, and any disputes arising from it, is subject to this Privacy Policy as well as our Terms of Use and all of its dispute resolution provisions including arbitration, limitation on damages and choice of law. We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use at any time.
