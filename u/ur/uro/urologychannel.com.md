**Links**

This site contains links to other sites. Healthcommunities.com, Inc., is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. 

No information is shared between Healthcommunities.com, Inc., and any of its retail partners. 

**Public Forums and Chat Registration**

This site makes forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information, and users should exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information. 

A user must only insert name and e-mail address (and he/she may use an inaccurate name or e-mail address) to post a question in the forums. This information is not used by Healthcommunities, unless the browser registers for a forum, in which case it is retained. Passwords are retained only when a user registers for a forum.

**Security**

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. Our forum information is posted. To protect your privacy, do not use your real name. Sending us your e-mail address for responses by our physicians is completely optional. You may check back in the forum for answers to your questions.

The management of Healthcommunities.com will periodically review the security policy to make sure it is clear to employees that Healthcommunities.com only collects information from users on the "Contact Us" feature. That information is limited to the name, address, and e-mail address of the user, and it does not require an actual name for e-mail. It requires only the insertion of characters within the space. In the event that a user signs up for a forum, we retain the information relative to the user and we remind them of the forum. 

The Web security is reviewed by the Board of Directors annually.

**Correct/Update**

This site gives users the option to change and modify information previously provided for all channels. Users may update their information through the "Contact Us" form on the sites.

  1. You can send e-mail to webmaster (at) healthcommunities.com. _(E-mail altered to prevent spam.)_
  2. Or use the Contact Us link in the top, black navigation bar. 

We use the "Contact Us" form to allow you to contact us directly with any questions or comments you may have. We read every message sent and try to reply promptly. This information is used to respond directly to your questions or comments. We may also file your comments to improve the site and program, or review and discard the information. Your personal information is not shared with third parties without your explicit permission. 




**Passive Information Collection**

Healthcommunities.com does not retain personal identification information. Healthcommunities.com does log such information as which pages the user visits, browser type, IP address, and access times. 

**Legal Disclaimer**

Healthcommunities.com does not share any personally identifiable information about users with third parties. We may disclose personal information when required by law or in good faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with a legal process served on our website.

**Notification of Changes**

We will notify you directly if there is a material change in our privacy practices. We will take commercially reasonable measures to obtain written or active e-mail consent from the user if Healthcommunities.com is going to be using the information collected from the user in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection. We will also post the changes in our Privacy Statement thirty days prior to a change.
