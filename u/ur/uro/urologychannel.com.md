2.       NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED AND HOW COLLECTED.
When you access or visit any of our Sites, we and our operational service providers (as defined

“cookies” and other technologies that may recognize, collect and/or transmit information that is
associated with you or your device. These various technologies may recognize, collect and/or
transmit information about your visits to our Sites, such as your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address,
the Internet or web domain that referred you, the type of operating system and browser you are
using, the date and time of your visit, data relating to activities on our Sites (e.g., so-called
“clickstream” data) and other technological attributes about your visit to the Sites. We may use
this information to analyze trends, administer the Sites, provide promotional material of interest
to users, track user movements on the Sites and gather aggregate demographic information about
visitors so we can continually improve our Sites.
Cookies and other technologies may also allow our Sites to recognize your computer or device
each time it is used to visit a particular Site, track how you use our Sites, track your preferences
for features and functions and, for our Sites that have registration or similar features, they can
store information such as your user name and password so you don’t have to re-enter them each
time you return to visit.


Third Parties that deliver advertising on our Sites may use cookies and other technologies to
collect user information when users respond to or interact with banner placements. The
information collected does not usually identify you personally, with the potential exception
described in Section 9 regarding The Body PRO.

Internet browser. However, please note, deleting or disabling cookies may affect your ability to
use certain features and functions of our Sites and it may also require you to re-enter certain

for your needs.

Experts” features on The Body Site. Please note that you may not be able to use some Content if
you choose not to provide your Personal Information when requested. If you provide or submit

regulatory or internal audit and record-keeping requirements.

otherwise disclose your Personal Information to unaffiliated entities unless specifically described
here or in any other terms that may apply to your use of a particular Site.
We reserve the right to disclose your Personal Information to any Third Party we engage for the
purpose of administering, operating, configuring site design, maintaining and providing internal
support for our Sites and Content on the Sites. These Third Parties are called “operational service
providers” and provide internal support to operations and activities and for Site design,
development, advertising, hosting and operations. For example, we may employ operational
service providers to send direct emails on our behalf or to provide information technology
support. We may also use operational service providers to display or serve advertising on our
Sites, run promotions, and distribute email messages or web-based newsletters and other
information. We take reasonable efforts to ensure that our operational service providers protect
your privacy, and that they are not permitted to use your Personal Information for their own
marketing or promotional purposes.

following situations:
    •    when compelled by a governmental agency, law, regulation, a court or other legal
         process;
                                                 -3 -


    •   if we believe you are, have or may violate any law, regulation, or our Terms of Use;
    •   to enforce our Terms of Use or any other agreements we may have with you;
    •   if we believe you are or may be a threat to the safety, property, interests or rights of RHM
        or others;
    •   in order to investigate, respond to or resolve problems or inquiries or defend our interests;
    •   in a merger, acquisition, change of control, joint venture or other business combination;
    •   when you otherwise consent.

cookies, pixels and other technologies in an effort to personally identify you. The data they
collect will be used solely for research and measurement purposes.
10.     AGGREGATE OR ANONYMIZED DATA. RHM may, either by itself or in
coordination with its business partners and RHM operational service providers, create aggregate
or anonymized data sets from the Personal Information that we collect. As a general matter,
aggregate and anonymized data sets do not include your Personal Information and cannot be
used to identify you. We may disclose such aggregate or anonymized data sets with our business
partners; for example, our business partners may use such aggregate or anonymized data sets in
order to conduct research and analysis.
11.     REMOVAL OR DELETION OF YOUR INFORMATION/OPTING OUT. In

email.

access to individuals who need to have such access to perform their responsibilities associated
with our Sites and the Content on our Sites. Despite these efforts, no system can ever be 100%
secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee that the Personal Information stored on our servers will
be free from unauthorized access. By using our Sites you are agreeing to assume this risk and
any and all responsibility and liability that may arise.
13.     CORRECTING OR UPDATING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION. If you have
provided your Personal Information to us, you can update or delete it by logging into your

In addition, under California law, website operators are required to disclose how they respond to
web browser “do not track” signals or other similar mechanisms that provide consumers the
ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personal information of a consumer over
time and across third party websites, to the extent the operator engages in that collection. At this
time, we do not track our users’ Personal Information over time and across third-party websites.
This law also requires website operators to disclose whether third parties may collect personal
information about their users’ online activities over time and across different sites when the users
use the operator’s website. We do not knowingly permit third parties to collect Personal
Information about an individual user’s online activities over time and across different web sites
when using our Sites, except as described in Section 9 herein.
