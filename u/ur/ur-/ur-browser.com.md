We reserve the right to periodically amend or revise the Privacy Policy at our sole discretion. Such changes and updates will be effective immediately upon the display of the revised Privacy Policy.

###  2.How does ADAPTIVEBEE treat information while using UR

**A)** Information that identifies you as an individual or may with reasonable effort be used to identify you as an individual ("Personal Information"), can be stored **ONLY IF** voluntarily provided by you in the following events: 

  * (i) Personal Information voluntarily provided by you if and when you contact us, which may include your name and email address, provided that such information will be used solely to communicate with and support you, and will not be shared with any third parties;
  * (ii) Personal Information voluntarily provided by you if and when you choose to become a registered user of the Service;



You do not need to provide any personally identifying information in order to use UR browser to a limited extent, and we do not collect such information.

**B)** Another type of information is browsing data that is stored locally on your device like browsing history information, cookies, add-ons data, download index and other files used in navigation. This data in aggregated Non-Personal Information in most cases, however, sometimes browsing history or the search history contains terms that might identify you. 

We will treat the browsing data as Personal Information. We will not collect any data regarding to this aspect.

At any time, you can choose to delete your browsing history information, in whole or in part. To protect your privacy and provide you with secure browsing experience you can choose to have UR Browser save your passwords for specific websites. Stored passwords can be reviewed in UR Browser settings and will be treated as sensitive and Personal Information with high security standard. You can configure UR Browser through it features to always not accept cookies, block trackers, advertisements from ADAPTIVEBEE or any other sites, or just in certain cases by using private browsing, Ninja Mode, or via specific privacy features provided by UR Browser.

In NinjaMode, private browsing, UR Browser will not store basic browsing history information such as URLs, cached page text, or IP addresses of pages linked from the websites you visit. It will also not store snapshots of pages that you visit or keep a record of your downloads (although this information could still be stored elsewhere on your system, e.g. in a list of recently opened files).

**C)** When you use UR, the only type of information we may collect is non-identifiable aggregated information which is made available via the user use of the Browser ("Non-Personal Information"). We are not aware of the identity of the user from whom the Non-Personal Information is collected. By default, ADAPTIVEBEE receives standard anonymous diagnostic usage data, please refer to Terms for additional info. This information is only used to improve the user experience, to fix and improve the software, retain locally your custom browser services settings. 

If you use UR Browser to access other ADAPTIVEBEE services the fact that you are using UR Browser does not cause ADAPTIVEBEE to receive any special or additional personally identifying information about you.

UR Browser periodically contacts ADAPTIVEBEE to perform functions such as checking for updates, checking connectivity status, validating current time, and estimating the number of active users. Each copy of UR Browser includes a temporary randomly-generated installation number which will be sent to ADAPTIVEBEE when you install and first use the product. The temporary number will be promptly deleted the first time that UR Browser automatically checks for updates. If you received or reactivated your copy of the UR Browser as part of a promotional campaign, it may generate a unique token which is sent to ADAPTIVEBEE when you first run and use the browser after installation, reinstallation, or reactivation. Furthermore, field trials may result in different variations of UR Browser, and UR Browser may send non-unique information to ADAPTIVEBEE about which variation is active;

UR may send technical usage statistics and crash reports to ADAPTIVEBEE. This setting will apply to all users for a given installation of UR Browser. The usage statistics and crash reports help us diagnose problems, help us understand how users interact with UR Browser, and help us improve UR Browser's performance;

UR does not send information that identifies you personally. Crash reports, however, can contain anonymous system information at the time of a malfunction, and errors leading up to a malfunction.

Sites may deposit new cookies on your system while you are in these modes; these cookies will only be temporarily stored and transmitted to sites while you remain in incognito / PrivacySuite medium/high.

Before installing an Add-on, you should review the requested permissions. Add-ons may be designed to store, access, and share data stored locally or in your online accounts. Add-ons may use notifications that are sent through ADAPTIVEBEE servers. UR Browser may check for, download, and install updates to your Add-ons. UR Browser may send usage indicators to ADAPTIVEBEE for installed Add-ons. Some add-ons might require access to a unique identifier for digital rights management or for delivery of push messaging. You can disable the use of such an identifier by removing the add-on from UR Browser.

Add-ons developed and provided by ADAPTIVEBEE may communicate with ADAPTIVEBEE servers and are subject to these Policies unless otherwise indicated.
