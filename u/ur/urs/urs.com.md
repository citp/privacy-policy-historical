# URS Corporation > Privacy Policy Agreement

**Information Collected**

In general, you can visit this Web site ("Site") without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. Our web servers collect the domain names, not the e-mail addresses, of visitors. Our web servers may seek to place a "cookie" (a small data file) on your computer's hard drive which allows the server to determine the computer when it visits again, in order to track statistical information about navigation to and throughout certain areas of our Site, and to URS promotions on other Web sites. This cookie is not used to obtain your name or any personal data, and the information that is tracked is used only for internal purposes. However, if you prefer not to accept cookies, you can set your browser to reject them or to alert you before one is placed.

In addition, there are parts of this Site where we may need to collect personal information from you for a specific purpose, such as to provide you with certain information you request. The information collected from you may include your name, address, telephone, fax number, e-mail address, etc. If you do not provide all the information needed by us we may not be able to give you the information you request. We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from or about children, and we do not knowingly market our products or services to children. 

**Use of Collected Information**

Domain name information that we collect is not used to personally identify you and instead is aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the Site, pages viewed, etc. We use this information to measure the use of our Site and to improve the content of our Site. When other information is collected from you, such as your name and e-mail address, we generally let you know at the time of collection how we will use the personal information. Usually, we use the personal information you provide only to respond to your inquiry or to process your request (such as to receive investor relations materials or inquiry about employment). We may also share your personal information with our subsidiaries or affiliates to enable us to do so. For this purpose, the information you provide may be transferred outside your country to another country that does not have similar data protection legislation and may provide a lower level of protection for your information. However, we have taken certain measures outlined below to try to ensure the security of your information. By submitting any information you consent to these transfers. We may also share your personal information with other companies we have hired to provide services for us. These companies - our vendors - are contractually bound to use personal information we share with them only to perform the services we have hired them to provide. We do not share, sell, or lease personal information about you to any third-parties for their marketing use. We will release information about you if you direct us to do so, if we are required by law to do so, or in other legally limited circumstances (for example, to protect your account from fraud).

**Links to Other Sites**

URS' Site may contain links to other Sites and we try to link only to Sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for the content, security, or 'privacy practices employed by other Web sites.

**Security of Collected Information**

We use all reasonable efforts to maintain physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to protect your personal information from unauthorized or inappropriate access but we not know that the Internet is not a secure medium. We restrict access to information about you to those URS workers who need to know the information to respond to your inquiry or request. Workers who misuse personal information may be subject to disciplinary action.
