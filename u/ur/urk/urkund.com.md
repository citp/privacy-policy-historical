## URKUND and the EU General Data Protection Regulation

Most educational organisations have a purpose description of how and why they manage personal data in the day to day operations and what data processing assistants they use to achieve these. For any service that the school use, where the Service Provider has access to personal data, certain requirements are imposed on you as a data controller. You will, among other things, investigate whether you, via the Service Provider manage personal data – and if so, how you process personal data, what personal data you process and what legal grounds you have for processing personal data.

Your Service Providers should be able to assist you with this. URKUND has its own **[Personal Data Processing Policy](https://secure.urkund.com/static/documents/ENG_URKUND_Policy.pdf)  **and the personal data we process, and how we manage them, are listed therein. In terms of purpose, URKUND does not have its own purpose in this, but deals only with tasks as assigned and instructed by the educational organisations. You will thus need to state in your own purpose description or policy on which legal grounds you allow our management of said data.

### Lawfulness of processing

If you use URKUND, you will process personal information through URKUND, where URKUND is a data processor. Most schools refer to the necessity of being able to check students’ documents so that they do not contain plagiarism – as part of their tasks of assessing and grading – as the legal grounds for doing so. In GDPR there is support for this under Article 6e, that states, “processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller”. Several EU Member States are currently investigating a broader interpretation of Article 6f of the GDPR “General Interest” definition. Schools may also be able to utilize this as legal grounds for processing personal data for the purpose of assessing and grading.

It may be good to know that there is a limited possibility of using _consent_ as legal grounds, since it is not considered valid when there is significant inequality between the data subject and the data controller, therefore such consent cannot be considered voluntary.

Most educational organizations consider it sufficient to describe their purposes and the systems they consider necessary, and thus use, to support these. These systems must then state, in their own policy, and in the Personal data assistant agreement, which personal data are processed, how they are processed and what security measures guards the personal data they have access to.
