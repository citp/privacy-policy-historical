**If you are taking part in Research**

This general information supplements the specific information you have already seen if you are taking part in research studies managed by Research Council Institutes.

UKRI researchers capture and process personal information for the purposes of scientific research using **public task** as a lawful basis. Where researchers are using special categories of personal data (this includes data about your health, ethnicity, political opinions, religious beliefs, etc), the added condition of ‘necessary for scientific research in accordance with safeguards’ is used.

The research team undertaking the project will provide you with information on the types of personal data used in the study.

It is common for personal data for research to be kept for a long time with periodical reviews for the need to keep it, and the law allows for this. It is also common for research to be undertaken jointly with other research organisations. Data may be shared with other credible research teams in universities, commercial companies, health or social service providers, etc, in the UK and abroad. Most of the time the data will be depersonalised so you won’t be identified. If it is personal, there are security, legal and ethical safeguards in place to protect your interests.

If you have any questions about the particular research study you are participating in, please use any contact details that have already been provided.

**Children and Young People**

We may collect personal information about children and young people (such as name, school, age, and characteristics including dietary and/or disability details) to enable us to carry out the aspects of our statutory role relating to education, promotion and public engagement. We may also use that data to inform decisions about funding, future programmes and monitoring and reporting of our activities. Such activities are all considered by UKRI to be in the substantial public interest and further to its statutory foundations using public task or consent as our lawful basis. Where it is appropriate to do so, UKRI will request the consent of the child or young person or a responsible adult.

### How long do we keep your personal information?

We may retain your personal information based upon business requirements, legal obligation, statutory or regulatory obligations and transactional purposes. If you want to know how long we keep your information, please write to our Data Protection Officer.

### Sharing personal information outside of the UK

We are based in the UK, but we also have international representation across the globe. Where we share personal information outside of the UK, we’ll make sure we put in place suitable safeguards to ensure compliance with the GDPR, such as: technical measures, contractual agreements or data sharing agreements.

### Media and images

We process images and recordings for the purposes of CCTV, security, communication and broadcast, general public engagement and health & safety in accordance with the[ Information Commissioner’s Code of Practice](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/cctv/).
