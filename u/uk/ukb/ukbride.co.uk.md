## Personal Information

The site stores personal information of those creating an Eternity membership login name and password. Information pertaining to this will be kept on our servers along with details you submit both relating to your wedding planning and to those who you have entered into our My Guest List, My Table Plan and My Address Book. Brides may send you an email if you choose to publish your email address via the site.

Where you provide personal information, we will use this information to/deliver the services you have requested, and for our internal administration and marketing purposes. We share your personal information with selected third parties to enable us to tailor specific marketing towards you, in the form of emails, brochures, and to a very select quantity of suppliers, your telephone number. If you do not want us to do this please accept the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy and **UNCHECK THE BOX** which says "Please ensure I receive FREE information from UKbride's parners; suppliers of products and services which I may find useful during my wedding planning." If you subsequently feel you no longer wish to have your details passed on please email [datacontroller@whitespacepublishers.co.uk](mailto:datacontroller@whitespacepublishers.co.uk) including the email address that you registered with along with your full postal address and postcode and we will no longer pass on any of your details. You will also need to let these companies know that you would rather not hear from them again, which you can do by simply using the unsubscribe link in any of their emails, or contacting them using the details that will be included in every communication that they send you.

In addition, the site automatically logs the user's IP address and session information such as the duration of the visit and the type of browser used. This is recognised by the Web server and is only used for system administration and to provide statistics, which Whitespace Publishers Ltd may compile to evaluate site use.

Whitespace Publishers Ltd may contact you from time to time via email, post or telephone to offer products or services pertaining to the UKbride site or our high quality magazines. Should you not wish to receive such communications, please inform us by contacting our data controller by emailing [datacontroller@whitespacepublishers.co.uk](mailto:datacontroller@whitespacepublishers.co.uk).
