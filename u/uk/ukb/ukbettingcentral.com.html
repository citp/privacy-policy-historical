<p>This website (the "<strong><u>Site</u></strong>") is operated by UKBettingCentral.com, a division of MMA Associates (Yorkshire) Ltd ("<strong><u>UKBettingCentral.com</u></strong>"). 
<br><br>This Privacy Statement (the "Statement") describes UKBettingCentral.com's collection, use and disclosure of information practices in connection with the Site.  This Statement applies to the international and national version of the Site, located at <a href="http://www.UKBettingCentral.com">www.UKBettingCentral.com</a>, as well as to any versions of the Site that UKBettingCentral.com operates, including versions or pages that UKBettingCentral.com co-brands or private labels with its affiliates, third-party distribution partners and other partners (collectively, "<strong><u>Affiliates</u></strong>"). For example, you may have arrived at a co-branded version of the Site from an Affiliate's website, in which case, that Affiliate will be clearly identified at the top of the home page of this Site.  
<br><br>In this Statement, UKBettingCentral.com refers to those versions of the Site as "<strong><u>Affiliate Versions</u></strong>." Please be aware that UKBettingCentral.com may share any information you submit through this Site with Affiliates, as described below.  During your visit to any Affiliate Version, the Affiliate may independently collect other information from you.
<br><br>For purposes of clarification, this Statement also describes UKBettingCentral.com's collection, use, and disclosure practices with respect to any personally identifiable information and Usage Data (as defined below) that is provided to UKBettingCentral.com by any of its third-party distribution partners that display UKBettingCentral.com listings, such as Yahoo!.
<br><br>This Statement does not describe UKBettingCentral.com's collection, use and disclosure of information through means other than this Site (e.g., off-line) or the collection, use and disclosure practices of any Affiliate, third-party distribution partners or other third parties. For information on a third party's information collection, use and disclosure practices, please review the privacy policy on the applicable third party's website. 
<br><br>Also, please note that this Site contains links to other websites. UKBettingCentral.com is not responsible for the websites, content or privacy practices of any third party. By using this Site, you acknowledge that you have read this Statement and agree that you are subject to the <a title="" href="http://www.ukbettingcentral.com/tos.html" target="">UKBettingCentral.com Terms of Service</a>.
</p><h3><div align="center">Collection of Personally Identifiable Information</div></h3>
You are not required to provide any personally identifiable information to visit the Site. UKBettingCentral.com automatically collects Usage Data (as described below) and may collect ZIP codes and other information in connection with your use of the Site (e.g., the type of affiliate website you are looking for). 
<br><br>UKBettingCentral.com collects personally identifiable information only when you make it available through your use of the Site. You may be required to provide personally identifiable information to use certain services on this Site, including, but not limited to, the "Contact Us" feature or the <a title="UK Betting Forum" href="http://www.ukbettingcentral.com/ukbettingforum/" target="NEW"><strong>UK Betting Forum</strong></a> or <a title="Gambling Tips" href="http://www.gamblingtipsblog.com" target="NEW"><strong>UK Betting Blog</strong></a>. 
<br><br>In addition, you may submit personally identifiable information through the Site in other ways, including: (a) participating in online surveys, promotions, contests and sweepstakes; (b) subscribing to newsletters, editorial content, or promotional content sent via email, (c) using the Site's "Contact" and "More Information" forms; and (d) in connection with other products, services, features, or requests made available through the Site. 
<br><br>We also publish toll-free phone numbers for many of the affilliates that we list or write about on the Site. If you dial one of these phone numbers, UKBettingCentral.com or a service provider operating on UKBettingCentral.com's behalf may record the date, time and length of your call and the phone number from which the call originated, along with other information that may be captured.  Any Usage Data and/or personally identifiable information resulting from such calls may be used as described in this Statement. 
<br><br>The types of personally identifiable information that you provide will depend on the nature of the submission, but could include your name, address, phone number, email address and credit card information. In the event that you purchase an Ad in our website, information may be stored in order to allow UKBettingCentral.com to process and maintain your ad.
<h3><div align="center">Passive Information Collection</div></h3>

<br><br><strong>IP Address Logs:</strong> UKBettingCentral.com also logs Internet Protocol (IP) addresses - the location of your computer on the internet.
<br><br>Cookies allow UKBettingCentral.com to recognize you when you visit the Site, to personalize your experience and generally to serve you better. For example, if you enter your name, address or ZIP code on one of the Site's forms, it may be stored in a cookie so you do not have to enter it again on other forms on the Site. 
<br><br>Cookies and web beacons can tell us what advertising you have seen on the Site, which allows UKBettingCentral.com to offer you a more diverse selection of advertising information and may also be used together to measure the effectiveness of UKBettingCentral.com advertising campaigns.

Web beacons may also be included in emails sent by UKBettingCentral.com to determine when and if such emails are opened or forwarded. 
<br><br>You can disable cookies or otherwise manage them through tools provided with your browser software and with third-party software packages. If you turn off cookies, many of the Site's features will not work as well or at all. Anonymous information regarding use of our Site and services that is collected and/or aggregated by or on behalf of UKBettingCentral.com through the use of such technical means or otherwise is referred to in this Statement as "<strong><u>Usage Data</u></strong>."

</blockquote>
<strong>Usage Data:</strong> Usage Data is used by UKBettingCentral.com for administrative, analytical, research, optimization and other purposes. For example, UKBettingCentral.com may use statistical analyses of Usage Data in order to measure interest in the various areas of the Site, for development purposes and to inform advertisers and partners in aggregate and anonymous terms about consumers who click on their advertising or other messages.

Similarly, if you make a payment to UKBettingCentral.com by credit card, UKBettingCentral.com may share your personally identifiable information and credit card information with a third party in order to process credit card transactions, or such information may be collected directly by the credit card processing service provider on UKBettingCentral.com's behalf. In such cases, UKBettingCentral.com asks that the third party maintain your personally identifiable information as confidential and use the information only to perform the services specified by UKBettingCentral.com.</li>
<li><u>Email List Opt-Outs</u>. In the event UKBettingCentral.com sends promotional emails to you on behalf of third-party advertisers and you inform UKBettingCentral.com you wish to opt out of future promotional emails from a particular third party, UKBettingCentral.com may share your email address with that third party so the third party may add you to its opt-out lists.</li>
