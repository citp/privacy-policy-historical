<p><strong>1. Notification of Changes</strong><br>
This policy may be updated as new features and benefits are added to Ukash or as we adapt based upon suggestions from our customers. If we are going to use or disclose your personally identifiable information in a manner materially different from that stated at the time we collected the information,[ you will be informed of such a change and] you will have a choice as to whether or not we use or disclose your information in this new manner. The amended Privacy Policy will be posted on this Website at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ukash.com">www.ukash.com</a> so that you can always review what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone.</p>

<p>Overall cookies help us to improve the quality of our web site, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us. We know that people have concerns about cookies, but we believe that the benefit we both gain from their proper use is worthwhile and will benefit our end users.</p>
<p>You may set your web browser (Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape navigator) to notify you of cookie placement requests or decline cookies completely. You can delete the files that contain cookies - those files are stored as part of your internet browser.</p>
<p><strong>Customer Service Correspondence</strong><br>

We may, over time, delete these records if permitted by law. </p>
<p><strong>Questionnaires, Surveys, Polls and Profile Data</strong><br>
From time to time, we offer optional questionnaires, surveys and polls to our users for such purposes as collecting demographic information or assessing users' interests and needs. The use of the information collected will be explained in detail in the survey itself.
