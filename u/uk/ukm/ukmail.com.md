Should you breach our terms and conditions or terms of use or if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, we may disclose your information to a relevant authority.

### Cookies

We may create and access cookies (a piece of information like a "tag" which is stored on your computer and allows us to identify if you have visited the Website before) on your PC. Third party advertisers may also create and access cookies, which will be subject to their privacy policies - we accept no responsibility or liability for the use of such third parties' cookies. If you do not wish cookies to be placed on your PC, then they can be disabled in your web browser. The option to do so is normally found in your browser's "security settings" section. However, please note, permanently disabling cookies in your browser may hinder your use of our Website as well as other websites and interactive services.

Security  


At UK Mail we take security very seriously including the use of the online credit card payment facility operated by Online Payments Limited. Your browser will go into secure mode before you enter any payment details. You can check that you are making such payments in a secure environment by looking for either a locked padlock or a key icon in the grey bar at the bottom of your screen or when the address bar goes green.

Being in 'secure mode' means that all of your details are encrypted to help keep them secure. Encryption creates billions of code combinations to protect each transaction made on our Website, so your card details cannot be viewed by anyone else using the Internet.

No credit or debit card details are stored on our servers once your initial payment has been processed. They are stored securely with Online Payments Limited. Once on their systems, all sensitive data is secured using internationally recognised 256-bit encryption standards. 

The encryption keys are held on state-of-the-art, tamper proof systems in the same family as those used to secure VeriSign's Global Root certificate, making them all but impossible to extract. The data they hold is extremely secure and they are regularly audited by the banks and banking authorities to ensure it remains so.

If you have any further concerns about security, please email our Customer Service team at   
marketing@ukmail.com or use [our contact us form ](https://web.archive.org/need-help/contact-us)
