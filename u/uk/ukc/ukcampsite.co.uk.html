<p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. We may collect information about you to provide you with the best possible service , and we will only use the information that we collect about you lawfully.
</p><p>We collect the following information from you if you register:<br><br>
Your email address: This will not be shown anywhere on our website. We will not pass on your e-mail details to any other organisation. We use your email address to confirm registration and to send you updates on the site, when you request reminders, or other information from our site to be sent to you. Your chosen username: We use this as a means of recording membership. Other information: You may also make the following information available to us but this is not a requirement for registration, only if you wish it to appear on your profile: your location, interests, your unit. No other information is collected, or required.
<br><br>External Links
<br><br>This Site may contain links to other websites of third parties. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of those other sites
<br><br>Disclosure of information

</p><h3>Cookie Policy</h3>
Like most websites, this one uses cookies.<br><br>Cookies are small text files stored on your computer by your browser. They’re used for many things, such as remembering whether you’ve visited the site before, so that you remain logged in - or to help us work out how many new website visitors we get each month. They contain information about the use of your computer but don’t include personal information about you. You can think of cookies as providing a "memory" for the website, enabling it to recognise a user and respond appropriately. Each web domain can only access cookies stored by that specific web domain, meaning that only the ukcampsite.co.uk servers can access the cookies set by the ukcampsite.co.uk domain.
<br><br>
By accessing the Website, you agree that this Cookie Policy will apply whenever you access the Website on any device.
<!--Any changes to this policy will be posted here. We reserve the right to vary this Cookie Policy from time to time and such changes shall become effective as soon as they are posted. Your continued use of the Website constitutes your agreement to all such changes. This policy was last updated on 26th May 2012 to reflect changes in the law on cookies used on websites.-->
<br><br><b>Our use of cookies</b><br><br>
We do not recommend turning cookies off when visiting ukcampsite.co.uk, as this will prevent you from registering, signing in, and using many of the services on the site. Basically the site won't work properly! If you are primarily concerned about third party cookies generated by advertisers, you can turn these off by going to the third party's websites above and getting them to generate a one-time "no thanks" cookie, which will stop any further cookies being served to your machine.<br><br>
A visit to a page on ukcampsite.co.uk may generate the following types of cookie:<p></p><p>Google analytics cookies:</p><p>These monitor how visitors move around the Website and how they reached it. This is used so that we can see total (not individual) figures on which types of content users enjoy most, for instance. These cookies can tell us whether or not you've visited the site before. This allows us to track how many individual unique users we have, and how often they visit the site. These cookies cannot be used to identify individuals; they are used for statistical purposes only. You can opt out of these if you want: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">Google: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a></p>
<p>Registration and Functionality cookies
</p><p>When you register with ukcampsite.co.uk, we generate cookies that represent whether you are signed in or not. Our servers use these cookies to work which account you are signed in with, and if you are allowed access to a particular service.<!-- Unless you click "Remember me" when you sign in, some of these cookies get deleted when you either close your browser or shut down your computer.--> Some cookies are set to remember your preferences, eg the background colour, the last time you viewed the forums so that you can see the latest posts, whether you want maps to be shown by default etc.</p>
<p>Third party advertising cookies</p><p>ukcampsite.co.uk serve elements of pages from multiple sources, and so after visiting you may see other cookies from third parties. Some of these third parties use their own anonymous cookies to track how many people have seen a particular ad, or to track how many people have seen it more than once. The companies that generate these cookies have their own privacy policies, and ukcampsite.co.uk has no access to read or write these cookies.

<p>Other third party cookies</p><p>Social sharing, video and other services we offer are run by other companies who may put cookies on your computer when you use them on our site, or if you are already logged in to them. ukcampsite.co.uk cannot access these cookies, nor can the third parties access the data in cookies used by ukcampsite.co.uk. Here you can find out more about specific services that we may use and their use of cookies:<br>Facebook’s data use policy: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/your-info-on-other" target="_blank">http://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/your-info-on-other</a>

</p><p>Advertising cookies</p><p>Sometimes we need to know whether or not you've seen an advert or a type of advert, and how long it is since you've seen it. In order to do this, we place a cookie on your machine when we show you some types of advertising. These cookies are anonymous, they simply count page views.
</p><p><b>Using your browser to control cookies</b></p>Most internet browsers accept cookies automatically, but you can change the settings of your browser to erase cookies or prevent automatic acceptance if you prefer. These settings will typically be found in the 'options' or 'preferences' menu of your browser. These links explain how you can control cookies via your browser – remember that if you turn off cookies in your browser then these settings apply to all websites not just this one.<p></p>
