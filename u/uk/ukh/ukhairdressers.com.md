* How will we use the information we collect?

**Marketing newsletters**

These communications will include notification of the latest hairstyles added to our style gallery, new hair and beauty articles you may be interested in and our current competitions. This information is stored securely on our server. You can unsubscribe from these emails at any time by following the link at the bottom of the email.

**Competitions**

When you enter a competition on our site we collect your name, email address and postal address. This is so we can contact you if you win and send you your prize. Additionally, we ask you to tell us your gender and whether or not you have used the brand of products offered as the competition prize. This additional information is used to create anonymous data, to increase our understanding of who is entering our competitions; for example, the proportion of men and women entering. None of these figures are linked to any information that is personally identifiable. 

If you win a prize, we will contact you by email to inform you. Your name and postal address will then be shared with the company providing the prize, so that they can send it to you. The winner's name and town of residence are recorded on a list of competition winners which we keep for our records. Once the prizes have been sent out, all other personal information from competition entrants is deleted.

If you choose to submit a question to one of our hair experts, we ask you to provide us with your name and email address. Your personal information is retained until an expert has answered your question. We delete this information after we have contacted you to notify you that the answer is available to view on our website. Your first name is published on the website, alongside your question. If you do not want us to publish your name with your question, you can notify us of this when you submit your question.
