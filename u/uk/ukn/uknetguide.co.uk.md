We have registered with and notified the Data Protection Commissioner of our practice affecting personal data. 

This statement discloses the cookie and privacy policy for the UK Net Guide network of sites, which encompass the site [http://www.uknetguide.co.uk](http://www.uknetguide.co.uk/) and all co-branded versions of this site that collectively form and are referred to as the UK Net Guide network.

##  What is a Cookie?

Cookies are small text files which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on you computer's hard drive by your browser. They're used for many things, such as remembering whether you've visited the site before, and to help us work out how many new website visitors we get each month. They contain information about the use of your computer **but don't include personal information about you** (they don't store your name, for instance). 

You can read all about cookies here: [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/)

##  About our Cookie Policy

Cookies do not damage your computer. Each web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.

The UK Net Guide network uses cookies to assign identification to your individual browser. This identifies your browser - but not you - to our servers every time you visit our network. Cookies by themselves cannot be used to find out the identity of any user. Unless you voluntarily advise us, the **UK Net Guide network will never know who you are, even though we assign your browser a cookie**. 

You can decide if you want to accept cookies by changing the settings on your browser to either accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set.

**The below links explain how you can control cookies via your web browser** \- remember that if you turn off cookies in your browser then these settings apply to all websites not just to UK Net Guide:

The information gathered through the use of cookies, allows the UK Net Guide network to offer a quality Internet service and easily accessible online content to our users, and catalogue traffic patterns throughout the network in a manner that provides personal privacy protection. 

We also keep track of your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our web site. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information about you, such as your location and your Internet Service Provider. The UK Net Guide network may also collect aggregate information on how our users are utilising the site. This might include information regarding traffic patterns through the sites. 

Other organisations that place advertising on our network also have the ability to assign a different cookie to your browser in a process that the UK Net Guide network does not control. Again, unless you voluntarily advise them, these advertisers will also never know who you are.

We sell advertising space on UK Net Guide as we don't charge for content.  
As part of our advertising solution, we use several services that from time to time may help us and advertisers understand what adverts you might be interested in. These cookies hold information about the computer - they don't hold personal information about you (ie it's not linked to you as an individual). But they might hold a record of what other websites you've looked at - so we may show you a car advert if you've previously visited a motoring website.  
These are the services we use and how you can control those cookies. Please note that turning off advertising cookies won't mean that you are not served any advertising merely that it will not be tailored to your interests.
