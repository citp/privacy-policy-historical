If you choose to pay someone else, for example, add a payment recipient on our website, we will ask you for your recipient’s name, email address, bank account information and physical address. This is necessary for us to make a payment to them and you confirm that you know they agree or that you are otherwise allowed to give us this information.

[Find out more information on the use of your personal data by the credit reference agencies](https://www.callcredit.co.uk/legal-information/bureau-privacy-notice/).

We will make reasonable efforts to tell you if we have collected personal information about you from someone else.

• For security purposes and to verify your identity,  
• For administration, planning and account management,

We may disclose information about you, including your personal information, to the following if you ask us to, it’s required to provide the product or service to you, if we have a duty to disclose it, a law or regulation allow us to do so or for legitimate business reasons:  
• Other companies in the OFX Group (the “OFX Group” includes us, our parent company, OzForex Limited, and its other subsidiaries),To our service providers, partners  
and agents (including their sub-contractors), including, web hosting, IT systems administrators, mailing houses, debt collectors, and professional advisors,

 The personal information that we collect from you may be transferredto, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area

(“EEA”), for example a country where you have instructed us to send a payment. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our service providers and including in countries such as Australia, United States, Canada and Hong Kong. Such staff are likely to be involved in, among other things, processing your transaction or payment details and providing support services. By giving your personal information, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing.  


Where we share information with an organisation outside the EEA, we will take all reasonable steps to ensure that they apply equivalent levels of protection as we are required to provide. If this is not possible, for example, we are required by law to disclose your information, we will make sure that sharing the information is lawful.

If we wish to provide your personal information to anyone else, we will identify them and obtain your consent before doing so, unless the provision of that information to that third party is permitted by law.

**How long we keep information**  
We need to keep your information so that we can provide our services to you. Under relevant anti-money laundering and counterterrorism legislation we need to keep your personal information and information about your transactions for at least 5 years from the end of your relationship with us. We may also need to keep it for longer for legitimate business purposes and for other legal and regulatory reasons.
