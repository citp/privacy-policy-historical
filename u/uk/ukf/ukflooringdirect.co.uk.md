We store your personal details on a secure server.  We use industry standard security and firewalls on our servers.  When we collect payment card details electronically, we use encryption by using “HSBC Secure” epayments section.  Whilst we are unable to guarantee 100% security, this makes it hard for a hacker to decrypt your details.

We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of your information.  Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you.

You are responsible for protecting against unauthorised access to your password and to your computer.

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of the Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure.

Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
