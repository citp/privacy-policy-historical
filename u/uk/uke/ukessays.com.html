<h1>UK Essays Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>UK Essays is a website belonging to All Answers Limited, a UK Registered Company (No. 4964706).  We take the privacy of your information very seriously.</p>

<p>Our privacy policy below explains how we will collect and use the information you give us. We may vary this policy from time to time and the current version will be that published on this site. The word 'we' refers to All Answers Limited, unless otherwise indicated.</p>

<h2>Collecting your information</h2>

<p>From time to time, you will be asked to submit personal information about yourself (e.g. name and email address etc) in order to receive or use services on our website(s). This may happen, for example, when you make a purchase from us, when you apply to be a writer, when you subscribe to a newsletter, when you enter a competition or when you register for personalised services such as your customer control panel.</p>

<p>We will also need personal information in order to supply our products and services to you, and sometimes to help us identify you when you contact us. When we collect this information we will take reasonable measures to ensure that it is transmitted to us securely.  We will only collect payment information over a secure connection.</p>

<p>If you communicate with us by email over the Internet you should be aware that the nature of the Internet is such that unencrypted communication may not be secure and may pass through several different countries on route to us. Please do not email us with confidential or sensitive information such as your credit card details. We cannot accept responsibility for unauthorised access to your information that is outside our control.</p>

<p>We may combine this information with other information that we may hold about you if you are an existing customer, or have made enquiries of us before.</p>

<p>We will act in accordance with current legislation and we will maintain a link to our privacy policy, which includes our Data Protection Notice, in a prominent place on our website.</p>

<h3>UK Essays Data Protection Notice</h3>

<p>Unlike many reputable (and many more not so reputable) companies who trade on the Internet, we will <strong><u>NEVER</u></strong> share the information you provide, together with other information, with any other company.</p>

<p>We may use the information you provide for administration, marketing, customer services and profiling your purchasing preferences.  However, we promise not to send you more than four marketing communications per month, and we promise to give you the ability to stop receiving marketing communications at any time.</p>

<p>For information about the way we use cookies and other web tracking devices please refer to the sections below in this privacy policy.</p>

<p>If you give us information about another person, in doing so you confirm that they have given you permission to provide it to us and for us to be able to process their personal data (including sensitive personal data) and also that you have told them who we are and what we will use their data for, as set out in this notice.</p>

<p>You have the right to ask for a copy of your information (for which we reserve the right to charge a small fee) and to correct any inaccuracies.</p>

<p>For our joint protection and training purposes, telephone calls may be recorded and/or monitored.</p>

<h3>Informing you about products and services</h3>

<p>We offer student education related products such as plagiarism software, past papers, marking and proofreading services. By providing us with your contact details, you will be indicating to us your consent to us contacting you by mail, telephone, fax, email, and SMS/MMS to let you know about any goods, services or promotions of our own which may be of interest to you unless you indicate an objection to receiving such messages.</p>

<p>As stated in our Data Protection Notice, we will never send you more than four marketing communications per month (in practice, we rarely send out more than one marketing communication per month) and we will always give you the opportunity of opting out of such marketing communications.</p>

<h3>Sensitive data</h3>

<p>You may be asked on the telephone to give your credit or debit card details for the purpose of paying for a service you have requested from us.  You will always have the option to enter these through our website instead, which uses Barclay's Secure Merchant Services.  We also accept Paypal payments which do not require you to hand over your credit or debit card details.</p>

<p>We never store customers' sensitive data - for example, credit or debit card details.</p>

<p>If you are a writer for our company, you acknowledge that to speed up the processing of your invoices, we need to store your bank details as supplied by you.  We promise to take all reasonable precautions to ensure these are kept safe.</p>

<h3>How we collect information about your visits to our websites</h3>

<p>When you visit our web pages, we may check your IP address to determine your location. This helps us give you content relevant to where you are located.</p>

<p>We may put something called a `cookie' on your computer.  Thousands of reputable websites use cookies and you should not be alarmed by this.  They help us track how often you visit the website.  They also help us confirm your identity when you log into our website, and they help us determine whether you are logged in or logged out.</p>

<p>Some of our websites use analytics software which records non-personal statistical information about what you do on the website. For example: the duration of time a page was viewed, common paths taken through the site, data on screen settings and other general information.  None of this information is person-specific.</p>

<h2>What will we do with your personal information?</h2>

<p>We will only use your information for the purposes that you would reasonably anticipate or that we state when we collect it and, where necessary, for which you have given us your consent. We will not contact you, or pass your information to any other person or company, ever.</p>

<p>We are committed to treating your personal data with due care and in accordance with the data protection principles.  In addition, you will see that our privacy policy is far more protective than many major companies, who often reserve the right to pass your details to third parties for marketing.</p>

<h3>How to access your personal information</h3>

<p>If you would like to see a copy of the information that we hold for you, please email our enquiries team, and mark your email for the attention of the legal department.  We reserve the right to ask you to provide certain information to help us confirm your identity.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to charge a small fee for the provision of this information, although we will probably not do so.</p>

<p>If you believe that any of the data we hold about you is incorrect or being misused or want further information you may contact us at our enquiries email address.</p>

<h3>Users aged 16 years and under</h3>

<p>If you are 16 or under you must have permission from a parent or guardian before you give us personal information. If we find that we have received information from you without the appropriate consent, we reserve the right to cancel all transactions and services and remove all personal data that you have supplied. You will be able to re-submit the information when you have the required permission.</p>

<h3>What is a cookie?</h3>

<p>Cookies are text files that identify your computer (through what is known as an IP address) to our server. </p>

<p>You generally have the opportunity to set your computer to accept all cookies, to notify you when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. You can do this through your Internet browser. With most browsers, this facility can be reached via the `tools' (e.g. Internet Explorer), or `edit', or 'task' (e.g. Netscape) menu. If you have any problems finding this area, the `help' function within your browser will be able to provide assistance.</p>

<p>If you refuse a cookie it may prevent the proper operation of the site or even prevent your access to certain areas.  The customer login area, for example, relies on cookies to help identify you, and to identify if you are logged in or logged out at any time.</p>

<p><a href="/cookie-info.php" title="Cookie information" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Click here for more information about the cookies we use on this website.</a></p>

<h2>Links to other websites</h2>

<p>Our websites may contain links to other sites outside the group. All Answers Limited is not responsible for the privacy and security of these sites unless they belong to All Answers. This privacy policy applies only to All Answers Limited Websites.</p>

<p>If you are unsure whether a website belongs to All Answers Limited or not, just email our enquiries email address, or give us a call.</p>  

<p>If you have any more questions about the way we handle data, please call or email us. If you have a more in-depth question, please email our enquiries address, marked for the attention of the legal department.</p>
