Ujena recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of all information provided by users of our websites. We created the following policy guidelines with a fundamental respect for our users right to privacy to guide our relationships with our users. 

**Information Collected by Ujena**

Ujena collects information about users during their registration for some of our websites; their participation in certain activities on our websites, including the use of cookies. When users request pages from our server, our Web server automatically collects some information about the users, including their IP addresses. These addresses are used by computers on the network to send the requested pages to users. In order to access certain portions of our websites, users must register and provide certain voluntary information about themselves. 

**Use of Information**

Ujena will not reveal any personal information that users provide to us to any third party without their permission. Ujena uses users IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. We also use it to gather broad demographic information about our users in general. This information does not contain anything that can identify users personally. We may combine demographic information supplied by a subscriber at registration with site usage data to provide profiles, in aggregate form, about our users and their preferences in the content of the site and advertising. We may share this composite information with our advertisers to help them better understand our services, but Ujena does not give advertisers information about individual users of our web sites. 

If you purchase an item or service from any of our web sites, you will be required to submit personal contact, shipping and billing information in order to complete the transaction. This information may be shared with third party entities such as shipping companies, merchant account and payment gateway service providers, and our product distributors. Only the information necessary to complete the transaction shall be disclosed. 

Although Ujena does not specifically seek to obtain any information from children, there are certain areas of our websites that children may visit. We urge children only to give us any information after they have discussed it with their parents. 

**General**

Ujena is not responsible for the content or the privacy polices of websites to which it may provide links or the websites of its advertisers. Ujena uses reasonable precautions to keep the personal information disclosed to us secure and to disclose such information only to responsible third parties after permission from the user. If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site or your dealings with Ujena, you can contact: privacy@ujena.com via email or (800) 448-5362.
