			<h2>UJAM, Inc. Privacy Policy (Effective as of August 24, 2010)</h2>

		    <p>
		    	<strong>
		    	We at UJAM, Inc. have created this Privacy Policy to
				explain how we collect, process, use and share information we obtain
				through our web site located at www.UJAM.com (the "UJAM Site"), and any
				other Internet products and services we may offer (together, the
				"Internet Products").
				</strong>
		    </p>

		    <p>
			    This Privacy Policy does not govern our
				use of any information you provide to us when you call us, write to us,
				or communicate with us in any manner other than through the Internet
				Products. Because the Internet is global, information about you that we
				collect or that you submit may be transferred to, processed in, and held
				in countries (including the United States) other than the one in which
				you reside.
			</p>

		    <p>
		    	<strong>
		    	By using the UJAM Site, you explicitly consent to the
				collection, processing and use of your personal information and agree to
				the terms of this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is effective as of
				August 24, 2010</strong>
		    </p>

		    <h3 class="section-header">Information you choose to submit</h3>
		    <p>
		    	<strong>
		    	You can visit the UJAM Site without telling us who you are or revealing to us any
		    	information by which someone could personally identify you (which we will refer to
		    	in this Privacy Policy collectively as "Identifiable Personal Data").
		    	</strong>
		    </p>
		    <p>
		    	However, to
		    	obtain access to certain areas of the UJAM Site (e.g., chat rooms, bulletin boards
		    	and other online forums), to receive certain services we provide (e.g., e-mail
		    	newsletters), to make a purchase from the UJAM Site, to register a product with us,
		    	or to participate in contests we may offer from time to time, you may be required
		    	to provide certain Personal Data as well as information about yourself (for example
		    	your gender, birth date, or zip code) by which it is impossible or substantially
		    	more difficult for a third party to personally identify you without additional
		    	information (which we will refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as
		    	"Pseudonymized Personal Data").
			</p>

			<h3 class="section-header">Collection and use of personal data</h3>
		    <p>
				We use Personal Data and Pseudonymized Personal Data (which we
				will refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as "Personal Data") to
				conclude contractual relationships with you and to fulfill your requests for
				products and services, to monitor and improve our UJAM Site, products, and services,
				and to contact you from time to time about us, the UJAM Site, and our products and
				services.  We do not use Personal Data for any other purpose.
		    </p>

		    <h3 class="section-header">Information we automatically collect</h3>
		    <p>
		    	<strong>
		    	We automatically collect certain information to help us understand how you use the
		    	UJAM Site (which we will refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as "Usage Data").
		    	</strong>
		    </p>
		    <p>
		    	For example, each time you visit the UJAM Site we may automatically collect your IP
		    	address, browser type, browser, browser language and computer type, access time and date,
		    	the webpage from which you came, and
		    	the webpage(s) that you access during your visit as well as other web server log files.
		    	Such Usage Data is collected, in particular, for the safety and protection of the UJAM site.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		    	We also may use cookies (which are
		    	small amounts of data sent from a web server to your browser that are stored on your
		    	computer's hard drive) and web beacons (which are invisible files located on webpages
		    	that you visit) to keep track of your use of the UJAM Site, to validate your identity,
		    	to remember your password and preferences, to tailor the UJAM Site to meet your personal
		    	interests and needs, for our own market research purposes, to provide advertisements
		    	that we believe you may be interested in, for billing purposes, and to improve the
		    	quality of the UJAM Site.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		    	In addition, third
		    	parties who place advertisements on the UJAM Site may also collect information through
		    	cookies and web beacons to ensure that their advertising systems and technologies work
		    	properly and to allow them to track responses to their advertisements. Cookies and web
		    	beacons set by these third parties are governed by the privacy policies of those third
		    	parties.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		    	Generally, you can set your browser not to accept cookies or to notify you if
		    	you are sent a cookie, giving you the opportunity to choose whether or not to accept
		    	the cookie.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		    	<strong>
		    	Please note that if you do set your browser not to accept cookies, certain
		    	areas of the UJAM Site and accompaniment service may not function properly.
		    	We may combine Usage Data with
		    	Personal Data in a manner that enables us to trace Usage Data to an individual user.
		    	</strong>
		    </p>

		    <h3 class="section-header">Our information sharing practices</h3>

		    <h3 class="section-header">Generally</h3>
		    <p>
		    	Except as otherwise described in this section of our Privacy Policy,
		    	we will not share your Personal Data or Usage Data (which we will refer to in this Privacy
		    	Policy collectively as "User Information") with any third party without your permission.
		    </p>

		    <h3 class="section-header">Advertisers</h3>
		    <p>
		    	From time to time, we may share your Pseudonymized Personal Data including
		    	Usage Data to enable third parties who serve advertisements on the UJAM Site to deliver
		    	advertisements that will be relevant to you.
		    </p>

		    <h3 class="section-header">Aggregated data</h3>
		    <p>
		    	From time to time, we may share aggregated User Information
		    	(excluding any credit card numbers you may provide to us to purchase any of our products
		    	or services) with third parties. We will not share any aggregated data, however, in manner
		    	that would enable the recipient to personally identify you.
		    </p>

		    <h3 class="section-header">Third-party marketers</h3>
		    <p>
		    	If you affirmatively authorize us to do so, from time to time
		    	we may share your Personal Data with third parties so they may contact you regarding goods
		    	or services in which you may be interested. If you have authorized us to do, and later decide
		    	that you would no longer like us to disclose your Personal Data to third parties for the third
		    	parties' direct marketing purposes, please contact us as noted below in "Choice/Opt-Out."
		    </p>

		   <h3 class="section-header">Other disclosure scenarios</h3>
		    <p>
		    	<strong>
		    	Notwithstanding anything in this Privacy Policy to the
		    	contrary, we reserve the right, and you hereby expressly authorize us to, share any User
		    	Information:
		    	</strong>
		    </p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish,
					protect, or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims,
					or where disclosure is otherwise required by law;
				</li>
				<li>
					if we believe it is
					necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, fraud,
					or situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person or property;
				</li>
				<li>
					if we
					believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding abuse of the UJAM
					Site infrastructure or the Internet in general (such as voluminous spamming, denial of service
					attacks, or attempts to compromise the security of information);
				</li>
				<li>
					to our parent company,
					subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with us (in which case
					we will require such entities to honor this Privacy Policy);
				</li>
				<li>
					with potential acquirers or others involved in such transaction if we (or substantially all
					of our assets) are acquired by or merged with another entity; or
				</li>
				<li>
					with third parties who provide services to us (e.g., credit card
					processing services, shipping services, or data management and storage services or other
					services required for the operation of the UJAM Site); provided,
					however, that in those circumstances we request that our service providers not share your User
					Information in a manner inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.
				</li>
			</ol>

		    <h3 class="section-header">Public Areas</h3>
		    <p>
		    	There may be areas of the UJAM Site that (e.g., chat rooms, bulletin boards, and other online
		    	forums) in which you are able to post information that will be available to all other users of
		    	the UJAM Site. By choosing to use these areas, you understand and agree that anyone may access,
		    	use, and disclose any information that you post to those areas.
		    </p>

		    <h3 class="section-header">Access to personal data; modifying and deleting your personal data</h3>
		    <p>
		    	You may have certain rights under applicable data protection laws which may include the right
		    	for you to receive a copy of the personal data that UJAM holds about you, including information
		    	relating to the source of the data, the recipients to whom data are transferred, and the purpose
		    	of recording the data. For a copy of your personal data or other information you are entitled to
		    	request, please contact UJAM at the e-mail address set out below. We may charge you a nominal
		    	fee for complying with such a request in accordance with applicable law. In addition, you may
		    	have a right to request that personal data is corrected, blocked or deleted if the data is
		    	factually incorrect, incomplete or irrelevant for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
		    	If you would like to modify or delete from our database any Personal Data you previously
		    	submitted to us, please let us know by accessing and updating your profile. Please note that any
		    	Personal Data that we have copied may remain in back-up storage for some period of time after
		    	your request, and that if you delete certain information you may not be able to order services
		    	in the future without re-submitting such information. Also, please note that we will maintain
		    	Personal Data in our database whenever we are required to do so by law.
		    </p>

		    <h3 class="section-header">Newsletters</h3>
		    <p>
		    	When you sign up to be on a mailing list for UJAM's e-mail newsletters, your e-mail address and
		    	selected newsletter list(s) are stored by us. We use this information solely for purposes of
		    	dispatching newsletters. Data sets are used to analyze system performance for statistical
		    	purposes. We neither pass on this data to third parties nor use it for any other purposes
		    	of our own.
		    </p>

		    <h3 class="section-header">Choice/Opt-Out</h3>
		    <p>
		    	We offer you the opportunity to control whether we share your Personal Data with third parties
		    	for their direct marketing purposes. You may request that we do so at the time you register to
		    	become a member of the UJAM Site or at any time thereafter by accessing and updating your privacy
		    	settings through your profile page. In addition, if you have previously authorized us to do, you
		    	may request that we no longer share your Personal Data with third parties for their direct
		    	marketing purposes by accessing and updating your privacy settings through your profile page.
		    	Please note that sometimes these requests may take up to ten business days to process and that we
		    	are not responsible for removing information about you from the database of any third party to
		    	whom we were authorized to disclose your Personal Data prior to processing your request.
		    </p>

		    <h3 class="section-header">Security</h3>
		    <p>
		    	We have implemented reasonable measures to help protect your User Information from loss, misuse,
		    	or unauthorized access or disclosure. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the
		    	Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your User
		    	Information, we cannot guarantee its security.
		    </p>

		    <h3 class="section-header">Links</h3>
		    <p>
		    	The UJAM Site may contain links to other web sites. We are not responsible for the privacy
		    	practices of any such other web site (whether accessed through an advertisement, service, or
		    	content link) and urge you to review such practices prior to submitting any information to such
		    	web sites.
		    </p>

		    <p>
		    	We are committed to protecting the privacy needs of children and we encourage parents and
		    	guardians to take an active role in their children's online activities and interests. The UJAM
		    	Site is not intended for and may not be used by children under the age of 13. We do not
		    	knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13 and we do not target the UJAM

		    	change via email or by posting a notice on relevant areas of the UJAM Site. Any updated
		    	version of this Privacy Policy will be effective as of the date set forth therein.
		    </p>

		    <h3 class="section-header">Storage of user information</h3>
		    <p>
		    	After termination of the user relationship, the User Information will be blocked. Upon
		    	termination of the user relationship, the user's account and all User Information will be
		    	deleted within 30 days. Deletion will be carried out within six (6) months after the
		    	invoice has been sent to the user. If objections are raised against the invoice or if it
		    	has not been paid within such six (6) months period, the user's User Information will
		    	remain stored until the objection against the invoice is resolved or full payment claim
		    	has been received. Even after that point of time, the registration data (excluding the
		    	account name, e-mail address and Usage Data) can be stored by UJAM in anonymized form and
		    	can be used by UJAM for market research, advertising and other business purposes or
