**UJAM, INC.** **PRIVACY POLICY**  
**(Effective as of August 24, 2010)**

**We at UJAM, Inc. have created this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect, process, use and share information we obtain through our web site located at www.UJAM.com (the "UJAM Site"), and any other Internet products and services we may offer (together, the "Internet Products").**

This Privacy Policy does not govern our use of any information you provide to us when you call us, write to us, or communicate with us in any manner other than through the Internet Products. Because the Internet is global, information about you that we collect or that you submit may be transferred to, processed in, and held in countries (including the United States) other than the one in which you reside. 

**By using the UJAM Site, you explicitly consent to the collection, processing and use of your personal information and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is effective as of August 24, 2010.**

**INFORMATION YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT**

**You can visit the UJAM Site without telling us who you are or revealing to us any information by which someone could personally identify you (which we will refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as "Identifiable Personal Data").**

However, to obtain access to certain areas of the UJAM Site (e.g., chat rooms, bulletin boards and other online forums), to receive certain services we provide (e.g., e-mail newsletters), to make a purchase from the UJAM Site, to register a product with us, or to participate in contests we may offer from time to time, you may be required to provide certain Personal Data as well as information about yourself (for example your gender, birth date, or zip code) by which it is impossible or substantially more difficult for a third party to personally identify you without additional information (which we will refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as "Pseudonymized Personal Data"). 

**COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL DATA**

We use Personal Data and Pseudonymized Personal Data (which we will refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as "Personal Data") to conclude contractual relationships with you and to fulfill your requests for products and services, to monitor and improve our UJAM Site, products, and services, and to contact you from time to time about us, the UJAM Site, and our products and services. We do not use Personal Data for any other purpose. 

**INFORMATION WE AUTOMATICALLY COLLECT**

**We automatically collect certain information to help us understand how you use the UJAM Site (which we will refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as "Usage Data").**

For example, each time you visit the UJAM Site we may automatically collect your IP address, browser type, browser, browser language and computer type, access time and date, the webpage from which you came, and the webpage(s) that you access during your visit as well as other web server log files. Such Usage Data is collected, in particular, for the safety and protection of the UJAM site. 

We also may use cookies (which are small amounts of data sent from a web server to your browser that are stored on your computer's hard drive) and web beacons (which are invisible files located on webpages that you visit) to keep track of your use of the UJAM Site, to validate your identity, to remember your password and preferences, to tailor the UJAM Site to meet your personal interests and needs, for our own market research purposes, to provide advertisements that we believe you may be interested in, for billing purposes, and to improve the quality of the UJAM Site. 

In addition, third parties who place advertisements on the UJAM Site may also collect information through cookies and web beacons to ensure that their advertising systems and technologies work properly and to allow them to track responses to their advertisements. Cookies and web beacons set by these third parties are governed by the privacy policies of those third parties. 

Generally, you can set your browser not to accept cookies or to notify you if you are sent a cookie, giving you the opportunity to choose whether or not to accept the cookie. 

**Please note that if you do set your browser not to accept cookies, certain areas of the UJAM Site and accompaniment service may not function properly. We may combine Usage Data with Personal Data in a manner that enables us to trace Usage Data to an individual user.**

**OUR INFORMATION SHARING PRACTICES**

**ADVERTISERS**
