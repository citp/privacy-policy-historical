					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="noMargin">Ulteem upholds the strictest French and European standards with respect to the protection of privacy and of personal data, and has made a declaration to the French data protection authority (Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés - CNIL) under number 1107043.</p>
					<p>Some information, comments or content (photographs) that you optionally provide may possibly, under your responsibility and on your initiative, reveal your ethnic origin, nationality, religion and/or sexual orientation. By providing such information, on an optional basis, you manifest your intention and, consequently, expressly consent to, and take sole responsibility for, the processing of this said "sensitive" data by Ulteem, and freely take exclusive responsibility therefor.</p>
					<p>Members may access or request access to their personal information in order to have it modified or deleted or to forbid Ulteem from using it by writing to Ulteem at BP 109, 92106 Boulogne Cedex or by filling in the contact form, clearly specifying their personal login information.</p>
					<p>Members may, at the time of registration or at any time thereafter, request to receive and, subsequently, request without charge via Ulteem to cease to receive, the Ulteem newsletter and/or promotional offers sent to them by e-mail by Ulteem (a meetic™ service) and/or meetic's partners. The rights and warranties of Ulteem Members comply inter alia with French Data Protection Act no. 78-17 dated 6 January 1978, as amended by Act no. 2004-801 dated 6 August 2004 transposing into French law EU Directive 95/46/EC dated 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and privacy within the European Union and the French Act on "confidence in the digital economy", no. 2004-575 dated 21 June 2004 (article L. 33-4-1, as amended, of the Post and Electronic Communications Code and the new article L. 121-20-5 of the French Consumer Code) transposing into French law EU Directive 2000/31/EC dated 8 June 2000 on electronic commerce and EU Directive 2002/58/EC dated 12 July 2002 on the protection of personal data and privacy in electronic communications.</p>

					<a name="ART5-1"></a><h2>1. When and why do we gather information about you?</h2>
					<p class="noMargin">Members are asked to supply information about themselves when they register with the Service, participate in a contest, respond to a survey or acquire a Subscription. Certain items of information are mandatory in order to gain access to the Services.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<a name="ART5-2"></a><h2>2. What type of information do we gather?</h2>
					<p class="noMargin">Personal information gathered by Ulteem can include your name, postal and/or e-mail address, bank details, information about your physical appearance, photographs or videos showing you, your personal values, your answers to the Ulteem Test, your philosophy and religion, your ethnic origin, your interests and your use of the Service.</p>
					<p>Furthermore, certain non-personal information is also gathered, such as the version of yours and any other visitor's web browser (Netscape, Internet Explorer, etc.), the operating system (Windows 98, Mac Os, etc.) and the IP address of the computer from which you are visiting the site.</p>
					<p>Ulteem uses cookies, designed to store information used to identify Members while they are browsing on the Ulteem Internet site, in order to allow Members to continue browsing without having to re-enter this information for each new page. Members may always prevent the use of cookies by modifying the options of their web browser. To obtain further information about this, please refer to the browser-specific advice on option modification, which is accessible on the "Your Traces" section of the website of the French data protection authority (CNIL): <a href="http://www.cnil.fr" class="lnkSimple" target="_blank">www.cnil.fr</a>.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<a name="ART5-3"></a><h2>3. Who has access to your information?</h2>
					<p class="noMargin">1. The information gathered about you when you register with Ulteem and subscribe to our Services is used to offer you our different Services. All precautions have been taken on our databases to archive your information in a secure environment. Only a small number of our employees have access to your information, which is only accessible in case of necessity. The personal information you provide at the time of registration, which does not comprise your personal ad and your profile, will not be accessible by third parties, nor passed on, sold or exchanged, except in the cases mentioned below and subject to your prior information and agreement, or in assumption of your agreement thereto.</p>
					<p>2. We may send you promotional offers from some of our partners, subject to your explicit and informed consent given during registration, unless you oppose it during your registration or at any moment thereafter. If you do not wish to receive any special offers from Ulteem or our partner companies let us know when you subscribe, or alternatively at any time by clicking on "My Account" on the Ulteem site, or by post.</p>
					<p>3. Ulteem may occasionally share general socio-demographic information that does not include names with selected partners to allow them to target their announcements (by age category, gender, etc.). In this case, we will not send these partners any information that would allow them to identify you.</p>
					<p>4. The results of your Ulteem Test, your personal ads, search criteria and profile can be accessed on the Ulteem website. However, other Ulteem Members may only consult them with your express consent.</p>
					<p>You expressly authorise Ulteem to reproduce and broadcast the results of your Ulteem Test, your personal ad, search criteria and profile (information, description, photos, videos, etc.) in the cases referred to in these Terms of Use on some or all of the Ulteem Service and/or on all methods of electronic communication (e-mail, Internet), worldwide, throughout the duration of these Terms of Use between you and Ulteem. Furthermore, you expressly authorise Ulteem to transfer the benefits of the above-mentioned rights to its partners and any successors of Ulteem.</p>
					<p>If you no longer wish Ulteem or its partners to reproduce or broadcast the results of your Ulteem Test, your personal ad, search criteria and profile, you can terminate your Ulteem account under the conditions provided for in the Article "Termination". Termination will only take effect upon the next update or version of these communication media containing your personal information.</p>
