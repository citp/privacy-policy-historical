                      PERSONS OR PARTIES COVERED<br>

                      <br>
                      This Privacy Policy is intended to cover all visitors to
                      this website, all subscribers to lists or newsletters whether
                      paid or unpaid, all members or affiliates whether paid or
                      unpaid, and all customers. Persons who visit or view this
                      website, whether intentionally or unintentionally, whether
                      solicited or unsolicited, are described herein as "Visitors"
                      and are parties to this Privacy Policy. Subscribers to lists
                      or Newsletters are referred to herein as "Subscribers"
                      and are parties to the Privacy Policy. Persons who join
                      an organization or marketing endeavor (e.g. "affiliates")
                      promoted by this website are called "Members"
                      herein and are covered by this Privacy Policy. Finally,
                      anyone who orders, attempts to order, or receives a product
                      sold (recipients) or advertised on or delivered from this
                      website, even at no cost, is called a "Customer"

                      herein and is subject to this Privacy Policy not only by
                      passive acceptance, but by virtue of the Purchase Agreement
                      contract. The website, its agents, owners, operators, and
                      employees are referred to collectively herein as "Website,"
                      "Site," and/or "Seller".<br>

                      PERSONS EXCLUDED FROM THIS WEBSITE ARE STILL COVERED<br>
                      <br>

                      In the event that a person excluded from this website because
                      of the Terms of Use or from denial of service by the website,
                      who nonetheless unlawfully views this site, that person
                      remains subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and
                      is in violation of the Terms of Use.<br>
                      <br>
                      PERSONS UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS WEBSITE<br>
                      <br>
                      This website is not lawfully accessible to persons under
                      the age of 18 or who are otherwise covered by the provisions
                      of the Child Online Privacy Act of 1998 (COPA). If you are
                      under the age of 18 you must leave this site immediately.
                      Fraudulent use of this website may make you subject to civil
                      or criminal sanctions.<br>
                      <br>
                      VIEWING AND/OR USE AND/OR COMMUNICATION IS CONSTRUED AS
                      ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS OF THIS POLICY<br>

                      <br>
                      Acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy is a portion
                      of the consideration required for your right to visit the
                      website. If you do not accept these terms, you have no right
                      to visit this site and you are fraudulently using this site.<br>
                      <br>
                      A NOTE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS (ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION
                      ACT OF 2003 --OPPA)<br>
                      <br>
                      It is the intent of the Privacy Policy to comply with the
                      California Act. Various provisions throughout this Privacy
                      Policy address requirements of the act. In summary, you
                      must presume that we collect electronic information from
                      all visitors. This is not usually personally identifiable.
                      If you purchase a product or service via this website (and
                      thereby become covered by the Act), the purchase agreement
                      you electronically sign prior to purchase allows the website
                      to collect and archive all the personal information you
                      provide and to transmit and/or transfer that personal information
                      to third parties. There is no way you can modify this information
                      and you have no right to do so. Under the terms of the purchase
                      agreement, you have no right to view or receive any information
                      about our database. In the event that the website, under
                      advice of counsel agrees to divulge information, the requesting
                      party must submit whatever information is demanded by the
                      website in insure that the website is releasing information
                      to the correct party. Other provisions of the OPPA may exempt
                      this website from complying. While we take measures to ensure
                      that outside parties do not have access to any information
                      we have about you, we do not warranty that outside parties
                      will not breach our system and thus have access to your
                      information. (You should know that merchant service providers
                      do not allow us access to your credit card information.)
                      This Privacy Policy also is subject to change without notice.
                      You are required to read it prior to using the website.
                      By interacting with the website you agree to the terms and
                      conditions of the Privacy Policy. By using the website or
                      purchasing a product through this website, you waive the
                      right to use state or federal court systems to address complaints
                      and, instead, agree to use the American Arbitration Association
                      located in a city and county specified herein.<br>
                      <br>

                      ABOUT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION THIS WEBSITE COLLECTS AND
                      HOW IT IS USED<br>
                      This website routinely collects information about its visitors,
                      subscribers, members, and customers. This information is
                      obtained in various ways, such as:<br>
                      <br>
                      VISITOR, SUBSCRIBER, MEMBER, OR CUSTOMER INFORMATION OBTAINED
                      FROM 'REGISTRATION'<br>
                      <br>
                      Registration means that the Visitor, Subscriber, Member
                      or Customer takes active, positive steps to communicate
                      information to this website. This can include pages or 'pop
                      ups' where you register for a newsletter or subscribe to
                      a mailing list; it can include your participation in visitor
                      surveys; it can include requesting information from the
                      website via email, mail, or courier; it may be from joining
                      an affiliate program or other membership organization, paid
                      or unpaid; it may be from ordering a product.<br>
                      <br>

                      Occasionally complete credit card information may be provided
                      to the website via fax or a fill-in form rather than regular
                      secure merchant service processing. This information is
                      kept at the highest level of security and is never divulged
                      to anyone except the merchant service provider or for the
                      purpose of communication with the customer.<br>
                      <br>
                      ONLINE ORDERING<br>
                      <br>
                      Online ordering via SSL encrypted communication provided
                      by shopping cart services supporting merchant service companies
                      like Visa and Master Card provides information to the website
                      but does not provide complete credit card numbers. In the
                      process of online ordering, the customer provides, name,
                      address, city, state, email address, phone number, CVV2
                      (back of card) number, and, occasionally a member password.
                      You should consider all this information available to the
                      website. This information is used to deliver the product,
                      but under the Purchase Agreement you also approve its use
                      for general solicitation purposes.<br>
                      <br>
                      VISITOR EMAIL INQUIRIES<br>

                      <br>
                      Website visitors who wish to communicate with the website
                      do so under two conditions: one, they give their permission
                      for contact by the website; two, they are subject to any
                      ‘submission’ provisions of the Terms of Use,
                      Purchase Agreement, or this Privacy Policy. While your email
                      address may or may not be used to solicit you, it is added
                      to the website's general solicitation database.<br>
                      <br>
                      CUSTOMER EMAIL OR TESTIMONIALS<br>
                      <br>
                      If you are a customer and send an email to the website,
                      or if you communicate with the site by phone or mail, the
                      website collects information about your communication and
                      by communicating with the site you give your permission
                      to collect, archive, retrieve, and otherwise use any information
                      collected as the site sees fit.<br>

                      <br>
                      Any communication which, in its sole discretion, the site
                      deems to be a testimonial, may be publicized for commercial
                      purposes.<br>
                      <br>
                      INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM VISITOR INTERACTION WITH BANNERS,
                      POPUPS, OR SITE ADVERTISERS<br>
                      <br>
                      Visitors clicking on banners or pop-ups or hyperlinked advertising,
                      appearing on this website must assume that information is
                      being collected about them. This site is not responsible
                      for the use of information collected in such a fashion.
                      Visitors must assume that (1) information will be collected,
                      (2) that ‘cookies’ will usually be placed on
                      their hard drive, (3) that website does not have any control
                      over what happens with this information, (4) that website
                      takes no responsibility over the accuracy or content of
                      advertisers, (5) that website is not responsible for downloads
                      from third party advertisers that contain viruses or worms
                      or other computer code that causes their computer or software
                      harm, and (6) that website assumes no responsibility for
                      the data that is garnered from the click itself or that
                      the advertiser collects.<br>

                      <br>
                      INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM REFERRING EMAIL OR REFERRING URLS<br>
                      If you send a friend an email from this site or if you send
                      the url or one of our web pages to a friend, you must assume
                      that some data is collected about your IP address or your
                      email address and that of your friend. You must assume that
                      referred emails or web pages may appear to come from your
                      email. You must accept fully responsibility for referring
                      pages or email to a friend and agree to indemnify this site
                      for any damage, intentional or unintentional that results
                      from said referrals.<br>
                      <br>
                      INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM VOLUNTARY VISITOR, SUBSCRIBER,
                      MEMBER OR CUSTOMER SURVEYS<br>
                      <br>
                      Unless otherwise specified in the survey, you must assume
                      that any information provided to the website as part of
                      a survey in which you participate may be used for general
                      solicitation for commercial purposes and that such information
                      will be shared with joint venture partners, affiliates,
                      marketing organization or used by the site itself for product
                      design or solicitation purposes.<br>

                      <br>
                      INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM ELECTRONIC MEANS AND 'COOKIES'<br>
                      <br>
                      Many websites, including this one, collect information about
                      your computer, your email address, your IP address. You
                      must assume that your web-viewing or web-use activity is
                      monitored, tracked, and information collected. This information
                      is not usually of a personal nature, but it may help define
                      your viewing habits and product preferences even though
                      the website may or may not have any idea who you are.<br>
                      <br>
                      "Cookies" is web jargon for bits of computer code
                      placed on your hard drive. Websites use this to keep you
                      'logged in', to keep track of search criteria, to monitor
                      use, to password protect use of the site or use of products
                      sold by the site. Cookies can also be used to obtain information
                      about your computer configuration or your use of your computer.<br>

                      <br>
                      Cookies can be used to electronically gather information
                      about you. Again, it may or may not be personal information,
                      but it is information and by using this site you are expressly
                      giving permission to use 'cookies' and to use the information
                      gathered from their use to benefit you. You also give permission
                      to collect, archive, retrieve, and use any information collected
                      for product design, product offers to you, and general commercial
                      solicitation purposes by this site or joint venture partners,
                      affiliates, and marketing organizations.<br>
                      <br>
                      HOW INFORMATION MAY BE USED<br>
                      <br>
                      The use of information as described below may or may not
                      be how information that is collected is customarily used
                      by this site. While actual use of any information collected
                      may be used quite conservatively, you must assume that it
