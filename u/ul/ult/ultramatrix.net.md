**IP address:** Every computer connected to the Internet has a numeric address called an "IP address." This may or may not correspond uniquely to a particular computer. 

**Browser type** : A user's browser is a software program running on a computer that allows users to access documents on the World Wide Web. Browsers can be either text or graphic. They read HTML coded pages that reside on a server and interpret the coding into what the user sees as Web pages. Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer are examples of Web browsers. Browser type typically discloses hardware platform, operating system, and browser software and version. 

**Referrer:** The referrer is the URL of the Internet resource or page that causes a browser to request a page or image from Z-Host servers.
