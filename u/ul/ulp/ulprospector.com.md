# Prospector Privacy Statement

Your privacy is important to us. Please take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with our Privacy Policy. YOUR USE OF THE SITE CONSTITUTES ACCEPTANCE OF THE PROSPECTER WEBSITE PRIVACY POLICY. 

#### Information we collect

We may collect the following types of information: 

  * **Information you provide** \- When you sign up for UL's PROSPECTOR® materials database and information website (" **Site** "), we ask you for certain professional information. The only professionally identifiable information that we keep is the information that you provide to us. You may provide the following information for each of our services: 
    * **Prospector Database** : When you register to use the Prospector database you must provide professional information such as your name, company name, title, e-mail address, address, and certain demographic information. Please review Terms of Use for further information on use and privacy. 
  * **Cookies** \- A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer that is tied to information about the user. When you visit the Site, we send one or more cookies to your computer or other browsing device. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service, including for storing user preferences, improving search results and ad selection, and tracking user trends. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. More information about cookies. 
  * **Log information** \- We also collect data in a form that does not permit direct association with any specific individual. When you access the Site via a browser, application or other client our servers automatically record certain information. This may include information such as your web request, your interaction with a service, Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your account. To the extent that IP addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we treat these identifiers as professional information. Similarly, to the extent that non-professional information is combined with professional information, we treat the combined information as professional information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy. 
  * **Product Ordering** \- We request information from the user on our order form. A user must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user. Our online order center is a secure site to protect your personally identifiable and financial information. To learn more about our security, please review the information provided below under the section titled "How we protect your professional information". 



#### How we use this information

  * The information we collect allows us to keep you posted on our latest announcements and upcoming events. It also helps us to improve our services, content, and communications. If you don't want to be on our mailing list, you can opt out anytime by updating your preferences. 
  * We also use information we collect to help us develop, deliver, and improve our services, content, and communications. 
  * We may use your information to send important notices or communications regarding services you have ordered from UL. We may also use information we collect for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve our products, services, and customer communications. 
  * We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-professional information for any purpose.
  * **Prospector Database** : The information you provide to UL to use the Prospector database is collected and used so that, from time to time, we can send you information on programs and services that we believe may be of interest to you. If you don't want to be on our mailing list, you can opt out anytime by updating your preferences. We reserve the right to disclose information about your usage and demographics, provided that it will not reveal your professional identity in connection with the disclosure of such information. 



#### How we protect your professional information

We do not collect professionally identifiable information without your permission. You can choose which, if any, of our online resources you wish to participate in. 

With respect to the Prospector database, UL only shares professional information with other companies or individuals outside of UL in the following limited circumstances: 

  * We provide such information to our affiliated companies, other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing professional information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. 
  * We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Use, including investigation of potential violations, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety as required or permitted by law. 



UL understands the importance of security and takes precautions to protect our users' information. 

When our member registration and order forms asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card numbers), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon in Web browsers address bars becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just 'surfing.' 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also take steps to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our accounts receivable department or customer service representatives) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to user information. Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users' information is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, within a locked facility. 

If users have any questions about the security at our Site, users can send an email to: [customer.support@ULProspector.com](mailto:customer.support@ulprospector.com)

#### Links to Third Party Websites

This Privacy Policy applies to Prospector database services only. We do not exercise control over third party websites, nor do links to these websites imply that UL is affiliated with the linked site. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit professional information from you. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those third parties. 

#### Accessing your information

For many of our services, we provide mechanisms for you to update your professional information. You may access and update your professional information by logging into your Prospector database account. You are responsible for updating your professional information. 

#### Changes to this Privacy Policy

UL reserves the right to modify, amend, or update, this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason without notice to you. Any such modifications, amendments, updates or deletions will be effective immediately upon posting. Your continued use of the Site after such posting shall be deemed to constitute acceptance by you of the changes.
