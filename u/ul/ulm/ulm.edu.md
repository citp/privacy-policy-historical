# Statements & Policies | ULM University of Louisiana at Monroe

**Commitment To Privacy**

University of Louisiana Monroe (ULM) University (University of Louisiana Monroe (ULM) or “University”) is committed to maintaining the privacy and security of any collected confidential or highly sensitive personal information. This policy has been adopted to address the collection, use, and dissemination of personal information by the University. This policy is subject to change over time, as the technologies utilized to provide services via the Internet continue to develop and evolve. Despite changes in technology, any alterations to this policy will not affect the University’s commitment to privacy. 

**General Statement**

This policy applies to all information digitally collected by or submitted to University of Louisiana Monroe (ULM). University of Louisiana Monroe (ULM) receives information via two primary methods: 

  * Information collected automatically via websites
  * Information voluntarily provided by the user in order to receive information and/or services (via web forms and email). 



**Information Collection**

**3.1 Automatic Collection**

If a user has not taken specific steps to anonymize their personal web traffic (e.g. apply mechanisms such as the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on that disable the collection of data for analytical purposes), official University websites may collect certain information automatically. This information includes, but is not limited to: 

  * User’s Internet protocol (IP) address
  * Internet service provider
  * Operating system
  * The time and date of the visit
  * Browser
  * The site from which the user visited
  * Cookie information (if applicable)



Any information collected automatically is not associated with any other information held by University of Louisiana Monroe (ULM) (i.e. not linked with information voluntarily provided to University of Louisiana Monroe (ULM)) unless University of Louisiana Monroe (ULM) is required to do so by law. 

**3.2 Voluntary Submission**

In order to provide information and/or services, University of Louisiana Monroe (ULM) may request users to provide personal data, some of which may be personally identifiable information. Information such as name, date of birth, email address, etc. can be collected via voluntary submission of an email or web form to a University of Louisiana Monroe (ULM) entity. 

**Information Use**

Website information that is gathered automatically is utilized to improve the understanding of how University-provided websites are being leveraged by the user community. For example, some University websites use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. Google Analytics uses “cookies” (i.e. files used to track website activity) to determine how users navigate University sites. Google uses this cookie data for various purposes, including the evaluation of website use, reports on website activity, and other services. Please visit the following pages for more information on Google Analytics’ terms of use and Google’s privacy practices. 

Any information submitted to University of Louisiana Monroe (ULM) voluntarily in order to receive services and/or information will only be utilized to conduct official university business. University of Louisiana Monroe (ULM) may disseminate voluntarily submitted information to third parties and offices/departments within the University to the extent necessary in order to provide the requested services and/or information. University of Louisiana Monroe (ULM) may also disseminate such information if required by applicable international, federal, state and/or local laws. 

University of Louisiana Monroe (ULM) will not disclose any information submitted voluntarily for reasons other than mentioned above, without clear notice and the opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such uses. University of Louisiana Monroe (ULM) will never sell or trade voluntarily submitted information to other entities unless a prior consent has been obtained and/or such information is being shared in response to a subpoena, court order, or legal process. 

There is no legal requirement for a user to provide any information to the University. However, without certain information, University websites and services may not function as intended and features may be inaccessible. 

**Use Of Cookies**

Some University of Louisiana Monroe (ULM) websites use cookies (beyond cookies utilized by Google Analytics), which enable University of Louisiana Monroe (ULM) to further tailor its web services to the needs of the user community. Cookie data assists the University in improving both web content and distribution. Users have the right to refuse the use of cookies by implementing technical configurations in their web browsers; however, functionalities of certain sites may be impacted if such configurations are implemented. 

**External Links**

Some University sites may contain links to external websites not owned by, or officially affiliated with, University of Louisiana Monroe (ULM) in any way. If a user decides to navigate to external links, he/she will leave the University website and thus, the University is not responsible for privacy practices or the content of such websites. Navigating to external links is done at the user’s own risk and users should be aware that University of Louisiana Monroe (ULM)’s policies no longer apply. University of Louisiana Monroe (ULM) recommends that users review the privacy policy and applicable terms of all sites they visit. 

**Data Security**

In addition to complying with all applicable laws and regulations, the University strives to implement and maintain systems and policies to protect the confidentiality and integrity of personal information provided by users. Despite these security measures, the University does not represent or warrant that personal information will be protected against loss, misuse or alteration by third parties.  Any information transmitted to University of Louisiana Monroe (ULM) by the user is done so at the user’s own risk. Once the information is received by University of Louisiana Monroe (ULM), the University will make every effort to ensure the security of data on University of Louisiana Monroe (ULM)’s systems.
