# Privacy - Ulule

Because Ulule is a French company, the Data is collected and maintained in France. For your information, this processing has been reported to the relevant local authority (Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés), under the number 1427763.

Let's keep it simple : we work for you. To offer you the best service possible, to make it easy for you to organize a fundraising, to share it with your networks, to promote, to manage your project and your supports.

We **do not** work to collect every data we can about you, to know your social status and you sexual preferences, to save all your friends' birthdays et send it all to advertising agencies searching for stories to tell to their clients.

When you create your Ulule account, we save only the datas you want to give us - and they rarely go further than your e-mail or website address. **You keep a total control over these datas** , you can edit or delete them anytime you want.

A word about Facebook, which gathers (often with good reasons) a lot of complaints about its privacy policy : we use Facebook Connect to ease the process for the users who'd rather login with their usual ID. **We don't collect any data from your Facebook account** other than your name and your profil picture. The other way, **we don't transmit any data to Facebook** , except the ones that you'd specifically authorized (notifications on your wall for example).

As every website, we're using our own utilization stats to improve the service. We use Google Analytics to collect these datas, which once again aren't nominatives. But if you don't wish to communicate this type of information, **you can ask for an opt-out from Google Analytics**.

The only nominatives infos that we transfer to a third party, punctually and if you allow it, are your Ulule coordinates to the project owner you did support, so he can receive his funds et send you (if there's one) your reward.

This is our commitment. We're a stickler for your privacy. Would you have a question, an inquiry, something on your mind, don't hesitate to mail us at : [privacy@ulule.com](mailto:privacy@ulule.com).

Then, if you'd rather use good old fashionned paper mail, you can write us here : Ulule, Privacy Service, 24 rue de l'Est, 75020 Paris. We'll answer you briefly.
