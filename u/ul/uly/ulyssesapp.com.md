## Introduction

At Ulysses, we respect your privacy. We believe that the less we know about you, the better; that is why we aim to limit the information we collect to the minimum necessary. The purpose of this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) is to inform you in detail what personally identifiable information or personal information we collect from you when you use our website, how we use such information, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to review and correct, the information.

We reserve the right to change this policy, which we will do through online posting. We use your data solely to provide you with services in which you enroll.

For purposes of this Privacy Policy, the terms “Ulysses”, “we,” “us” and “our” refer to the company Ulysses GmbH & Co. KG; the term “website” refer to the Ulysses website and related services; and “you” refers to you, as a user of the website as applicable.

## Who We Are

Ulysses GmbH & Co. KG is a German company located in Brockhausstraße 88, 04229 Leipzig. We comply with the European law for Data Protection (“GDPR”).

## What Information We Collect and How We Use It

We collect solely information that is necessary to provide you with our services and to improve our website. We do not share these data with third party services (e.g., Google or Facebook) for the purpose of advertising.

**Styles & Themes Account Information.** To allow the users of our app to exchange Ulysses styles and themes, we offer a website called Styles & Themes. If you want to upload a style or a theme on this website, you need to create an account. To manage your Styles & Themes account, we store the email address or social media handle you used for sign-in, as well as associated credentials like passwords or authentication tokens. – Legal basis Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR

**Website Analytics (Optional).** To improve our website, we use the web analytics software Matomo to collect pseudonymized data about the time of your visit, the pages you visit, as well as the device and browser you are using. – Legal basis Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR

**Email Newsletter Subscription (Optional).** To inform you about new features, releases and blog posts, we offer a newsletter for which you can subscribe with your email address.

We use Campaign Monitor to manage our newsletter and other email lists. Campaign Monitor provides us with data concerning your email activity, that is, the place, date and time where and when you open our messages, the device type you are using, and your interactions with our messages such as clicking a link.

You can unsubscribe from our newsletter by clicking on the unsubscribe link provided at the end of the newsletter. If you don’t want us to track your email activity, you can click the preferences link at the end of the newsletter. It will take you to your newsletter preferences, where you can opt out from email activity tracking. You can also email [help@ulysses.app](mailto:help@ulysses.app) to update or unsubscribe your email address, to request that we delete your email address, or that we stop tracking your email activity. – Legal basis Art. 6(1)(a+f) GDPR

**Cookies.** We use cookies for the following purposes:

  * **Website Analytics** to identify you as a visitor.
  * **Website Analytics Consent** to store your consent regarding the analytics tracking.
  * **Styles & Themes Authentication** to check your login status.



## Where We Store Your Data

**Style & Themes Content and Account information.** Your Styles & Themes content is stored on our servers hosted by Hetzner and can be viewed and downloaded on the Styles & Themes website. If you would like to delete your account you can go to your profile settings and press the „Delete Account“ button.

**Website Analytics (Optional).** The usage data and device information are stored with a pseudonymized cookie ID on our own servers hosted by Melting Mind. If you want us to delete all tracked data, please send a message to [help@ulysses.app](mailto:help@ulysses.app).

**Customer Support Emails.** For customer support and email services, we use Front as our help desk software. This means that every email you send to us will be stored at Front. Additionally, we are legally required to archive all email traffic for ten years. This is done by our server hosting company Melting Mind. We do not have direct access to the created backups.

## How Long We Store Your Data For

We store your data for as long as German law requires, or as is necessary for the fulfillment or the initiation of a contract, or as long as we claim legitimate interests. After the expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted or completely anonymized. We have detailed some of the deletion periods under “Where We Store Your Data”. Statistical and diagnostic data is generally never deleted.

We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g., tax regulations) or can result from contractual provisions (e.g., information on the contractual partner).
