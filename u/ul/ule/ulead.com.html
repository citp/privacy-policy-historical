                            form with information such as name, e-mail address 
                            and product serial number. This data is used to provide 
                            information about the services on our site for which 
                            the user has expressed an interest. It is optional 
                            for the user to give demographic information (such 
                            as gender, address or occupation), but encouraged, 
                            so that we can provide a more tailored experience 
                            on our site. To confirm registration, we send all

                            chooses, may be used for future promotional offers. 
                            If we have trouble processing an order, this contact 
                            information will be used to get in touch with the

                            This Web site takes every precaution to protect our 
                            users' information. When users submit sensitive information 
                            via the Web site, your information is protected both 
                            online and off-line.</p>
                          <p class="bodytext">When our registration/order form 
                            asks users to enter sensitive information (such as 
                            credit card number and/or social security number), 
                            that information is protected with the best encryption 
                            software in the industry: Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). 
                            While on a secure page, such as our order form, the 
                            lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape® 
                            Navigator and Microsoft® Internet Explorer becomes 
                            locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when you 
                            are just 'surfing'. To learn more about SSL, follow 
                            this link <a href="http://www.verisign.com/site/ssl.html">http://www.verisign.com/site/ssl.html

                          <p class="bodytext">At Ulead, we also do everything 
                            in our power to protect user information off-line. 
                            All of our users' information remains confidential 
                            in our offices. Only a selected number of employees 
                            who need the information to perform a specific job 
                            (e.g. a customer service representative) are granted 
                            access to personally identifiable information. These 
                            employees must also use password-protected screen-savers 
                            when they leave their desk. Furthermore, ALL employees 
                            are kept up to date on our security and privacy practices. 
                            Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are 
                            added, our employees are notified and/or reminded 
                            about the importance we place on privacy and what 
                            they can do to ensure our customers' information is 
                            protected. Finally, the servers on which we store 
                            personally identifiable information are kept in a 
                            secure environment, behind locked doors.</p>
                          <p class="bodytext">If you have any questions about 
                            the security at our Web site, you can send an e-mail 
                            to <a href="mailto:privacy@ulead.com">privacy@ulead.com.

                            Due to their request, established members will occasionally 
                            receive information about products, services, special 
                            deals, and a News Flash. Out of respect for the privacy 
                            of our users, we provide the option to discontinue 
                            these types of communications. For more details, please 
                            see the Choice/Opt-out paragraph below.</p>

                            Personal Information</span><br>
                            If a user's personally identifiable information changes 
                            (such as the postal code) or if a user no longer desires 
                            our service, we provide a way to correct, update or 
                            remove that user's personal data. This is done at 
                            the member information page.</p>
                          <p class="bodytext"><span class="subhead">Choice/Opt-out</span><br>
                            Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of 
                            having their information used for purposes not directly 
                            related to our site at the point where we ask for 
                            the information. These types of options may include 
                            receiving product specific news, 3rd party contact, 
                            or even adding your e-mail address to a contest list. 
                            For example, our order form has an opt-in/opt-out 
                            check box, so users who prefer not to receive any 
                            marketing material or product updates can keep their 
                            e-mail address off of our lists.</p>
                          <p class="bodytext">Users who no longer wish to receive 
                            our newsletter or promotional materials from our partners 
                            may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying 
                            to unsubscribe in the subject line in the e-mail or

                            If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will 
                            post those changes on our home page so our users are 
                            always aware of what information we collect, how we 
                            use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose
