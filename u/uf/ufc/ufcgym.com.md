## INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU AND HOW WE COLLECT IT

We may collect several types of information from and about users of our Website and our clubs, which may include:

  * Information you provide by filling out forms on our Website. This includes information provided at the time of registering to use our Website, subscribing to our services, posting material or public comments, or requesting further services, and includes information by which you may be personally identified, such as name, home and/or postal address, e-mail address, telephone number, gender, date of birth, user ID, password, and/or UFC Gym membership number. This information is personally identifiable information (“PII”) and it allows us to contact you and distinguish you from other users, among other things.

  * You may also provide information when you carry out transactions through our Website. For example, if you buy products and/or services through our Website we gather information such as what you are purchasing, your method of payment, and your billing and shipping information. We will use this information to complete the transaction, to provide you with an order history and to facilitate future orders. This information may also be used for aggregate reporting (which summarizes the data in a report but does not contain your PII).

  * Device and application data: we collect data about the devices and applications used when connecting to/or accessing our Website, including but not limited to, IP address and browser type. We can usually infer geographic data based on a subscriber’s IP address. If you visit our Sites from an external source (like another website or via email link), we might record information about the source that referred you to us.

  * Information from cookies and web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs): we use third party tracking services such as Google Analytics that use cookies and web beacons to collect aggregated and anonymized data about visitors to our Sites. This data may include usage and subscriber statistics. **Detailed collected information can be such as audience location, audience engagement, mobile traffic behavior, traffic sources, social media traffic, site content trends, page bounce rates, site search behavior, events and funnel visualization.**

  * In-club beacons: in addition to web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs), we may also have beacons present in a UFC GYM Club which may be used to check you in to the Club, confirm your attendance to classes and monitor your use of equipment in the UFC GYM Club.



  * We may collect certain fitness information about you through the UFC GYM Mobile Application, through heart rate monitors and other wearable technologies (e.g., Apple Watch, FitBit, Garmin, etc.) including, without limitation, your birth date, heart rate, step count and information about your heart rate and performance in classes as well as on machines used in the Club (e.g. bikes, ellipticals, and treadmills) which collect such data. Additionally, we may collect information from other applications on your mobile device such as the Health app.

  * Certain areas of our Website, including our social media accounts, contain information supplied by users and others. If you submit user content to our social media accounts, you acknowledge that the content will be publicly available. Please do not submit any information to the social media accounts, including personally identifiable information, that you do not want to make public. We are not responsible for comments, advice, reviews, information, or any other posting made by you, other users or third parties in these areas. We do not have the obligation, but we reserve the right, to review content posted in public areas, including to our social media pages, and to delete or edit them, for any reason, at any time.

  * We may provide fitness tracking tools through a third party service provider which allow you to save your fitness information so that you can track your workouts, nutrition or other private information about yourself. Such third parties may store your fitness tracking information in order to provide you with these tools. Such third parties may provide such information to us and also use that information to provide you with other services through our Website. Once we separate your fitness tracking information from your PII, so that it cannot be linked back to you, we may use the aggregated information for other purposes.

  * We may also ask you for information when you enter and/or participate in certain sweepstakes and contests sponsored by us. If you enter a contest, we record your entry and link it to your registration information. Your PII may be used to contact you for winner notification, prize delivery and related purposes.

  * We may receive additional PII from you through communications with the Site. For example, if you email the Site to ask about a product or service, we will use that information to respond to your inquiry, to have a history of our service to you and to make better our service by reporting your request, without any PII, in our customer service totals.

  * Information you provide to us in order to use our UFC GYM Clubs including, without limitation, information provided in connection with the purchase and/or use of a UFC GYM membership, personal training session or other products and services sold by UFC GYM. Information provided to us in connection with UFC GYM memberships, personal training sessions and/or other services provide at UFC GYM Clubs will be shared with and stored by third party data processors that we work with (at this time, ClubReady) including, without limitation, your fingerprint.
