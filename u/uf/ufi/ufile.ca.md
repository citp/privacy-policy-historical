**FULL PRIVACY STATEMENT**

WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES DT TAX COLLECT AND HOW DO WE USE IT? 

DT Tax collects information about our users in three ways: directly from the user, from our web server logs, and through cookies. DT Tax uses the information primarily to provide you with a personalized Internet experience that delivers the information, resources, and services that are most relevant and helpful to you.  DT Tax doesn’t share any of the information you provide with others, unless expressly provided in this Privacy Statement, or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.

User-Supplied Information 

When you register for DT Tax services or order products via our site, we ask you to provide some personal information, for example, your name, address, phone number, email address, payment card information, and/or certain additional categories of information resulting from use of our websites and services, such as research requests. DT Tax keeps this information in a contact database for future reference, as needed.  DT Tax may use certain information you provide to offer you products and services that we believe may be of interest to you.  If you do not wish to receive such offers, you may opt out (unsubscribe). 

If you contact DT Tax for customer support, we may ask you to provide information about your computer or about the issues you are trying to resolve. This information is necessary to help us answer your questions.  We may record your requests and our responses for quality control purposes.

Some Thomson Reuters websites make chat rooms, forums, message boards, or news groups available to you.  Please remember that any information disclosed in these areas is public.  You should exercise caution when disclosing personal information in these areas.  Do not  disclose information in these public forums that might be considered confidential.

Cookies 

In order to offer and provide a customized and personal service, DT Tax may use cookies to store and help track information about you.  Cookies are simply small pieces of data that are sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. DT Tax uses cookies to help remind us who you are and to help you navigate our sites during your visits. Cookies allow us to save passwords and preferences for you so you won't have to re-enter them each time you visit. 

The use of cookies is relatively standard.  Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. However, if you prefer, you can set your browser to either notify you when you receive a cookie or to refuse to accept cookies. You should understand that some features of many sites may not function properly if you don't accept cookies.

**Third Party Services** ****

DT Tax may use services hosted by third parties to assist in providing our services and to help us understand our customers' use of our products.  These services may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, including your IP address or cookies. If these third party services collect information, they do so anonymously and in the aggregate to provide information helpful to us such as website trends, without identifying individual visitors.  Please see "Cookies" in the section above for information on how you can control the use of cookies on your computer.

HOW DOES DT TAX PROTECT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT IT COLLECTS?

DT Tax has implemented certain appropriate security measures to help protect your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.  For example, some of our websites are protected with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. Furthermore, we store the information about you in a data center with restricted access and appropriate monitoring, and we use a variety of technical security measures to secure your data. In addition, we use intrusion detection and virus protection software. **However, please note that we cannot guarantee that unauthorized persons will always be unable to defeat our security measures**.

In addition, please note that DT Tax may store and process your personal information in systems located outside of your home country, including the United States.  However, regardless of where storage and processing may occur, we take appropriate steps to ensure that your information is protected, consistent with the principles set forth under this statement.

WHO HAS ACCESS TO THE PERSONAL INFORMATION?

DT Tax will not sell, rent, or lease mailing lists or other customer data to others, and we will not make your personal information available to any unaffiliated parties, except as follows:

  * To agents and/or contractors who may use it on our behalf or in connection with their relationship with us (for example, we may use third parties to help us with promotional campaigns). 
  * As required by law, in a matter of public safety or policy, as needed in connection with the transfer of our business assets (for example, if we are acquired by another company or if we are liquidated during bankruptcy proceedings), or if we believe in good faith that sharing the data is necessary to protect our rights or property. 



DT Tax also relies on some of our affiliates for support of the products and services we offer, and we share some of our back-office functions with other Thomson Reuters companies.  Our affiliates are all required to preserve the confidentiality of any personal information they may access. 

DT Tax will not disclose any information about your usage to unaffiliated third parties, except as necessary to service the account, to enforce the terms of use, to meet our obligations to content and technology providers, or as required by law. 

DT Tax may also use statistics regarding usage for product development purposes, but we only use those statistics in the aggregate and they don't include any personally identifiable information about individual users.

Your access to some of DT Tax services and content may be password-protected. We recommend that you refrain from disclosing your username(s) and password(s) to anyone.  We also recommend that you sign out of your account or service at the end of each session. Moreover, you may wish to close your browser window when you have finished your work, especially if you share a computer with someone else or if you are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe.

HOW MAY I CORRECT, AMEND, OR DELETE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION AND/OR UPDATE MY PREFERENCES?
