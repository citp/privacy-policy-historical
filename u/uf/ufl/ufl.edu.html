        <h2>Web Privacy Statement</h2>
	
      <h3>A Note to Children and Parents</h3>
	  <p>The University of Florida websites are operated by the University of Florida and affiliated entities (see definitions below).  The web sites are
	  intended for use by adults, unless they are specifically labeled for children.</p>
	  <p>Children - Some internet sites may ask you to share information about yourself.  Before sending any information about yourself over the Internet
	  to us or anyone else, be sure to ask your parents for permission.</p>
	  <p>Parents - the University of Florida recommends that parents take an active role in their children's use of the Internet.  We encourage you to talk
	  to your children about safe and responsible use of their personal information while using the Internet.</p>
	  
	  <h3>Commitment to Privacy</h3>
	  <p>The University of Florida values individuals' privacy and actively seeks to preserve the privacy rights of those who share information with us.
	  Your trust is important to us and we believe you have the right to know how information submitted through a university Web site is handled.</p>
	  <p>We provide the following privacy notice to define UF's web-based information policies and practices, and to assist you in protecting your privacy.</p>
	  
	  <h3>Privacy Notice</h3>
	  <p>The following information explains the Internet privacy policy and practices the University has adopted for its official Web sites.  However, in legal
	  terms, it shall not be construed as a contractual promise, and the University reserves the right to amend it at any time without notice. Privacy and
	  public records obligations of the University are governed by applicable Florida statutes and U.S. federal laws.</p>
	  
	  <h3>Site Definitions</h3>
	  <p>University Web space includes hundreds of sites with varying levels of University involvement and commitment as outlined below.</p>
	  <h4>Official University Web Sites</h4>
	  <p>Except as noted, the information in this privacy notice applies to all official University of Florida Web sites, which are defined as the Web pages of
	  university colleges, schools, departments, divisions or other units and any other sites specifically designated as official by a vice president, dean,
	  department head or director. Official pages are generally recognizable by a standard page header and/or footer carrying the University logo, contact
	  information and reference to this privacy statement.</p>
	  <h4>Unofficial Web Sites</h4>
	  <p>Within the University of Florida domain - signified by the address "ufl.edu" or within the range of Internet protocol addresses assigned to the University
	  of Florida - you may find Web sites over which the University has no editorial responsibility or control. Such sites are considered unofficial and include,
	  but are not limited to, the Web pages of individual faculty members or students and the Web pages of student organizations and other entities not formally
	  a part of the University. While UF encourages compliance with this Web Privacy Statement at such sites, in order to better understand the policies and
	  practices under which they operate, please consult the privacy statements of individual sites or seek information directly from the persons responsible
	  for those sites.</p>
	  
	  <p>The Web Privacy Statement speaks generally to the information collected by or submitted to official University of Florida Web sites. Still the amount
	  and type of information collected may vary somewhat from site to site. Therefore, in addition to this general explanation of policy and practice,
	  the University encourages colleges, schools, departments, divisions and other units contributing to its official Web pages to post, as necessary, more
	  specific approved privacy notices pertaining to the collection and use of any personal information associated exclusively with those pages. Thus it is
	  wise for users to read page-specific notices to better understand the privacy policies and practices applicable to a particular site.</p>
	  
	  <h3>The Information We Collect</h3>
	  <p>When you access official UF Web pages, certain client information and essential and nonessential technical information (collectively referred to as access
	  information) listed below is automatically collected. No other information is collected through our official Web sites except when you deliberately send
	  it to us (for example, by clicking a link to send us an e-mail). Examples of the information you might choose to send us are listed below as "optional
	  information."</p>
	  
	  <h4>Access Information (automatically collected)</h4>
	  <p>Client information: the Internet domain and Internet address of the computer you are using.</p>
	  <p>Essential technical information: identification of the page or service you are requesting, type of browser and operating system you are using; and the date
	  and time of access.</p>
	  <p>Nonessential technical information: the Internet address of the Web site from which you linked directly to our Web site, and the "cookie information"
	  used to direct and tailor information based on your entry path to the site. </p>
	  
	  <h4>Optional information (deliberately sent)</h4>
	  <p>E-mail: your name, e-mail address, and the content of your e-mail.</p>
	  <p>Online forms:  all the data you choose to fill in or confirm. This may include credit or debit card information if you are ordering a product or making a payment,
	  as well as information about other people if you are providing it for delivery purposes, etc.</p>
	  
	  <h3>The Way We Use Information</h3>
	  <p>As a general rule, UF does not track individual visitor profiles. We do, however, analyze aggregate traffic/access information for resource management and site
	  planning purposes. UF reserves the right to use log detail to investigate resource management or security concerns.</p>
	  <h4>Access Information</h4>
	  <p>Client information is used to route the requested Web page to your computer for viewing. In theory, the requested Web page and the routing information
	  could be discerned by other entities involved in transmitting the requested page to you. We do not control the privacy practices of those entities.</p>
	  <p>We may keep client information from our systems indefinitely after the Web page is transmitted, but we do not cross-reference it to the individuals who browse
	  our Web site. However, on rare occasions when a "hacker" attempts to breach computer security, logs of access information are retained to permit a security
	  investigation. In such cases the logs may be further analyzed or forwarded together with any other relevant information in our possession to law enforcement agencies.</p>
	  <p>Under the Florida Public Records Laws, certain records in our possession are subject to inspection by or disclosure to members of the public. As indicated above,
	  client information retained after transmission of the requested Web page will be available for inspection.</p>
	  <p>Essential and nonessential technical information lets us respond to your request in an appropriate format [or in a personalized manner] and helps us plan Web site
	  improvements. To expedite this process, some official University of Florida Web sites use "cookies." Usually a cookie enables the university Web site to tailor what
	  you see according to the way you entered the site (i.e., if you entered by pushing a button identifying yourself as a student, your subsequent views of information
	  might be tailored for student audiences).</p>
	  <p>We also use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our Web site. For example, we may determine that X number of individuals visited a certain
	  area on our Web site, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out a particular registration form. But we do not disclose information that could identify
	  those specific individuals.</p>
	  
	  <h4>Optional Information:</h4>
	  <p>Optional information enables us to provide services or information tailored more specifically to your needs, to forward your message or inquiry to another
	  entity that is better able to do so, and to plan Web site improvements.</p>
	  <p>We use the information you provide about yourself or about someone else when placing a request for service only to complete that order or request. We do not share
	  this information with outside parties, except to the extent necessary to complete that order or request.</p>
	  <p>We generally use return e-mail addresses only to answer the e-mail we receive. Such addresses are generally not used for any other purpose and by university
	  and state policy are not shared with outside parties.</p>
	  <p>Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the purpose described without a clear notice on
	  the particular site and without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.</p>
	  
	  <h3>Providing Information is Your Choice</h3>
	  <p>There is no legal requirement for you to provide any information at our Web site. However, our Web site will not work without routing information and the essential
	  technical information. Failure of your browser to provide nonessential technical information will not prevent your use of our Web site but may prevent certain features
	  from working. For any optional information that is requested at the Web site, failure to provide the requested information will mean that the particular feature or
	  service associated with that part of the Web page may not be available to you.</p>
	  
	  <p>Special Note: <a href="http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=Ch0668/SEC6076.HTM&amp;Title=-%3e2007-%3eCh0668-%3eSection%206076#0668.6076">S668.6076, F.S.</a> requires the University of Florida to post the following notice:</p>
	  <p>Under Florida law, email addresses are public records. If you do not want your email address released in response to a public records request, 
	  do not send electronic mail to the University. Instead, contact the specific office or individual by phone or in writing.</p>
	  <h3>Our Commitment To Data Security</h3>
	  <p>The University of Florida is dedicated to preventing unauthorized data access, maintaining data accuracy, and ensuring the appropriate use of information. We strive
	  to put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial safeguards to secure the information we collect online. These security practices are consistent with the
	  policies of the university and with the laws and regulatory practices of the State of Florida.</p>
	  
	  <h3>How To Contact Us</h3>
	  <p>Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies and practices, please call us at (352) 273-5094 or (866) 876-4472 (toll-free), or send us an
	  e-mail at <a href="mailto:privacy@ufl.edu">privacy@ufl.edu</a>.</p>
	  <p>If you wish to review or change information gathered about you via an official University of Florida web site but you do not know how, the Privacy Office will assist
	  in locating the persons responsible for that site so that you may make your request directly to them.</p>
