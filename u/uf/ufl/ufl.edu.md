Internet Privacy Policy:

Thank you for visiting the University of Florida.

If you choose to share personal information with us, we will not sell that information to commercial entities. Some information must be saved for a designated period of time to comply with Florida's records retention policies and may be released if required by the Florida's Public Records Law. Most student information is kept confidential pursuant to the federal and state Buckley Amendments. 

If you have questions about our privacy policy, or have ideas about improving our policy, please feel free to e-mail us at webadmin@aa.ufl.edu. Or you can reach us by telephone at (352) 392-3753.
