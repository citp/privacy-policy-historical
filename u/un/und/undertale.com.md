# Privacy Policy - Fangamer

**Introduction**

Fangamer LLC (“Fangamer”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) is committed to the safety and protection of our customer’s information. As such, this Privacy Policy is intended to help you better understand how we collect, use, store, and disclose your personal information and how you can request access, correct, portability, or deletion of such information.

**Who does this policy apply to?**

This Privacy Policy applies to any of the following (collectively, the “Services”):

  3. Individuals who register and/or **attend Fangamer’s online or offline events**. (“Events”)

This Privacy Policy does not apply to starmen.net, forum.starmen.net, or forum.fangamer.com, (collectively “Starmen.Net websites”) which has a separate policy; no data is shared between the Services and the Starmen.Net websites except for incidental HTTP referral tracking information from your browser.

When we say “Customer” we are referring to the person or entity that is registered with us through either a Purchase or the Websites. When we say “you” or “your”, we are referring to Customers and/or to some other individual who visits any of our Websites or attends our Events or makes use of any Offerings.

“Partner” refers to any third party that Fangamer has a contractual relationship with a significant intellectual property interest to products offered, such as a developer, publisher, artist, or licensor. A “Service Provider” refers to any other third party that Fangamer has a contractual relationship to help provide the Services but has no intellectual property relationship to the products being sold, such as a third-party carrier or analytics service.

**When and how do we collect this information?**

  * When you purchase products, send us an email, connect with our customer service team via any medium, or communicate with us in any way, you are **voluntarily giving us information** that we collect. By giving us this information, you consent to this information being collected, used, disclosed, transferred, and stored by us as described in this Privacy Policy.
  * When you use the Services, we may **automatically collect information** about your visit to our Websites, your usage of the Services, and your web browsing. This includes: 
    * **information about how and when you use the Services** , store it in log files or other types of files associated with your account, and link it to other information we collect about you. This information may include, for example, your IP address, time, date, browser used, your browser ID, your browsing activity, and other information about how you interacted with our Websites. This type of information helps us to improve our Services for both you and for all of our Customers.

You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level through its settings and preferences.
    * **web beacons** , also called pixel tags, on our Websites and in our emails. When we send emails to you, we may track behavior such as who opened the emails and who clicked the links. This allows us to measure the performance of our email campaigns and to improve our features for specific segments of Customers. To do this, we include a single pixel tag in emails we send. These tags allow us to collect information about when you open the email, your IP address, your browser or email client type, and other similar details.
  * Our Websites may include **social media features** , such as liking or sharing products, or offering our products available for sale directly through a social media website. These features may collect information about your IP address and which page you are visiting on our Website, and they may set a cookie to make sure the feature functions properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Website. We also maintain presences on social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, and Pinterest. Any information, communications, or materials you submit to us via a social media platform is done at your own risk without any expectation of privacy. We cannot control the actions of other users of these platforms or the actions of the platforms themselves. Your interactions with those features and platforms are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide them.
  * We may, from time to time, obtain **information about you from third party sources** , including Partners requesting us to deliver products to you or payments and purchases from social media websites. We take steps to ensure that such third parties are legally permitted or required to disclose such information to us. Examples of the information we may receive from other sources include: names, email address, physical addresses, phone numbers, and other fulfillment data. We use this information, alone or in combination with other information we collect, to provide you with Services.

  * Personal information may also be shared with a company that acquires our business, and we may assign or transfer this Privacy Policy to said company, in the event of a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or other similar transaction or proceeding of all our part of our business. If this happens, we will post a notice on our home page.

**How long do we keep your information?**

Fangamer retains your information we receive as described in this Privacy Policy for as long as you use our Services or as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, provide our Services, provide you with invoices, receipts, or information of past Services rendered, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate interests, enforce our agreements, and comply with applicable laws. To dispose of personal data, we may anonymize it, delete it or take other appropriate steps. Data may persist in copies made for backup and business continuity purposes for additional time.

**How do we keep your personal information secure?**

We follow industry standards on information security management to safeguard sensitive information, such as financial information, customer details, and any other personal information entrusted to us.

Our credit card processor performs annual audits to ensure our handling of your credit card information aligns with industry guidelines. They are certified as a PCI DSS Level 1 compliant service provider, which is the highest level of compliance available, and their platform is audited annually by a third-party qualified security assessor.

No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal information.

**How do we protect your personal information across borders?**

Fangamer primarily stores personal information sent or collected via or by Fangamer in the United States, in the cloud, our servers, or the servers of our third parties and Service Providers. To facilitate global logistics, we may transfer and access such information from around the world. For example, your address may be required to be on a printed label of a package, and may be accessible by the applicable logistics provider who may be handling your package on its way to the destination country. Personal information may be accessible to law enforcement, customs enforcement, or other authorities pursuant to a lawful request. By providing information to Fangamer, you consent to the transfer and storage of personal information in these locations.

**Anything else that should be known?**

The Services are not targeted to children under the age of 13 or the age of majority in their territory. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal data from children under 13 or the age of majority in their territory; if you are a child under 13 or the age of majority in your territory, please do not use the Services or send any personal data about yourself to us. If we learn we have collected personal data from a child under 13 or the age of majority in their territory, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 or the age of majority in their territory may have provided us personal data, please contact us at [orders@fangamer.com](mailto:orders@fangamer.com?subject=Personal%20Data%20Request) with subject “Personal Data Request” and identifying the specific data to delete.

Your California Privacy Rights: If you are a California resident, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits you to request information regarding the disclosure of your personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Once a year you may email us at [orders@fangamer.com](mailto:orders@fangamer.com?subject=Personal%20Data%20Request) with subject “Personal Data Request” to know if we have sent any of your information to third-parties for the purposes of direct marketing.

Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. At this time, there is no general agreement on how companies like Fangamer should interpret DNT signals. Therefore, Fangamer does not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, whether that signal is received on a computer or a mobile device.

**How is this Privacy Policy updated?**

We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time without prior notice. Please review this policy periodically, and especially before you provide any information. This Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated below. Your continued use of the Services after any changes or revisions to this Privacy Policy shall indicate your agreement with the terms of such revised Privacy Policy.
