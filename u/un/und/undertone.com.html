                           <p>Undertone is an advertising network that may deliver  advertisements to the websites you visit.  Undertone understands that your online privacy  is important to you. We have created the  following Privacy Policy to let you know what information we collect on this website and when we serve advertisements on our network of websites owned by  third-party publishers (collectively, the "Undertone Site Network"),  how such information is used, and how it is shared with third parties if shared  at all. </p>
                           <p><strong>Please read this privacy policy  carefully. Use of the Undertone Site  Network, this website and your sharing of information with us is subject to  the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. By using the Undertone Site Network, this website or sharing information with us, you  give your agreement to this Privacy Policy. The Privacy Policy may be revised or updated  at any time by us as further described below.</strong></p>
                           <p><strong>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not govern or extend to Intercept  Interactive's customer form business in which a web visitor completes a form or  provides personal information as a response to an ad, including offers and  promotions ("Customer Form Ads"). That is  addressed by a separate privacy policy found at this link: <a href="http://www.interceptinteractive.com/aboutus/privacy.php" target="_blank">Customer Form Privacy Policy</a>.</strong></p>
                           <p>The terms  "you," "your," and "yours" refer to the website  visitor or consumer. The terms  "Undertone," "we," "us," and "our"  refer to Undertone Networks, and the companies under its control (such as subsidiaries),  or under common control (such as parent companies, or companies owned by its  parent company) (collectively, "Undertone Entities").</p>

                                Information We Collect</h2>
                           <h3>Ad Delivery &amp; Reporting Across Multiple Sites</h3>
                           <p>
                                As part of  our ad delivery and reporting, we log page views and collect information for  the purpose of delivering ads or providing advertising-related services,  including providing a specific advertisement based on a particular type of  browser or time of day; statistical reporting in connection with the activity  on a website; and tracking the number of ads served on a particular day to a  particular website. To do so, we  collect information about the type of browser and operating system of website  visitors, as well as the domain name, day and time of visit, and page(s)  visited. We do so across multiple web  domains owned or operated by different entities (each, a "Site").</p>
                           <h3>Relevant Advertising</h3>
                           <p>                                We want to  deliver more relevant advertising to you.  Delivering more relevant advertising to you and other website visitors  allows website owners to generate more advertising revenue. This revenue pays for the free content that  they may publish for you, or free services that they may deliver to you. It also means that you are more likely to see  online advertising that meets your interests.</p>
                           <p>In an effort  to deliver relevant advertising to you, we collect data across multiple web  domains owned or operated by different entities to categorize likely consumer  interest segments for use in advertising online ("Online Behavioral  Advertising" or "OBA").  For example, we can analyze aggregate, anonymous data to determine that  a visitor of a particular Site at 6:30PM is more likely to be interested in  Pizza, or antique cars, or a classic movie.  We can then serve an ad to the web page the visitor is viewing that  offers a discounted Pizza, car show tickets, or classic movie DVD—importantly—without ever knowing the identity or personal information of the  visitor.</p>
                           <p>If you do  not wish to benefit from relevant advertising, please feel free opt out OBA as  described in the paragraph titled "OBA Opt-Out", below.</p>
                           <h3>Internet Technology</h3>
                           <p>
                                We collect  the information described above by using log files, web beacons and  cookies. We often engage or cooperate  with service and technology companies to collect this information. While this tracking and collection technology  is commonly used, you might not be familiar with it, and we would like to  explain it:</p>
                           <ul>
                                <li>"Log files" track actions occurring on websites and  collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service  provider, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, click data and  types of advertisements viewed. </li>
                                <li>"web beacons" are electronic files used to  track your navigation of a website or collection of sites, the completion of  transactions, submittal of applications and browsing behavior. </li>
                                <li>"Cookies" are files (e.g. HTTP cookies)  that are stored on your Internet enabled device (which includes your computer,  BlackBerry or other PDA). Cookies are mostly used to record what pages and ads  you have already viewed. Cookies are  used to facilitate website navigation (for example, so your bank knows that  you logged in), make sure that you are forwarded to the appropriate website when  you click on an ad, and generally improve your web browsing experience. Cookies are also used to control the  delivery of a series of advertisements to a web browser, and to limit the  number of times a web browser receives any one advertisement. We also use cookies to estimate the total  reach of an advertising campaign, as well as frequency of display. You can learn more about cookies on the  Internet Advertising Bureau's website <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/cookies/what-information-in-cookie.html" target="_blank">www.allaboutcookies.org/cookies/what-information-in-cookie.html</a>.</li>
                           </ul>
                           <p>We use the  information we collect for marketing and advertising purposes, to determine  which ads perform well, to better match ads and website content to your  interests, to assist us in improving the operation of our services, to maintain  the quality of our services, to enhance our services to our business partners  and clients, to provide general statistics to our business partners and clients  regarding use of Undertone's services, and for the other purposes described  below. </p>

                                We do not collect data that includes a name, address, telephone number,  email address, government-issued identification, or data that likewise would  identify a specific individual ("Personal Identifiable Information"  or "PII"), except: </p>

We also may share information  with advertisers, publishers and other third parties for marketing and  advertising purposes, but such information does not include PII except if you  provided it as part of the Customer Form Ad Business described above. While  Undertone strongly encourages its advertising customers, service providers,  partners, and members of the Undertone Site Network to adopt responsible  approaches to online marketing, Undertone is not responsible for the  information practices of any of third party entities referenced in this  paragraph, which may use the information we share with them for the same  purposes as we use the information, or for their own independent purposes. The  collection, use, and disclosure of information by clients and partners are  subject to their respective privacy policies, which may differ from this  Privacy Policy. </p>

                                In the event that Undertone is acquired by or merged  with a third party entity, we reserve the right to transfer or assign the  information we have collected from you as part of such merger, acquisition,  sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy,  insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of  creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting  creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your information  is treated, transferred, or used. </p>

Although we choose our  business partners and clients carefully, Undertone is not responsible for the  privacy practices of websites operated by such third parties.

                           <p>Your Internet browser stores OBA-related data as cookies. If you have cookies disabled, if you delete  your cookies, or if other software deletes the cookies used for that data  storage, such data is lost because it is not retained separately by  Undertone. The cookies that store data  related to Undertone's OBA will in any case expire one year after the last time  such information is stored, barring any technical malfunction.</p>
                           <p> Undertone retains information regarding ad delivery (see, "Ad Delivery  &amp; Reporting" above) for up to six (6) months. However, Undertone may retain aggregate  statistics, reports and summaries regarding ad delivery for a longer  period.</p>
                           <p> Undertone may delete any or all of OBA or information regarding ad  delivery that relates to you at any time and in Undertone's sole discretion,  notwithstanding its normal data retention policies. Further, Undertone reserves the right to  retain and use any information described in this Privacy Policy as reasonably  necessary to comply with laws or regulations, notwithstanding any limitations  described in this Privacy Policy to the contrary. If Undertone changes its retention data  policies by updating this Privacy Policy, its new policies will apply to all  data then retained by Undertone.</p>

                           <p> If you would like to opt out of OBA, then we offer  "opt-out cookies" to block the tracking and placement<strong> </strong>of future  Undertone cookies for OBA purposes on your system for five (5) years. We may increase  this period, which means your opt-out choice will continue for a longer period. If you have multiple Internet browsers or  users on the same computer, you will need to perform the opt-out operation for  each browser and/or user.

                                Undertone transitioned  away from a third-party ad service company in July 2009. If you opted  out of targeted advertising between August 2008 and June 2009, you should opt-out  again to ensure that your choice is saved and recognized by our ad server. <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">Click Here  to Install the Undertone Opt-Out Cookies.</a></p>
                           <p>                                While  we enjoy offering you the ability to opt out of OBA, you should know that the  opt-out technology, as with most computer technology, is not foolproof.  We cannot promise and do not guarantee that our computer systems or those  of our vendors will always function properly to exclude you from OBA even  thought we work towards that result. To ensure your choice, you may want  to revisit the opt-out page and refresh your selection from time to time.</p>

                           <p>The European Union ("EU") maintains strict  privacy laws. These rules differ significantly from the laws of the United  States of America ("US"). To reconcile these differences, the US and the EU  have created a safe harbor ("Safe Harbor") that defines mutually acceptable  privacy operations. For more information see <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor" target="_blank">www.export.gov/safeharbor</a>. By providing information to us, you acknowledge  that we operate in the US and you agree to (i) permit us to transmit and use  your user information anywhere necessary, including across international  boundaries, to better improve the services and transactions provided by  Undertone; and (ii) that such use by us shall be subject to the terms and  conditions stated in this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use. </p>

                           <p>Undertone employs standard measures to ensure the  security of all information. We  routinely evaluate our practices to identify security threats or opportunities  for the improvement of our services. No transmission of information is  guaranteed to be completely secure. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or  software failure, and other factors may compromise data security. You  acknowledge and agree to assume these risks when communicating with us. </p>

                           <p>Undertone may find it appropriate or necessary, or may  be legally obligated, to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we  do, we will post those changes on this page and update the effective date  (found at the bottom) so that you have a way to always become aware of the  information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose  it. For changes to this Privacy Policy  that may be materially less restrictive on our use or disclosure of information  you have already provided to us, we will attempt to obtain your consent (if we  have the necessary contact information) before implementing such revisions with  respect to such information, or notify you either by placing a prominent notice  on the home page of our website or by directly sending you a notification. For  all other changes, it is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy  frequently and remain informed about any changes to it, so we encourage you to  visit this page often. </p>
