# Privacy Policy

### Privacy Policy

We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our website visitors at under-link.com; this policy sets out how we will treat your personal information. 

**1\. What information do we collect?**

We may collect, store and use the following kinds of personal data:

\- (a) information about your computer and about your visits to and use of this website (including your IP address, geographical location, browser type, referral source, length of visit and number of page views);

\- (b) information relating to any transactions carried out between you and us on or in relation to this website, including information relating to any advertising purchases or game uploads you make;

\- (c) information that you provide to us for the purpose of subscribing to our website services, email notifications, newsletters and/or RSS feeds;

\- (d) any other information that you choose to send to us.

**2\. Cookies**

A cookie consists of information sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The information is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser. 

We may use both “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies on the website. We will use the session cookies to: keep track of you whilst you navigate the website. We will use the persistent cookies to: enable our website to recognise you when you visit.

Session cookies will be deleted from your computer when you close your browser. Persistent cookies will remain stored on your computer until deleted, or until they reach a specified expiry date.

Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies. (For example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookies by clicking “Tools”, “Internet Options”, “Privacy”, and selecting “Block all cookies” using the sliding selector.) This will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites, including this one.

Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on this website. The DART cookie used by Google enables it to serve ads to our users based on their visit to other sites on the Internet.

Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the [Google ad and content network privacy policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20140403200340id_/http%3A//external.html?link=http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).
