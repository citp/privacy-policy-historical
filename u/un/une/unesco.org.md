# Our Online Privacy Policy

UNESCO is committed to protecting individual privacy and securing the personal information made available to us when you visit unesco.org, as well UNESCO pages on other sites (such as official UNESCO profiles on social networks).

This privacy policy describes what information is made available to the UNESCO and third parties when you visit unesco.org or official UNESCO pages on other sites, and how the UNESCO uses and stores that information.

If you have questions about this policy or suggestions for its improvement, please let us know.  You can contact us at <http://en.unesco.org/contact/privacy>.

We will revise or update this policy if our practices change, or as we develop better ways to keep you informed about them. You should refer back to this page often for the latest information and the effective date of any changes. If we decide to change this policy, we will post a new policy on our site and change the date at the bottom. Changes to the policy shall not apply retroactively.
