# Privacy Statement | IHE Delft Institute for Water Education

IHE Delft Institute for Water Education will make every effort to protect your privacy. In this privacy statement we will explain how we handle your personal details. We process personal details in accordance with the Personal Data Protection Act (Wbp) and the General Data Protection Regulation (AVG), which will replace the Wbp as from 25 May 2018.

This statement applies to the information that has been collected to be used in computerized systems within the Institute, including our websites. This statement does not apply to websites that mention IHE Delft, but the content of which we are unable to influence directly. 

## Collecting your personal details

IHE Delft collects personal details (if this is necessary) in order to provide services, to conduct transactions, to register students in its programmes, to distribute information or to grant access.

We may collect information on the following categories of data subjects (persons):

  * Prospective students
  * Students
  * Alumni
  * Staff, including applicants, temporary staff, doctoral candidates, and visiting researchers
  * External staff, including guest employees



Personal details are usually provided by the data subject (person). If necessary, this information may be sent to or entered into another system within the Institute, from an internal source system. We also receive personal details from the systems of third parties, which may be closed source systems such as Duo2Bron or an open source system such as Twitter.

We may also collect your details if you leave them on the Institute’s websites, in order to keep you informed of the diverse activities at the institute.

It is also permitted to collect personal information within the Institute within the framework of scientific research. This concerns the personal details of participants in a study. This information is processed in accordance with the law and the ‘Code of conduct for the use of personal details in scientific research’ (VSNU). If medical details are involved, Federa’s relevant [codes of conduct](https://www.federa.org/) will also apply (the codes on ‘Good conduct’ and ‘Proper Use’).

## Website and web systems

IHE Delft uses various tools to make its websites more user-friendly and to ensure that they function optimally. This includes measuring surfing behaviour using web statistics and other systems that are integrated into the website to collect active feedback from users or to conduct research with various versions of websites.

## Contact by e-mail

We roughly distinguish two types of automated email: transactional email that you have initiated/requested yourself, and recruiting email. Transactional email is an essential part of a service that you have chosen, such as resetting a password or confirming an application or a request for information. You therefore cannot unsubscribe for this type of email.

If you have consented to receiving recruiting emails such as newsletters or invitations to events, you may withdraw your consent. This type of email has opt-out options. Due to the decentralized nature of email communication, there is no institute-wide opt-out option.

Just as for the websites, IHE Delft uses analysis tools to analyse the reading and clicking behaviour for newsletters in order to analyse and improve our newsletters. We do not however link this information to your personal details.
