                          is handled safely and responsibly. As you will see in the

                          very seriously and are committed to providing you with the

                          to deliver to you quality products and services. Furthermore,
                          we are continually assessing new technology as it becomes
                          available to continue to best protect your privacy.</p>

                          we disclose?</span><br>
                          UNFCU collects, uses and retains information about you
                          only for specific business purposes. This is necessary in
                          administering our business for you and in providing competitive
                          products, services, and other opportunities that will satisfy your
                          financial service needs. We collect the following “nonpublic
                        personal information” about you from the following sources:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li> Information we receive from you on applications or other
                          forms, such as your name, address, social security number,
                          assets, and income;</li>
                          <li> Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates, and<br>
  third parties, such as the account balance, payment history,<br>
  transactions; and</li>
                          <li> Information we receive from consumer-reporting agencies,<br>
  such as your creditworthiness and credit history.</li>
                        </ul>                        
                        <p>At times, it becomes necessary to provide to third parties 
                          nonpublic personal information about you that we collect in 
                          order to facilitate transaction processing and provide support 
                          or services for one or more of our products. Examples of 
                          these third parties would include title insurance companies, 
                          statement production vendors, collection agencies, credit card 
                          service bureaus, and cheque service providers. In addition,<br>
                          UNFCU may provide nonpublic personal information about you
                          to specially selected third parties who offer enhanced products 
                          and services such as GlobalPhone Corporation. These third

                          safeguard your confidential information with the same

                          We have implemented procedures to help ensure that 
                          member financial information is maintained in a manner that 
                          will ensure it is accurate, current and complete. If you have

                          For your protection, UNFCU staff is required to verify the 
                          identity of the individual who is requesting the account 
                          information. Only you and verified joint accountholders are 
                          entitled to obtain information about your account. We thank 
                          you for cooperating with our identification procedures when 
                        you contact us. </p>
                        <p>We limit staff access to confidential member information only 
                          to those employees with a business reason for knowing such 
                          information. UNFCU educates its staff so that they understand 
                          the importance UNFCU places on confidentiality and member 
                          privacy. In addition, we maintain security standards and 
                          procedures to help prevent unauthorized access to confidential 
                          information about you. Member privacy is also addressed in the 
                          UNFCU Employee Handbook, and any staff who violates this 
                          policy will be subject to appropriate disciplinary measures. We  
                          do not reveal specific information about your accounts or other 
                          personally identifiable data to unaffiliated third parties for their 
                        independent use, unless:</p>

                          UNFCU maintains and follows strict security standards and 
                          procedures designed to guard against unauthorized access to 
                          and disclosure of confidential member information. Whenever 
                          reasonably possible, we will use security-coding techniques 
                          to protect against unauthorized access to your personal 
                          records, ensure accuracy and integrity of communications<br>
                        and transactions, and protect your confidentiality. </p>

                          Centre. This information is shared in order to market additional  
                          products and services, and to ensure we consider your entire

                          and services we provide to you. Examples of such information
