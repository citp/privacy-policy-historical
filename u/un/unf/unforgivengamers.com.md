# Privacy Policy - UnforgivenGamers

First of all, please note that we are not responsible for any messages posted by our users. We do not vouch for or warrant the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of any message, and are not responsible for the contents of any message.

The messages express the views of the author of the message, not necessarily the views of UnforgivenGamers.com. Any user who feels that a posted message is objectionable is encouraged to contact us immediately by email. We have the ability to remove objectionable messages and we will make every effort to do so, within a reasonable time frame, if we determine that removal is necessary.

Please think about what you wish to share. Everything you publish on UnforgivenGamers.com may be visible to the public and may never be removed at all.

You agree, through your use of this service, that you will not use UnforgivenGamers.com to post any material which is knowingly false and/or defamatory, inaccurate, abusive, vulgar, hateful, harassing, obscene, profane, sexually oriented, threatening, invasive of a person's privacy, or otherwise violative of any law.

You agree not to post any copyrighted material unless the copyright is owned by you or by UnforgivenGamers.com.

While we do not allow any malicious activity from our members, and do our best to eliminate it, UnforgivenGamers.com members are often the target of such activity, whether by an outsider, or a rogue member. If you notice any kind of malicious activity from a member, please report it to our staff by using the reports system or by private messaging a staff member. We will be happy to assist you! The said content will be removed, and the member responsible for it warned or banned.

The owner of this site will not be liable to you (whether under the law of contact, the law of torts or otherwise) in relation to the contents of, or use of, or otherwise in connection with, this website:

to the extent that the website is available;

for any indirect, special or consequential loss; or

for any business losses, loss of revenue, income, profits or anticipated savings, loss of contracts or business relationships, loss of reputation or goodwill, or loss or corruption of information or data.

 **The way we use information**

We do not share your personal information with third parties except to the extent necessary when the law requires us to comply.

Please remember that you are responsible for any of your actions on this website.

We use email addresses to answer the emails we receive, to verify upon registration, to send opt-in only contacts such as thread subscriptions and PM notifications. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.

 **Our commitment to privacy**

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available from every page where personally identifiable information may be requested.

Our websites use cookies to distinguish you from other users of our website. This helps us to provide you with a personalised experience when you browse this site.

We use third party advertisement on our website. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).

You have the possibility to opt out here: [Opt out](http://www.google.com/ads/preferences).

You can also choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites. This will include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.

 **Our commitment to children's privacy**

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important to us. For that reason, no part of our website is structured to attract any individual under the age of 13.
