# UNFCU :: About UNFCU :: Disclosures :: Privacy Policy

###### Internet Privacy

**When you visit our website at www.unfcu.org, we want you to feel secure that we are respecting your privacy.** The majority of the UNFCU website is protected with 128 bit SSL encryption. This encryption protects the user’s information from being viewed by an unauthorized party. We protect your account information by placing it on the secure portion of our website. That is why you have to enter a unique member number and password each time you want to access your account information. In addition, you can click on “Log Out” located throughout Internet Banking to securely exit your account without closing your browser. Your password should never be shared with anyone.

###### (A) General Website Pages

When you browse through the UNFCU website and have not registered for any online service from UNFCU, you browse anonymously. Personal information—such as your name, address, phone number or email address—is not collected as you browse. UNFCU does, however, collect and store information, or “cookies,” on the domain you use to access our website. This includes the internet address of the site from which you linked directly to our site, and the date and time of your visit to our website. This information is used to measure the number of visitors to the various pages on the UNFCU website. This information helps us make improvements to the site and better serve our members through special marketing programs.

###### (B) Restricted Account Access Website Pages 

Personal identifying information is collected when a member registers to access his/her UNFCU account(s) via the Internet. This information enables UNFCU to regulate entry to the restricted portions of its website and to measure member usage. Any personal identifying information gathered during member registrations is not shared with third parties.

###### (C) Third Parties 

UNFCU will make full disclosure online when information is being collected for transference to, or usage by other parties. Please note that by accessing a link that appears on the UNFCU website, which redirects you to a website hosted by another party, you will no longer be subject to, or under the protection of the privacy and security policies of our website. We encourage you to read and evaluate the privacy and security policies on the site you are entering, which may be different than ours.

###### (D) Personal Information 

Personal information contained in email sent by members and non-members may be used by UNFCU staff and volunteers to answer questions, to follow up on suggestions or complaints, or to improve the level of service UNFCU provides. We may use information you have given us to provide a service, ensure proper billing, measure consumer interest in our various services, and inform you about products and services.
