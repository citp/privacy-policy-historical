        <h1>UNFUDDLE PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

<p>Subventurate LLC (“Subventurate”) operates several websites including <a href="http://unfuddle.com">unfuddle.com</a> and <a href="http://unfuddled.com">unfuddled.com</a>. It is Subventurate’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>

<h2>Website Visitors</h2>

<p>Like most website operators, Subventurate collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Subventurate’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Subventurate’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Subventurate may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

<p>Subventurate also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Subventurate does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.</p>

<h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>

<p>Certain visitors to Subventurate’s websites choose to interact with Subventurate in ways that require Subventurate to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Subventurate gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for projects at unfuddle.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Subventurate – by purchasing access to the Unfuddle service, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Subventurate collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Subventurate. Subventurate does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

<h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>

<p>Subventurate may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Subventurate may monitor the most popular projects on the unfuddle.com site. Subventurate may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Subventurate does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

<h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>

<p>Subventurate discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Subventurate’s behalf or to provide services available at Subventurate’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Subventurate’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Subventurate will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Subventurate discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Subventurate believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Subventurate, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Subventurate website and have supplied your email address, Subventurate may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Subventurate and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Subventurate takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Subventurate uses cookies to help Subventurate identify and track visitors, their usage of Subventurate website, and their website access preferences. Subventurate visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Subventurate’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Subventurate’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

<h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>

<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Subventurate may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Subventurate’s sole discretion. Subventurate encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
