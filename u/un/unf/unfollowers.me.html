<p>Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share and protect information in relation to our mobile services, web site, and any software provided on or in connection with Statusbrew services (collectively, the "Service"), and your choices about the collection and use of your information.
By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to perform actions, post content, including photos, comments and other materials ("User Content"), to the Service.</p>
<p>The Services by their nature allow our customers to connect their accounts through the APIs of our various Supported Platforms (such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram) and any applications developed by third parties that Statusbrew does not own or control (“Third-Party Apps”) that our customers choose to access. This Privacy Policy does not cover any information or other content you can view via the Services on Supported Platforms (but which was not posted there using the Services) or information you provide to Third-Party Apps accessed via the Services. While we attempt to facilitate access only to those Supported Platforms and Third-Party Apps that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of any Supported Platforms or Third-Party Apps. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Supported Platforms or Third-Party Apps you access via the Services.</p>
<p>Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service ("Users").</p>

<h3 id="analytics-information-">Analytics information:</h3>
<p>We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual User.
However, in cases when there is a service bug, failure or any other important alert, we may store analytics for that bug, failure or alert which can be used to identify a particular user.</p>
<h3 id="log-file-information-">Log file information:</h3>
<p>Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or app is downloaded to your browser or device.</p>
<p>When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</p>
<h3 id="device-identifiers-">Device identifiers:</h3>
<p>When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Statusbrew.
A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.</p>
