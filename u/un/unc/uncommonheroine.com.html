      <h3>Information Collection</h3>
      <p>We may collect personal information that can identify you such as your 
      name and e-mail address, as well as other information that does not 
      identify you. When you provide personal information through our Sites, the 
      information may be sent to our servers located in the United States and 
      other countries around the world.</p>
      <p><strong>User Provided Information.</strong> We may collect and store 
      any personal information you enter on our Sites or provide to us in some 
      other manner. This includes identifying information (such as your name, 
      e-mail address), and any other personal information you choose to provide 
      while using our Sites or the Services. </p>
      <p><strong>Third Party List Information.</strong> We may also obtain both 
      personal and non-personal information about you from third party data 
      gathering sources. We may match this third-party collected information 
      with the personally identifying information that you provide to us. When 
      obtaining this information from third parties, Dotzup.com™ seeks 
      assurances form the third parties that it has the right to provide the 
      information to us.</p>
      <p><strong>Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Information Collection 
      Technology.</strong> We use various technologies to collect information 
      from your computer and about your activities on our Sites. For example, we 
      collect and store non-personally identifying information through log 
      files, cookies, clear gifs ("web beacons"), and third parties to create a 
      profile of our users that details the users' viewing preferences.</p>
      <p><strong>Log Files</strong>. Technical information from your browser is 
      automatically collected when you visit our Sites. This information 
      includes your IP address, your browser type, operating system, access 
      times, the content of any undeleted cookies that your browser previously 
      accepted from us (see "Cookies" below), and the referring website 
      address.</p>
      <p><strong>Cookies.</strong> A cookie is a piece of data stored on a 
      user's computer that tracks non-personal information about the user. When 
      using our Sites, we may assign your computer one or more cookies which 
      enable us to improve the quality of our Service and to personalize your 
      experience. Cookies allow us to automatically collect information about 
      your activity on our Sites, such as the web pages you visit, the links or 
      advertisements you click, or the other actions you conduct while using our 
      Sites. The cookies do not store any personally identifiable information 
      about you. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually 
      modify your browser setting to disable cookies. If you choose to disable 
      cookies, you will still be able to access our Sites, but you may not be 
      able to use all of the interactive features we offer. Additional 
      information on cookies can be found at: 
      http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.htm.</p>
      <p><strong>Web Beacons.</strong> We, or our advertisers, may use standard 
      Internet technology such as web beacons (or "clear gifs"), tracking 
      pixels, and other similar technologies, to gather aggregate, 
      non-personally identifiable information about your use of our Sites. We 
      also may include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters 
      to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. This allows 
      us to gauge the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and the quality of 
      our Sites.</p>
      <p><strong>Information collected by third-parties.</strong> We and our 
      business partners, such as advertisers, may use tracking technologies, 
      such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact 
      with these advertisements and connect to other websites. This information 
      allows us and our business partners to deliver targeted advertisements and 
      gauge their effectiveness. Please note that we do not have access to or 
      control over third parties' cookies used on our Sites, and this policy 
      does not govern the use of cookies by these third parties. Some of these 
      third-party advertising partners may be members of the Network Advertising 
      Initiative ("NAI"), which offers internet users a single location to opt 
      out of ad targeting from member companies. For additional information 
      about NAI or to opt out, please go to the NAI Non-PII Opt-Out Page at <a href="http://www.stevestinson.com/www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http:www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Sponsor or Link Websites</strong>. Links or sponsor websites 
      may be presented in a manner that allows us to keep track of whether the 
      links or sponsor sites have been used. We use this information to improve 
      the quality of our Sites, to track advertising, and to personalize your 
      online experience. Please be aware, however, that we are not responsible 
      for the privacy practices of other websites.</p>
      <p><strong>No Information From Children.</strong> Dotzup.com™ will never 
      knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 
      13. If we obtain actual knowledge that we have collected personal 
      information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be 
      immediately deleted from our database. Because we do not collect such 
      information, we have no such information to use or to disclose to third 
      parties. The Sites target an audience that is over the age of 18 and some 
      content may not be appropriate for all ages. We recommend that minors over 
      the age of 13 ask their parents for permission before sending any 
      information about themselves to anyone over the Internet. We have designed 
      our privacy policy in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy 
      Protection Act ("COPPA").</p>

      <p>PLEASE NOTE THAT WE MAY USE INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION FOR ANY LEGALLY 
      PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION. We may match any of the 
      technical information we gather to any personally identifying information 
      we have obtained through you or third parties to provide you offers and 
      improve the content of the Sites and Services for you. Examples of some of

      information, alone or in combination with non-personal information, with 
      third party service providers in connection with your request for Services 
      on our Sites. These service providers may include credit bureaus, 
      financial institutions, marketing and customer services firms, credit card

      <p><strong>Third parties for business reasons:</strong> In connection with 
      a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a

      addition, we may disclose your information when we believe it is 
      appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take 
      other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other 
      wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our 
      company, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable

      sell, or share aggregated demographic information not specifically 
      identifiable to you, and other non-personal information we collect, with

      targeted advertising, and to conduct general business analysis. We may 
      combine non-personal information we collect with additional non-personal 
      information collected from other sources. For example, we may tell our 
      advertisers the number of visitors to our Sites and the most popular 
      features or Services accessed.<br>Please note that our Privacy Policy does 
      not cover any third party's use or handling of your information once it is 
      shared. Rather, the privacy policies of the various third parties will 
      govern. If you want to learn more about their privacy practices, we 
      encourage you to visit the websites of those third parties. These entities 
      or their servers may be located either inside or outside the United

      our Sites and to review the privacy statements of each and every website 
      that you visit that collects personally identifiable information. This 
      Privacy Policy applies solely to information we collect. Please note that 
      we may present links in a format that enables us to understand whether 
      they have been followed for aggregating informational purposes.</p>
      <h3>Choice/Opt-Out</h3>
      <p>We give our users the opportunity to "opt-out" of having their 
      information used for purposes not directly related to our Sites at the 
      point where we ask for the information. Please be aware that this may

      receive communications from us but later wish to discontinue receiving 
      communications or our Services, you can opt-out by any of the following

      have to change your preferences directly with that third party. To opt-out

      <h3>Information Security</h3>
      <p>Dotzup.com™ takes appropriate security measures to protect our users' 
      information against unauthorized access, loss, alteration, or destruction. 
      These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and 
      processing practices and security measures, as well as digital encryption 
      and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to 
      systems where we store personal information. We restrict access to 
      personal information to employees, contractors, and agents who have a 
      "need-to-know" that information in order to operate, develop or improve 
      our Services, and who are bound by confidentiality requirements. We want 
      you to feel confident using our Sites to transact business. However, no 
      system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to 
      secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, 
      that your personal information, searches, or other communications will 
      always remain secure.</p>
      <h3>Visitors Outside the United States</h3>
      <p>This Privacy Policy is intended to cover collection of information on 
      our Sites from residents of the United States. The data protection and 
      other laws of the United States and other countries might not be as 
      comprehensive as those in your country. If you are visiting our Sites from 
      outside the United States, you acknowledge and agree that your information 
      may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where 
      our servers are located and our central database is operated. By using our 
      Services, you acknowledge and agree that your information may be 
      transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share 
      it as described in this privacy policy.</p>

      in our practices and Services. We reserve the right to modify it at any 
      time, so please review it frequently. When changes are made to this 
      Privacy Policy, we will revise the "last updated" date at the top of this 
      Privacy Policy. If we make any material changes in the way we collect, 
      use, and/or share personal information that may impact you, we will also 
      prominently post notice of the changes on our Sites and/or we may notify 
      you by sending an e-mail to the e-mail address you most recently provided 
      us in your account, profile or registration (unless we do not have such an 
      e-mail address or you have opted-out of such communication). Your 
      continued use of our Sites or Services after we have posted any Privacy 
      Policy changes indicates your agreement to the changes unless you notify 
      us otherwise.</p>
