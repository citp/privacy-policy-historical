  |  **Privacy protection**  
UncommonGoods respects and is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy protection section communicates how, when, and why we gather information about our customers and what we do with it. 

**Why shopping at UncommonGoods is safe**  
We have taken many precautions to insure that shopping at UncommonGoods is safe and secure. We use the industry-standard SSL protocol (Secure Sockets Layer) to ensure that all credit card transactions are secure. The SSL system encrypts information that you submit to us via our Web site when you place an order. Encryption makes it extremely difficult for anyone to intercept information about you, your order, or your credit card information. 

**Order information**  
If you place an order through UncommonGoods, we will ask you for your e-mail address, shipping address, telephone number and credit card information. We use this information to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status. All archived credit card information is maintained in a secure and safe environment. Telephone numbers and e-mail addresses are only used to contact you regarding your order, unless you request to receive our e-mail newsletter updates. 

**Sign up**  
We invite interested visitors to sign up for our mailing list to receive occasional e-mail alerts about special offers and promotions. When you sign up, we ask for your first name and e-mail address only. Also during sign up, visitors can opt to inform us about their product category preferences and how they heard about UncommonGoods. Again, we are committed to not selling, renting, or sharing your e-mail address with anyone. 

If you decide you no longer wish to receive e-mail from us, every e-mail we send to you includes simple instructions on how to opt out of future communications. You can also review opt-out instructions below. 

If you sign up to receive our catalog or make a purchase with UncommonGoods, you may receive information in the mail from other carefully screened companies whose products or services might interest you. If you would prefer not to receive a catalog from UncommonGoods, please see the opt-out instructions below. If you would prefer not to receive any information in the mail from other carefully screened companies, please send e-mail to [donotshare@uncommongoods.com](mailto:donotshare@uncommongoods.com), including your name and address or you may do the same by phone or mail, as detailed in the opt-out instructions below. 

**Use of cookies**  
UncommonGoods uses "cookies" for the sole purpose of enhancing your shopping experience. 

A cookie is a feature of your Internet Web browser, and most browsers are configured to automatically accept cookies. Cookies are files that your Web browser places on your computer's hard drive and which assign a unique identification code to your computer. Cookies do not enable us to retrieve from your computer any additional personal information about you other than information that you knowingly and willingly provide to UncommonGoods through the order process or through sign up. 

We use cookies to let us know whether you have visited UncommonGoods previously; to provide relevant, personalized content; and to help us continue to improve site navigation, design, and content. 

**Contests/Surveys**  
We may occasionally hold contests or post surveys on our site. Participation in contests and surveys is entirely optional. We may ask contest or survey participants for personal contact information, such as e-mail address, name, address, or telephone number which we may use to send participants information related to the contest or survey. We will not sell, rent, or share your e-mail address or phone with anyone. We may make your mailing address available to carefully screened companies whose products or services might interest you. If you have participated in contests or surveys in the past, but no longer wish to receive related information, you can opt out of receiving these future communications (see opt out instructions below). 

**Opt out**  
If you decide you no longer wish to receive communications from us, you can opt out by: 

  * **Contacting us at remove@uncommongoods.com**
  
At the bottom of every e-mail we send out is a line that reads: If you prefer not to receive e-mails from us, please e-mail us at [remove@uncommongoods.com.](mailto:remove@uncommongoods.com) Clicking on the link displays a mail form that has 'please remove' in the subject line. If you hit the send button, your name will be automatically removed from our e-mail list.
