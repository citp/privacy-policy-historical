# Internet Privacy Policy at the University of Northern Colorado

The University of Northern Colorado recognizes the importance of protection of individual privacy and is committed to protecting the information provided by our Web site visitors. The Internet Privacy Statement applies to all personally identifiable information, regardless of collection method. Collection methods that may occur automatically when you visit our Website

### Web visit logs

Certain information is collected automatically when you visit our University of Northern Colorado Website, including IP address (number assigned to a computer for accessing the Internet), type of browser, Internet Service Provider, pages visited, time spent on the site, date and time of the visit and country from which you access the Web site. The individual visitor is not identified from the visit. This information is collected to allow us to understand the needs of users and to analyze structure of our Website. 

### Network Traffic logs

In the process of ensuring network security and optimum performance, we may collect email headers and addresses. 

### Cookies

Cookies are small text files on your system, used for keeping track of settings or data for a particular Web site. You may turn them off through your browser or set your browser to notify you before accepting them. Some University Websites use cookies to store information necessary to provide a service or access into a site. Any information the University may store in cookies is used for internal purposes only. 

### Disclosure of personally identifiable information

The voluntary provision of personally identifiable information constitutes your consent for collection and disclosure of the information for the purpose indicated. For example, the information may be used by the appropriate university employee to contact you or provide requested service. 

We may provide information to service providers or agents of the University to enable them to carry out their assigned functions or provide a service to you but they are not allowed to disclose the information for any other purpose.

The State Open Records Act is applicable to this Privacy Policy pursuant to the Colorado Revised Statutes, Title 24, Article 72, Part 2, which states the following: "It is declared to be the public policy of this state that all public records shall be open for inspection by any person at reasonable times, except as provided in this part 2 or as otherwise specifically provided by law."

If personal information is requested on the website or is volunteered by the user, state and federal law may protect that information. However, all information becomes a public record once it is provided and may be subject to public inspection and copying if not protected by federal or state law.

The University may collect or disclose personally identifiable information without consent if disclosure is:

· Necessary to perform statutory duties.

· Regulated by state or federal guidelines.

· Made pursuant to a court order.

· Necessary to protect safety of the University, visitors or others.

· Necessary to enforce the rights of the University against unauthorized access or attempted unauthorized access to information technology assets.

Users are cautioned that the collection of personal information requested from or volunteered by children online or by email will be treated the same as information provided by an adult and may be subject to public access.

### Security

The University treats your personal information as an asset to be protected against loss or unauthorized access and has measures in place to ensure this protection. Despite security measures, we do not represent or warrant that personal information will be protected against unauthorized access or misuse. 

### Other Web links

The University Web site also provides links to Web pages outside of the university domain and is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these Web sites.
