Unleash the Gamer collects two types of data:

**Browsing data** – These cookies are essentially small files that act as markers to identify you. These cookies tell the website (and us) whether or not you’ve visited us before.

**Third Party Cookies:** These are used for everything related to ad targeting and behavioral advertising. By using tags, advertisers can track users across all devices they use across different websites. This process helps advertisers create a profile based on their habits, so messages can be catered toward their interests. However, these cookies only collect browsing data, not your personal information. 

**Security Cookies** :  An ultra-safe way to store information. Secure cookies are transmitted solely through HTTPS /HTTPS, and are incompatible with scripting languages such as JavaScript. Since this particular cookie is used solely for storing information (as well as for performing hypertext transfer protocol requests and data over the internet), scripting hackers are incapable of exploiting them.
