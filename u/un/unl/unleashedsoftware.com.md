# Privacy Policy - Unleashed Software

#### Introduction

At Unleashed, we care about the privacy of your data and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect about you and why, what we do with that information, and how we handle that information. 

This notice applies across all websites that we own and operate and all services we provide, including our online platform, mobile app, and any other services we may offer (for example, events or training). For the purpose of this notice, we’ll just call them our ‘services’.

When we say ‘personal data’ we mean identifiable information about you, like your name, email, address, telephone number, support queries, community comments and so on. If you can’t be identified (for example, when personal data has been aggregated and anonymised) then this notice doesn’t apply. Check out our [Terms & Conditions](https://web.archive.org/terms-and-conditions) for more information on how we treat your other data.

We may need to update this notice from time to time. Where a change is significant, we’ll make sure we let you know – usually by sending you an email or in app notification.
