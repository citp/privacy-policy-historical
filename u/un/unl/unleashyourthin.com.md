**_Provisions Applicable to Registrants_**

Please note the relevant portions of this Privacy Policy applicable to Registrants and those portions applicable to all Users, including Registrants. Visitors must register with the Site (“ _Registrants_ ”) in order to make use of certain features offered through the Site. When a Registrant submits personally identifiable information (“ _PII_ ”) to us, that Registrant gives us consent to the collection, use and disclosure of the PII.

**_Site Registration_**. By checking the box “Accept” on clearly identified portions of the Site, each Registrant agrees with and accepts to be bound by the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy. Failure to check the “Accept” box will prevent an individual from becoming a Registrant. Registrants may publish, display, or otherwise transmit directly or indirectly stories, messages, comments, information, images, graphics, photographs and other content (individually or collectively, “ _Registrant Content_ ”) to the Site, subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms & Conditions. NHS does not control Registrant Content and some parts of the Site may serve as public discussion forums open to many Registrants or Users. A Registrant should therefore tailor content submitted accordingly.

Our Site offers publicly accessible articles. A Registrant should be aware that any information provided while leaving comments within this area of our Site may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your PII from our articles, contact us at . In some cases, we may not be able to remove PII, in which case we will let a Registrant know if we are unable to do so and why.

Our Site also displays personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our site in addition to other endorsements. With your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at .

**_Notice._** NHS will inform Registrants about the purposes for which it collects and uses PII, the types of non-agent third parties to which NHS discloses that information, and the choices and means, if any, NHS offers Registrants for limiting the use and disclosure of their PII. NHS intends to use PII for the following reasons: (a) to present Site and contents to a Registrant, (b) to provide information, products and services requested by a Registrant, (c) to fulfill any other purposes for which you provide it, (d) to provide a Registrant with notices, (e) to carry out our obligations and enforce our rights, including billing and collection, (f) to notify a Registrant of changes to our Site or products and services we offer through it, (g) to display content and advertisements customized to the preferences or viewing behavior of Registrants, (h) to test different formats for the Site to gauge Visitor preferences, (i) to allow a Registrant to participate in interactive features of the Site, (j) in any other way we may describe when you provide the PII and (k) for any other purpose with a Registrant’s consent.

**_Choice._** NHS will offer Registrants the opportunity to choose (opt-out) whether their PII is (a) to be disclosed to a third party who is not an agent of NHS, or (b) to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the Registrant. For sensitive PII such as credit card information, NHS will give Registrants the opportunity to affirmatively and explicitly (opt-in) consent such disclosure or use.

**_Account Information._** NHS honors requests from customers for changes in account information, such as name and password and will use best efforts to correct any such information that is inaccurate.

**_PII._** Various types of PII may be collected from each Registrant in order for NHS to provide services. Such information may include name, mailing address, telephone numbers, email addresses, credit card information and other information that may be needed in order to provide the services requested by the Registrant. We obtain address information about you from third party sources, such as Experion, so that we can provide more relevant products and advertisements. NHS may also request statistical information about interests and lifestyle habits.

**_Data Integrity- Registrants._** NHS will use PII only in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. NHS will take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete and current.

**_Access._** Upon request, NHS will provide Registrants with the PII that it holds about them and will take reasonable steps to provide individuals with a means to correct, amend or delete information that is found to be inaccurate or incomplete. Users can request these changes by contacting us at support@naturalhealthsherpa.com. NHS will use reasonable efforts to respond to requests within 10 business days, but in no less than 30 days will provide a response to a Registrant that either (a) confirms that PII has been updated or deleted, (b) contains a timeline by which the request by be fulfilled or (c) offers a reason why the request cannot be fulfilled. NHS may also contact Registrants regarding improvements to the Site, or when you sign up to our newsletter subscription, to provide information regarding a Registrant’s account or with information about new services that are available or other information we deem helpful or interesting to you. A Registrant may opt-out and unsubscribe to these communications by (i) e-mailing “unsubscribe” to  or (ii) making your request by contacting us at 800-316-8556 In the event of communications from third parties, please follow that third party’s unsubscribe features.

We may also provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our Site. If you participate, we will request certain PII from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

**_Transfers to Third Parties- Registrants._** NHS will not knowingly disclose, sell, share or rent PII without a Registrant’s consent other than in certain exceptional circumstances, such as (a) to protect against hackers, (b) to protect our legal rights or protect us from liability, (c) to enforce an agreement with a Registrant, including the enforcement of the Terms & Conditions (d) address actual or threatened illegal or harmful conduct, (e) as required by legal or professional standards or requirements (including compliance with judicial or regulatory proceedings or orders), or (f) if we believe such disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of NHS, Users, Registrants or others. We may also disclose PII to third parties for credit card fraud protection and risk reduction as well as in the event NHS or its assets are sold, in which case NHS will notify Registrants by e-mail or prominent notice on the Site following the transaction. NHS will not authorize the release of credit card or account data with anyone not directly involved with processing the transactions.

We may provide your PII to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your PII only as necessary to provide these services to us.

**_Use By Minors._** A Registrant must be 18 years of age or older. NHS will not knowingly solicit or collect PII from anyone under 13 years of age.
