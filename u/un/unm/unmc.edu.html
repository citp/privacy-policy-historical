<p>This Notice applies to the following organizations and their clinics:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Nebraska Medical Center and its medical staff, including academic and private practice physicians, and allied health professionals while providing services at these locations, as an organized health care arrangement.�� </li>
    <li>The Bellevue Medical Center and its medical staff and allied health professionals as an organized healthcare arrangement. </li>
    <li>University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) </li>
    <li>UNMC Physicians </li>
    <li>Nebraska Pediatric Practice, Inc. </li>
    <li>University Dental Associates (UDA) </li>
</ul>
<p>The organizations listed above will use and distribute this Notice as their Joint Notice of Privacy Practices and follow the information practices described in this Notice when using or disclosing records and information. They will share your health information with each other, as necessary, to carry out treatment, payment, or health care operations as described in this Notice.</p>
<p><b>Understanding Your Health Information�</b>� <br>
<br>
Each time you visit a hospital, clinic, physician, or other health care provider, a record of your visit is made. Typically, this health record contains your medical history, symptoms, examination and test results, diagnosis, treatment, care plan, insurance, billing, and employment information. This health information, often referred to as your health record, serves as a basis for planning your care and treatment and is a vital means of communication among the many health professionals who contribute to your health care. Your health information is also used by insurance companies and other third-party payers to verify the appropriateness of billed services. </p>
<p><b>Our Responsibilities </b></p>
<p>�We are required by law to:</p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" type="disc">
    <li>Maintain the privacy of your health information. </li>
    <li>Provide you with an additional current copy of our Notice upon request. </li>
    <li>Abide by the terms of our current Notice. </li>
</ul>
<p>We will not use or disclose your health information without your written authorization, except as described in this Notice. Such authorization may be revoked in writing at any time except with respect to any actions we have taken in reliance on it.<br>
<br>
<b><br>
Examples of Using Health Information for Treatment, Payment and Health Care Operations <i><br>
<br>
We will use and disclose your health information for treatment purposes</i></b><i>.<br>
</i>For example: Information obtained by a nurse, physician or other member of your health care team will be recorded in your record and used to determine the course of treatment. Health care team members will communicate with one another personally and through the health record to coordinate care provided. We will also provide your physician or subsequent health care provider with copies of various reports that should assist him or her in treating you in the future.<br>
<br>
<b><i>We will use and disclose your health information for payment purposes.<br>
</i></b>For example: A bill may be sent to you or a third-party payer. The information on or accompanying the bill may include information that identifies you, as well as your diagnosis, procedures, and supplies used. We may disclose health information about you to other qualified parties for their payment purposes. For example, if you are brought in by ambulance, we may disclose your health information to the ambulance provider for its billing purposes. <br>
<br>
<b><i>We will use and disclose your health information for health care operations.<br>
</i></b>For example: Members of the medical staff, the risk or quality improvement manager, or members of the quality improvement team may use information in your health record to assess the care and outcomes in your case and others like it. This information will then be used in an effort to continually improve the quality and effectiveness of health care we provide. In some cases, we will furnish your health information to other qualified parties for their health care operations. The ambulance company, for example, may want information regarding your condition to help them know whether they have done an effective job of stabilizing your condition.</p>
<p><strong><em>Health Information Exchange </em></strong><br>
We may make your protected health information available electronically through an information exchange service to other health care providers, health plans and health care clearinghouses that request your information. Participation in information exchange services also lets us see their information about you. <br>
<br>
<b><i>Teaching<br>
</i></b>As the primary teaching site for UNMC, residents, fellows, and students in medicine, dentistry, nursing, pharmacy, allied health and graduate studies, may be assisting with your care under the supervision of a licensed health care provider as a part of their professional health care training program.�<br>
� </p>
<p><b>Other Uses and Disclosures of Your Health Information <i><br>
<br>
Notification<br>
</i></b>We may use or disclose health information to notify or assist in notifying a family member, personal representative, or another person responsible for your care of your location and general condition. <br>
<b><i></i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Communication With Family and Others<br>
</i></b>We may disclose relevant health information to a family member, friend, or other person involved in your care. We will only disclose this information if you agree, are given the opportunity to object and do not, or if in our professional judgment, it would be in your best interest to allow the person to receive the information or act on your behalf. <br>
<br>
<b><i>Directory<br>
</i></b>Unless you notify us that you object, or we are otherwise prohibited by law, we may use your name, location in the facility, general condition, and religious affiliation for directory purposes.

<br>
<b><i>Business Associates<br>

<br>
<b><i>Research<br>
</i></b>Research is conducted under strict UNMC Institutional Review Board (IRB) guidelines designed to protect the subjects of research. Health information about you may be disclosed to researchers preparing to conduct a research project. For example, it may be necessary for researchers to look for patients with specific medical characteristics or treatments. We would obtain your specific authorization prior to using your health information in research studies if information that directly identifies you is disclosed. The only exception would be granted under rare circumstances when the IRB is permitted by federal regulations to grant a waiver of authorization.<br>
<br>
<strong><em>Public Health<br>
</em></strong>We may disclose health information about you for public health activities. These activities may include disclosures:�</p>
<ul>
    <li>�To a public health authority authorized by law to collect or receive such information for the purpose of preventing or controlling disease, injury, or disability;� </li>
    <li>To appropriate authorities authorized to receive reports of abuse and neglect;� </li>
    <li>To FDA-regulated entities for purposes of monitoring or reporting the quality, safety or effectiveness of FDA-regulated products; or </li>

<br>
<b><i>Threats to Health or Safety<br>
</i></b>Under certain circumstances, we may use or disclose your health information� if we believe it is necessary to avert or lessen a serious threat to health and safety and is to a person reasonably able to prevent or lessen the threat or is necessary for law enforcement authorities to identify or apprehend an individual involved in a crime.<br>
<br>
<b><i>Specialized Government Functions<br>
