**ONLINE SECURITY**

Universal Store Pty Ltd utilises a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information. All user contact information is contained behind a "firewall" and only accessible by a limited number of employees who have special access rights to production systems. 

Credit card numbers are not stored in our systems in accordance with the highest of [PCI-DSS standards](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/). When purchasing from Universal Store Pty Ltd your financial details are passed through to a secure server using the latest 256-bit SSL (secure sockets layer) encryption technology.

If you choose to modify your personal information or you have forgotten your password, you may do so by visiting the My Account page.

**SURVEYS**

We may run online surveys and ask visitors for their email address and demographic information. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor your experience at our site, showing you content and promotional offers that we think you might be interested in, and displaying the content according to your preferences. This information is shared with advertisers only on an aggregate basis. We may use contact data from our surveys to send the user information about our company and promotional material from Universal Store Pty Ltd or some of our partners. Users may opt out of receiving future mailings.

**COMPETITIONS**

We run competitions from time to time on our site in which we ask visitors for member ID and password. We use contact data from our contests to send users information about upcoming contests and promotional offers. On occasion we will email customers promotional material from some of our partners. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary for winner notification and prize delivery confirmation. 

The majority of the contests that we offer are hosted on the Universal Store Pty Ltd server; however, there may be cases in which a third party sponsor like a supplier will host the contest and collect user information. In those cases, we urge users to review the privacy statement of the third party site. Users may opt out of receiving future mailings.

Universal Store Pty Ltd only sells product from licenced dealers so you can trust you are receiving the real deal.
