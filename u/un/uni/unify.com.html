<h2>What Personal Information Does Unify Corporation Collect?</h2>
<p>Personal Information is information that can be used to identify or contact a specific individual, such as a name, address, telephone number or email address. Unify may collect certain personal information from customers, business partners, employees and candidates for employment.

Personal information collected online may be combined with information you provide to Unify through other sources such as trade shows or seminars.</p>
<p>Some of Unify’s websites make on-line newsgroups available to our users. Any information that is disclosed in these newsgroups becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. Unify may, from time to time, send email regarding its products and services to users who have posted to our newsgroups. Each participant's opinion expressed in a newsgroup is his or her own and should not be considered as reflecting the opinion of Unify.</p>
<p>To the extent that Unify uses personal information to email you about our product and services, Unify’s email&nbsp;practices are in compliance with the U.S. and E.U.

Service providers and suppliers are required to keep confidential the personal information received from Unify and may not use it for any purpose other than as originally intended.</p> 
<p>We may also share your information with a distributor or partner in your area who can assist with your request for information if Unify does not have its own sales force in your area. The distributor or partner may use these details to contact you about the services that they may offer as well as other Unify products or services that you may be interested in. If you do not want to receive information from our distributors or partners, you may opt out by following the procedures set forth in the Choice/Opt-Out Section of this policy.</p>

In addition, sensitive information will not be used for a purpose other than its original purpose without the employee's approval. Further, Unify will treat as sensitive any information received from a third party where the third party treats and identifies the information as sensitive.</p> 

<h2>Access To and Accuracy of your Information</h2>
