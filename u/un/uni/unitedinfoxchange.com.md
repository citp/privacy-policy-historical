# Ideal Health Overview

  
At Ideal Health, we believe that understanding what our customers want for products, services and information is an important part of building an interesting and useful online environment. 

When you place an order with Ideal Health, your order information may be shared with your assigned Marketing Representative, receiving credit for your order. Your Representative will receive your name, address, phone number and e-mail address, along with a summation of your Order. Ideal Health will not provide your information to any third party company without your prior consent. We have restricted our Marketing Representative from using your personal information in any way other than to provide you with more information about products & services that Ideal Health offers. 

Any information that is sent to Metametrix® Clinical Laboratory, is also held in confidence as well, and IS NOT shared with your Marketing Representative. Any personal information you provide us with, or that is gathered from testing performed, will be used solely to determine your test results, as described in our literature. The tests and analysis SHALL NOT be used to detect the presence of any disease, health condition, drug or other substance. **Absolutely no information will be given to third parties.**

## Research

Information gathered through testing and/or from responses on your Personal Lab Forms, Questionnaires will be held in strictest confidence by Ideal Health, Inc. By your participation in our programs, however, you acknowledge that your anonymous test results and/or lab form information will become part of our cumulative database, which is subject to periodic scientific statistical analyses. These analyses may be included as clinical trial/study data in research papers written for the purposes of publication in mainstream scientific journals. No personal identifying information will ever be disclosed. 

## About our privacy practices

We may use information gathered during your visit to help customize our communications with you. For instance, if you choose to buy PrivaTest Kit, we might offer you a link to a related product the next time you visit us online, or we might send you a brochure about a product that we think you may be interested in, with your AutoShip package. 

In the end, we hope to tailor our communications with you to fit your needs – so that you receive more of what you want from us and less of what you don't want.
