This is information that is not collected in order to identify the relevant user, although - by processing and assigning the data of third parties - based on the nature of the data it would be possible (e.g. IP address, domain name of the computer used to visit the site). These data are used solely to obtain anonymous, statistical information about visits to the site and whether it is functioning correctly. The data could be used, in the event of damage being caused deliberately to the site, to determine the initiator, and would be saved in this case. These data will not be forwarded or disseminated; if requested, they must be made available to the postal police, the court authorities and the judicial police. Navigation data may be used to determine liability in cases of IT offences to the disadvantage of the unibz website.

WordPress is a system that unibz makes available to some of its members to autonomously manage websites that are independent of the official one on which this text is written. WordPress users can be members of the Press and Event Management Office, lecturers, researchers or PhD students of unibz (hereinafter referred to as "User/s"). Visitors of such websites may be people who connect to them through the Internet (hereinafter referred to as Visitors).  
By its very nature, a website based on WordPress can also be used as a "blog", which is defined as a set of articles, possibly written by different users, ordered chronologically and/or according to arbitrary categories. Articles provide for the possibility of being commented by visitors, as well as by the users themselves; comments, in turn, may include the response of other visitors and this can lead to interesting discussions about the article's content.  
The data that users are required to submit when registering are limited to the email address and are mandatory in order to obtain a valid account. When a comment is published, however, in addition to the email address, a visitor is also required to enter his or her name and surname.  
Opinions and comments published by users and visitors and the information contained therein will not be used for any other purpose than being published. In particular, this data will not be aggregated or selected by any other kind of database except WordPress itself. Any statistical processing that the user may intend to carry out in the future will be performed exclusively on an anonymous basis.  
The dissemination of personal data of users and visitors is directly attributable to the initiative of the individual user/visitor, we guarantee that no further communictaion or dissemination of the data is intended. In any case, the user or the visitor may at any time exercise the rights guaranteed by Articles. 15 ff. GDPR and send an email to [privacy@unibz.it](mailto:privacy@unibz.it).  
If users use WordPress to collect any other kind of data subject to EU Regulation n.2016/679, the user will be held personally responsible for the collection and processing of the same, and has to inform visitors and collect their consent in accordance with all applicable laws, and ensure them any right expressly provided by the current legislation.

Personal data shall only be retained for the time that is absolutely essential for the fulfilment of the above mentioned purposes and compliance with the associated statutory requirements. Once this period has elapsed, the data shall be destroyed or anonymised.

#### 9\. Existence of automated decision-making

No decision-making takes place based solely on the automated processing of personal data that could produce an adverse legal effect on the data subject or have a similarly significant negative impact upon them.

The data subject has the right to access their personal data, to have that data corrected or deleted, the right to limit its processing, the right of objection, the right to data transmission, to complain to the responsible national regulatory authority ( Garante della Privacy: [www.garanteprivacy.it](http://www.garanteprivacy.it/web/guest/home_en)), provided that an infringement in the processing of personal data is suspected, plus all other rights recognised by the prevailing statutes (Articles 15 et seq GDPR). If approval has been granted for the processing of personal data, then the data subject has the right to withdraw this approval.  
The aforementioned rights may be exercised by contacting [privacy@unibz.it](mailto:privacy@unibz.it).
