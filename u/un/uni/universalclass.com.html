<strong>Universal Class, Inc. takes your

Privacy Policy: <p></p>


<p>Because we want to provide you with
the most efficient, enhanced, and secured service, we may request information
about you. This Privacy Policy outlines your privacy rights for using
UniversalClass service and lets you know how we ("UniversalClass") collect, use, store and otherwise share information you have provided
us in order to use our services. </p>
<p>This Privacy Policy in conjunction
with our Terms of service as well as any other agreements or policies provided
by UniversalClass governs your use of our services.</p>
<p>If you do not agree with this
Privacy Policy, our Terms of Service, or any other agreements or policy that
governs use of our service, you should not use any of our services. </p>
<p><strong>About this Privacy Policy</strong> </p>
<ul type="disc">
     <li>This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally
     identifiable information that we collect when you are anywhere on our sites,
     and when you use any of our services. </li>
     <li>This policy does not apply to the practices of
     companies, schools, or other organizations that we not own or control, or
     to people that we do not manage or employ. UniversalClass contains several
     links to other sites and we are not responsible for the privacy practices
     or the content of those sites. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Summary of Information We Collect and Track </strong></p>
<ul type="disc">
     <li><strong>General Usage Information</strong>. UniversalClass collects information about all users
     collectively, such as what areas users visit and what services members
     use. This data is automatically retrieved. This type of general
     information is not used to identify specific users, but in an aggregate
     form to help us analyze traffic patterns and enhance our service to better
     serve our users and advertisers. </li>
     <li><strong>UniversalClass Member Registration</strong>. When you register on any site or service provided by
     UniversalClass, we ask for personal information from you such as a
     username, first name, last name, email address, password, country and
     other related information. This information is required in order to
     provide a course to you as well as secure and store your course progress
     and potential course completion. When you log in to our services with your
     username and password (that identifies your registration data), you are
     not anonymous to us. Both General Usage Information and any personal
     details you provide to us is used to enhance and customize content,
     identify (and in some cases validate) you when you post or share content,
     participate in a class, or access any of our member-privileged services. </li>
     <li><strong>Creating, Joining, Taking, or Using our Virtual
     Classroom Environment</strong>. When you
     create, join, take, or use our Virtual Classroom Environment, you are not
     anonymous to us, the instructor(s) within the class, or the student(s)
     within the class you have enrolled. Personally and identifiable
     information about you such as your UniversalClass username, your first and
     last name, and your email address is made available to our staff,
     instructors, proctors and other course facilitators in order to both help
     and assess your course progress. This information is used to better
     enhance your online education experience and to promote free and open
     inquiry as well as to hold class participants personally responsible for
     their work and behavior within the online class. You do have the option of
     sharing your course work and other identifiable information about yourself
     to fellow course participants. Should you choose to do this, we are <strong>not
     responsible</strong> of how fellow class participants decide to use this
     information about you. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

     cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other
     websites. We may use cookies to help identify you when you visit our site. All
     of our member-privileged services require the use of cookies. While you may opt

     when using our service.</li>

customer data connected with it is sold or transferred, in which case we would
require the buyer or transferee to treat any Personal Data in accordance with
this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p>Personal Data may also be disclosed
to a third party if required by applicable law, court order, or government
regulation, or if such disclosure is otherwise necessary in support of any
criminal or other legal investigation or proceeding. </p>
