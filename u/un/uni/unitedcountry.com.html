      PRIVACY STATEMENT</b><font face="Times New Roman"><p align="left"></p>
</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>
</b></font>
<p align="left">At United Country Real Estate (“United Country”) we are fully committed to 
the protection and security of the information provided to us by you, our 
clients, and others who use our Web site. We want you to be comfortable and 
confident about your privacy, so you can enjoy participating in our online 
offerings and so that we can better serve your needs.</p>
<font face="Times New Roman">
<p align="left">Our Privacy Statement discloses what you will want to know about our approach 
to privacy and how your personal information is collected and used. Your use of 
our Web site constitutes your acceptance of this Privacy Statement and your 
consent to the practices it describes.</p>

<p align="left">What information we collect.</p>
</b>
<p align="left">Generally speaking, our Web site is informational. Your “personally 
identifiable information”, that is, information about you as an individual which 
would permit someone to contact you, is only requested in order for us to send 
you information such as our catalog, free bulletins and reports, to enable us to 
search for real estate properties meeting your search criteria, or to begin the 
process of listing your property for sale. We do not collect any personally 
identifiable information unless you voluntarily provide it.</p>
<p align="left">As is the case when you visit most Web sites, to administer our site, your 
visit triggers the automatic logging of certain anonymous information about your 
computer system such as the type of browser you use, the server name and your 
“IP” (Internet Protocol) address. (When your web browser or email application 
requests a web page or email from another computer using the Internet, it 
automatically gives that computer your computer’s “address” so it knows where it 
should send the information. This is called your computer’s “IP address.”) This 
anonymous information does not contain any personally identifiable information 
about you.</p>
<b>
<p align="left">We protect your information.</p>
</b>
<p align="left">We protect the confidentiality and security of your personal information by 
using industry-recognized security safeguards such as firewalls, coupled with 
carefully developed security procedures to protect your information from loss, 
misuse or unauthorized alteration.</p>
<p align="left">Our employees are trained and required to safeguard your information and, 
using physical, electronic and procedural safeguards, we restrict access to 
personal information to those employees and agents for business purposes only. 
Additionally, we use internal and external resources to frequently review the 
adequacy of our security procedures. You need to know, however, that due to the 
open communication nature of the Internet we cannot guarantee that communication 
between you and us, and between us and you, will be free from unauthorized 
access by third parties nor can we be responsible for information stolen from 
our servers by information harvesting software which may have the ability to 
scrape data.</p>
      <b>
<p align="left">We tell you how we intend to use your information.</p>
</b>
<p align="left">When we ask you for information, we tell you, or it will be clear, what we 
need to fulfill your request and how we use it.</p>
<b>
<p align="left">We do not sell or rent your personal information.</p>
</b>
<p align="left">Aside from our own real estate affiliates, we do not share your personal 
information with third parties for promotional use without your consent. You 
control what marketing information you receive from us.</p>
<p align="left">We may, however, have to disclose, transfer, sell or assign your information 
obtained through this Web site, or otherwise in our possession, to a third party 
as a result of a sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of 
substantial assets, reorganization or liquidation of United Country. We may also 
have to make information obtained through this Web site, or otherwise in our 
possession, available to law enforcement personnel and agencies when requested 
to do so or as required by law.</p>
<b>
<p align="left">We want to only provide you information you want.</p>
</b>
</font><p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">At any time, you can let us know whether or not you want to continue to 
receive information from us about our products or services or updated 
information about properties. If you do not wish to receive such material, you 
can specify your preference by emailing us at
