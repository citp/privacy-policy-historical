Non-PII, and in most instances, Website Usage Information (as defined below), by themselves, do not personally identify you or allow you to be personally contacted, but they can be combined with other information in a way that allows you to be identified or personally contacted.

### Automatic Information Collection Technologies and Website Usage Information

We and our service providers automatically collect "Website Usage Information" from or about you, such as information about your computer or mobile device, IP address, web browser, computer or device platform, related software and settings you are using, browsing actions and patterns, the referring page that linked you to us and the website you visit after this Website, and other usage activity on this Website. Collection of Website Usage Information helps us to improve this Website and to deliver a better and more personalized service by enabling us to, among other things: (1) estimate our audience size and usage patterns; (2) store information about your preferences, allowing us to customize this Website according to your individual interests; (3) speed up your searches; and (4) recognize you when you return to this Website.

The automatic collection technologies we and our service providers may use for this automatic information collection include:

  * **Cookies (or browser cookies).** A cookie is a small data file that is sent to your browser or related software and stored on your computer's hard drive when you visit a website. Generally, cookies can track what you look at and where you travel on websites and what transactions you make. They can also store Personal Information about you, including your username and password. A "session cookie" expires immediately when you end your browsing session with the particular website. A "persistent cookie" stores information on your hard drive so when you end your browsing session and return to the same website later, the cookie information is still available. This Website may use both types of cookies. 

  * **Flash Cookies.** Certain features of this Website may use locally stored objects (or Flash cookies) to collect and store information about your preferences and navigation to, from and on this Website. 

  * **Web Beacons.** Pages of this Website and any e-mails we send to you may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) that permit us, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened our e-mails and for other related website analytics (e.g., recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity).

### Third Party Advertisers and Interest-Based Ads

With the exception of certain of our webpages, services or features that may collect sensitive Personal Information such as financial information, we may permit third party advertising companies or ad networks to display third party advertisements on our websites and/or automatically collect Website Usage Information from our websites for purposes of determining your preferences and delivering interest-based advertising and content to you, whether for our products or services or other companies' products or services. 

These third party advertisers may combine the Website Usage Information with Personal Information you directly submit to them or that they receive from other sources, or the Website Usage Information they collect may include information that could allow someone to specifically contact you online without necessarily knowing your identity. We do not have access to or control over the automatic collection technologies that these third party advertisers may use, and the information practices of these third party advertisers are subject to these parties' respective privacy policies, not this Privacy Notice. 

You may want to receive interest-based ads for several reasons. Interest-based ads are helpful because they are more likely to be tailored to your particular interests. They are also more likely to help you discover new products and services that are actually relevant to you and your interests. Also if interest-based tracking is enabled, you likely will not see the same ads over and over because the number of times you see a particular interest-based ad is usually limited. By opting-out of interest-based ads, you lose all of these benefits. If you would like more information about opting-out of interest-based ads or would like to opt-out, see the Choices about How We Use and Disclose Your Information section or visit the opt-out pages of the [Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI")](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) and [Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA")](http://www.aboutads.info/choices). We follow the DAA's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.

  * With any person who, in our reasonable judgment, is authorized to receive your information, such as your agent, attorney, parent, legal guardian, or co-signor of a loan application.

  * We may disclose information we collect from or about you when we believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law, to enforce or apply applicable terms and conditions and other agreements, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of our company, our affiliates, our other customers or users of this Website, or others.

  * If some or all of our business assets are sold or transferred, whether through a sale, acquisition, merger, consolidation, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other corporate change involving us and/or our affiliates, we may transfer the corresponding information regarding our customers and users of this Website, including Personal Information.

### Your Choices About Use and Disclosure of Your Information

We strive to provide you with choices regarding the Personal Information you provide to us. Below are some mechanisms that provide you with control over your information:

* **Promotional E-mails.** If you do not wish to receive promotional e-mails from us, including our e-newsletters, contact us at [privacy@unigogroup.com](mailto:privacy@unigogroup.com) to opt-out or follow the unsubscribe process at the bottom of the promotional e-mail. Note that even if you opt-out, you may still receive transactional e-mails from us (e.g., e-mails related to the completion of your registration, correction of user data, password reset requests, reminder e-mails that you have requested, and any other similar communications essential to your transactions on or made through this Website). 

* **Telephone Calls.** If you do not wish to receive promotional telephone calls, contact us at [privacy@unigogroup.com](mailto:privacy@unigogroup.com) to opt-out. This opt-out does not apply to any informational telephone calls. 

* **Automatic Information Collection Technologies and Advertising.** Our systems currently recognize "do not track" signals from your browser. In addition, the "help" function of your browser should contain instructions on how to set your browser to not accept new cookies, to notify you when a cookie is issued, or how to disable cookies altogether. If Flash cookies are used on this Website, you can manage your Flash cookie settings, by visiting the [Flash player settings page](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html) on Adobe's website. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this Website may be inaccessible or not function properly.

* **Third Party Interest-Based Ads.** We do not control third parties' collection or use of your information to serve interest-based ads. However, you can opt-out of receiving interest-based ads from third party advertisers and ad networks who are members of the NAI or who follow the DAA's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising by visiting the [NAI](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) and [DAA](http://www.aboutads.info/choices) websites. If you opt-out, you may still see contextual advertising from us, meaning you may still see personalized recommendations about our products and services and other similar features on this Website. You may also still see ads provided by us or others on other third party websites; they just will not be based on your particular interests. Also note that your opt-out will be managed through the use of cookies, so if you delete these cookies or use a different browser or computer, you will have to make this same election again.

* **Disclosure of Your Information for Third-Party Advertising.** If you do not want us to share your Personal Information with non-affiliated third parties for promotional purposes (i.e., do not opt-out) concerning such information sharing on this Website's registration page contact us at [privacy@unigogroup.com](mailto:privacy@unigogroup.com) to opt-out. You can also always opt-out by logging into this Website and adjusting your user preferences in your account profile by checking or unchecking the relevant boxes. However, any subsequent opt-out request will only apply from the date of your request, and we will not be responsible for any communications that you may receive from third parties who received your Personal Information prior to your request. In these cases, please contact the third parties directly.
