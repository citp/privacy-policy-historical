The Univerteam site may be viewed without having to reveal any personal

By registering in the Univerteam site the user provides personal information
necessary for the registration, such as, name, address, email address, telephone, etc.

Commission (CNPD). The information is intended for Univerteam service
management and interaction with the affiliates.
Univerteam guarantees the registered affiliate the possibility to access his personal
information through his/her “back office” and to review and correct information.
