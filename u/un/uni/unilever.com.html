          </h2>
						<p>Unilever takes privacy seriously. The following five principles underpin our approach to respecting your privacy:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>We value the trust that you place in us by giving us your personal information. We will always use your personal information in a way that is fair and worthy of that trust.</li>
							<li>We will provide clear information about how we use your personal information. We shall always be transparent with you about what information we collect, what we do with it, with whom we share it and who you should contact if you have any concerns.</li>
							<li>We will take all reasonable steps to protect your information from misuse and keep it secure.</li>
							<li>We will comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations and we will co-operate with data protection authorities.&nbsp; In the absence of data protection legislation, we will act in accordance with generally accepted principles governing data protection.
<br></li>
						</ol>
						<h2 align="center"><u>UNILEVER PRIVACY NOTICE</u></h2>
						<p><em>Last Updated: June 2014</em></p>
						<p>This Privacy Notice explains the types of personal information we collect and how we use, disclose and protect that information.</p>
						<h2 class="title">What does this Privacy Notice apply to?</h2>
						<div class="desc" style="display: none;">
							<p>This Privacy Notice applies to personal information collected by the Unilever Group of companies in connection with the services they offer. Find out more about the Unilever Group at <a href="http://unilever.com/aboutus/">http://unilever.com/aboutus/</a>. This includes information collected offline through our Consumer Engagement Centres, direct marketing campaigns, sweepstakes and competitions, and online through our websites, applications and branded pages on third party platforms and applications accessed or used through such websites or third party platforms (“<strong>Unilever Sites</strong>”).&nbsp;</p>
							<p>This Privacy Notice also applies to targeted Unilever content, including offers and advertisements for Unilever products and services, which we (or a service provider acting on our behalf) may send to you on third party websites, platforms and applications (<strong>“Third Party Sites”</strong>) based on your Site Usage Information (as defined below).&nbsp; These Third Party Sites may have their own privacy policies and terms and conditions. We encourage you to read them before using those Third Party Sites.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br></p>
							<p>This Privacy Notice is hereby incorporated into and forms part of the terms and conditions of use of the applicable Unilever Site.&nbsp; For information about the Unilever Group company responsible for protecting your personal information, see <a class="readMore" href="#rights"><strong>Your privacy rights and who to contact</strong></a> below.
<br></p>
						</div>
						<h2 class="title">Your consent</h2>
						<div class="desc" style="display: none;">
							<p>By using a Unilever Site, you are consenting to the relevant Unilever Group company collecting, using and disclosing your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Notice. If you do not agree to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in this way, please do not use the Unilever Sites or otherwise provide the relevant Unilever Group company with your personal information.</p>
							<p><br>
Unilever will only collect, use or disclose your personal information where it is fair and lawful to do so.&nbsp; In most cases, we will ask for your consent explicitly but, in some cases, we may infer consent from your actions and behaviour.&nbsp; We may ask you to provide additional consent if we need to use your personal information for purposes not covered by this Privacy Notice.&nbsp; You are not obliged to provide such consent but if you decide not to then your participation in certain activities may be restricted.&nbsp; If you provide additional consent, the terms of that consent shall prevail in the event of any conflict with the terms of this Privacy Notice.&nbsp;</p>
							<p><br>
Please note, however, that we may process your personal information without consent if we have a legitimate reason to do so, provided that such use will not have a prejudicial effect on your own rights, freedoms and interests.&nbsp; Any such use shall be in accordance with the Unilever Privacy Principles set out above.&nbsp;
<br></p>
						</div>
						<h2 class="title">Children</h2>
						<div class="desc" style="display: none;">
							<p>The majority of Unilever Sites are designed and intended for use by adults. Where a Unilever Site is intended for use by a younger audience, we will obtain consent from a parent or guardian before we collect personal information where we feel it is appropriate to do so or where it is required by applicable laws and regulations (the age at which consent is necessary varies from country to country).&nbsp; If you are a child over the age where parental consent is required in your country, you should review the terms of this Privacy Notice with your parent or guardian to make sure you understand and accept them.
<br>
If we discover that we have collected information from a child without consent from a parent or guardian where such consent should have been obtained, we will delete that information as soon as possible.
<br>
Access to certain parts of the Unilever Sites and/or eligibility to receive prizes, samples or other rewards may be limited to users over a certain age. We may use your personal information to carry out age verification checks and enforce any such age restrictions.</p>
						</div>
						<h2 class="title">What information do we collect?</h2>
						<div class="desc" style="display: none;">
							<p>In this Privacy Notice, your "personal information" means information or pieces of information that could allow you to be identified. This typically includes information such as your name, address, screen name, profile picture, email address, and telephone number, but can also include other information such as IP address, shopping habits, information about your lifestyle or preferences such as your hobbies and interests. We may collect personal information about you from different sources, including:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<div><a href="#OLE_LINK4">Information you give us directly</a>
										<div class="nestedContent" style="display: none;">
											<p>We may collect information from you directly when you provide us with personal information, e.g. when you register for prize draws or competitions, sign up to receive information, use applications, buy a product or service from us, fill out a survey, or make a comment or enquiry. The types of information we may collect from you directly include your:</p>
											<ul class="listing">
												<li>name</li>
												<li>address</li>
												<li>email address</li>
												<li>user name</li>
												<li>telephone number</li>
												<li>credit card or other payment information</li>
												<li>age</li>
												<li>date of birth</li>
												<li>gender</li>
												<li>user-generated content, posts and other content you submit to Unilever Sites</li>
												<li>any other personal information you voluntarily provide to us
<br></li>

									</div>
								</li>
								<li>
									<div><a href="#OLE_LINK4">Information we collect automatically when you use the Unilever Sites</a>
										<div class="nestedContent" style="display: none;">
											<p>We (and third party service providers acting on our behalf) use cookies and other tools (such as web analytic tools and pixel tags) to automatically collect information about you when you use Unilever Sites, subject to the terms of this Privacy Notice and applicable data laws and regulations.&nbsp; The types of information collected automatically may include:</p>
											<ul class="listing">

												<li>the websites you visited before arriving at a Unilever Site</li>
											</ul>
										</div>
									</div>
								</li>
								<li><a href="#OLE_LINK4">Information we collect from other sources</a>
									<div class="nestedContent" style="display: none;">
										<p>We may receive personal information about you from other legitimate sources, including information from commercially available sources, such as public databases and data aggregators, and information from third parties. The types of personal information that we may collect from such sources include your:</p>
										<ul class="listing">
											<li>name</li>
											<li>street address</li>
											<li>age</li>
											<li>your shopping habits</li>
											<li>preferences and information about your lifestyle such as your hobbies and interests</li>
											<li>publicly available information such as user-generated content, blogs and postings, as permitted by law</li>
										</ul>
										<p><br></p>
										<ul class="listing">
											<li>Online advertising</li>
										</ul>
										<p>We may share Site Usage Information with trusted third parties (e.g. advertisers, advertising agencies, advertising networks, data exchanges, etc.) in order to offer you tailored content, including more relevant advertising for products and services which may be of interest to you.&nbsp; These third parties may set and access their own cookies, web beacons and similar tracking technologies on your device in order to help us deliver customized content and advertising to you when you visit Unilever Sites or Third Party Sites.
<br>
											<br>
In some countries, we have adopted the use of industry-recognised icons (e.g. the AdChoices icon) which may appear alongside targeted advertisements that we (or a service provider acting on our behalf) send to you based on your Site Usage Information.&nbsp; You may click on these icons to receive more information about the collection and use of your information or to opt-out of such collection in future.&nbsp; Please note that even if you opt out, you may still receive advertisements from Unilever that are not customized based on your Site Usage Information.
<br>
											<br>
Depending on your location, there may be other solutions to help you control your online behavioural advertising preferences (such as whether certain third parties may collect and use your Site Usage Information for targeted advertising purposes).&nbsp; For example, in Europe the website <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com">www.youronlinechoices.com</a> allows you to choose which companies can deliver customized ads while in the US you may use the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">Network Advertising Initiative’s Opt-Out Tool</a> and the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">Digital Advertising Alliance’s Opt-Out Tool</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
