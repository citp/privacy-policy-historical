**Uniquepeek Privacy Policy**

**LAST UPDATED: 03/12/2006**

Protecting the privacy of all of our users **("Users", "you" or "your")** is a dedicated commitment of Uniquepeek.com and all of the services brought to you by Uniquepeek.com (collectively, **"Uniquepeek"** , **"us"** or **"we"** ). This Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy"), applies to all URLs and services provided under the Uniquepeek name and in connection with the Uniquepeek marks. It explains how Uniquepeek treats personal information that we collect and receive on the Uniquepeek website from our users and visitors. 

Personal information is information about you that is not otherwise available to the public. As the words imply, this information personally identifies you. Personal information may include, but is not limited to, your name, location, e-mail address, birth date, or other identifying information. 

You should be aware that this Privacy Policy applies ONLY to the Uniquepeek website, the Uniquepeek URLs, and the services and features provided by Uniquepeek. This Privacy Policy does not apply to websites that you visit before or after us, to the other third party services featured on the Uniquepeek site, or to third party advertisers or affiliates (collectively, "Third Party Services"). Please be sure to familiarize yourself with all of these Third Party Services’ privacy policies. For your convenience ONLY, we have listed links to third party privacy policies for some of the parties that we do business with. However, not all Third Party Services may be listed. 

Now that you know what this Privacy Policy covers, you may have the following questions: 

_**WHAT INFORMATION DOES UNIQUEPEEK COLLECT?**_

First and foremost, we DO NOT intentionally collect information from children under the age of 13. We realize that the reach of Uniquepeek may be broad and we have taken steps to ensure the safety of our users or visitors. 

General User Registration: When you register to become a general member ("General Member") of a Uniquepeek, we collect certain information about you. This information is your desired username, and e-mail address as well as optional information such as date of birth, location, and instant messaging handles (collectively, "General Membership Information"). In addition, from time to time, we may collect survey responses or other information regarding our users' interests and preferences. However, you will always have the opportunity to opt out from participating in these surveys. 

Non-Personally Identifiable Information: Uniquepeek also collects non-personally identifiable information about you. Currently, upon registration and video upload, Uniquepeek only collects your IP address, which cannot personally identify you. Uniquepeek also complies user data in the aggregate for purposes of demographic compilations and other data that can help us enhance our user’s experience. 

Contests / Sweepstakes: Some contests, sweepstakes and other promotions that may appear from time to time on Uniquepeek may be sponsored by other companies. These companies may seek to collect personal information from you in order to obtain entry. You can avoid providing your personal information to these companies and sponsors by not participating in these contests, sweepstakes or promotions. In any event, we encourage you to make yourself familiar with the privacy policy specific to any such event prior to your agreement to participate. Uniquepeek will endeavor to conspicuously distinguish Uniquepeek sponsored contests and sweepstakes from that of any third party sponsored contest or sweepstakes. 

_**WHAT IS COLLECTING THE ABOVE INFORMATION?**_

Cookies: Can’t eat these, but Uniquepeek places cookies on your computer to retain your individual preferences and improve your user experience on our website, as well as to tell us what features of our sites are most popular. From time to time, we randomly track what videos and user profiles our users are looking at via client-side cookies. We do this through a randomly generated username only and cannot tie this to your personal data. So in short, we do not store any personal information in cookies, nor do we use cookies to obtain any personal information from you. You can always adjust your web browser’s acceptance of cookies in your browser preferences. 

Also, affiliates and advertisers, product and service providers may also use their own cookies when you interact with their sites via Uniquepeek. You should be aware of this and always consult with their privacy policies. 

Our Database: All of the General Membership Information is stored in our database. Uniquepeek does not use external, file-based or xml storage devises. 

_**HOW DO WE USE GENERAL MEMBERSHIP INFORMATION AND NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?**_

General Membership Information: Uniquepeek will not distribute, sell or rent any of the personal information about you to other people or nonaffiliated companies except to enable the provision of services or products you have requested or when we have your permission to do so. 

Our advertisers will never be privy to your General Membership Information unless you permit us to give it to them so that they can provide you with products or services. 

Your e-mail address may be used by us for communications related to the Uniquepeek services, including but not limited to, sending notices about new features, products, or other information of interest to you. Again, you can always opt out of receiving these notices. 

Non-Personally Identifiable Information: Our advertisers and affiliates may be provided general information or data regarding member usage patterns or interests, or other general demographic information so that they can better serve your needs and preferences. However, such disclosure will not include individually identifiable information.
