# Privacy Policy | University Primetime

Information we receive about you

We receive a number of different types of information about you, including:

Your information – Your information is the information that’s required when you sign up for the site, as well as the information you choose to share.  
Registration information – When you sign up for University Primetime, you are required to provide information such as your real name, email address, birthday, gender, and college or university which you currently attend.  
Information you choose to share – Your information also includes the information you choose to share on University Primetime, such as when you post a status update, upload a photo, or comment on a story. It also includes the information you choose to share when you take an action, such as when you like a Page or a website or add information regarding your school or an event.  
Other information we receive about you

We also receive other types of information about you:

We receive data about you whenever you interact with University Primetime, such as when you search for a school, an event or a page, click on, view or otherwise interact with posts, photos, stories, or events on University Primetime.  
When you post things like photos or videos on University Primetime, we may receive additional related data (or metadata), such as the time, date, and place you took the photo or video.  
We receive data from the computer, mobile phone or other device you use to access University Primetime, including when multiple users log in from the same device. This may include your IP address and other information about things like your Internet Service Provider, location, the type (including identifiers) of browser you use, or the pages you visit.  
The Google Analytics features you’ve implemented based on Display Advertising (e.g., Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration, or Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting).  
Visitors can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using the Ads Settings.  
We only provide data to our advertising partners or customers after we have removed your name or any other personally identifying information from it, or have combined it with other people’s data in a way that it is no longer associated with you.

Public information

When we use the phrase “public information” (which we sometimes refer to as “Everyone information”), we mean the information you choose to make public, as well as information that is always publicly available.  
Information you choose to make public – Choosing to make your information public is exactly what it sounds like: anyone, including people off of University Primetime, will be able to see it. Choosing to make your information public also means that this information:  
can be associated with you (i.e., your name, profile pictures, cover photos, User ID, username, etc.) even off University Primetime;

can show up when someone does a search on University Primetime or on a public search engine;

will be accessible to the University Primetime-integrated games, applications, and websites you and your friends use; and

Sometimes you will not be able to select an audience when you post something (like when you post or comment on an article or story that uses our comments plugin). This is because some types of stories are always public stories. As a general rule, you should assume that if you do not see a sharing icon, the information will be publicly available.  
Information that is always publicly available – The types of information listed below are always publicly available, and are treated just like information you decided to make public:  
Username and User ID – Your user ID will be public information. By registering to use the site, you agree and consent that this information will be public. We also use your User ID to identify your University Primetime account.

Gender – This allows us to refer to you properly.

How we use the information we receive

We use the information we receive about you in connection with the services and features we provide to you and other users like your friends, our partners, the advertisers that purchase ads on the site, and the developers that build the games, applications, and websites you will be able to use through University Primetime. For example, in addition to helping people see and find things that you do and share, we may use the information we receive about you:

As part of our efforts to keep University Primetime products, services and integrations safe and secure;  
To protect University Primetime’s or others’ rights or property;  
To provide you with location features and services, like telling you and your friends when something is going on nearby;  
To measure or understand the effectiveness of ads you and others see, including delivering relevant ads to you.  
For internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research and service improvement.  
Granting us this permission not only allows us to provide University Primetime as it exists today, but it also allows us to provide you with innovative features and services we develop in the future that use the information we receive about you in new ways.

While you are allowing us to use the information we receive about you, you always own all of your information. Your trust is important to us, which is why we don’t share information we receive about you with others unless we have:

Received your permission;  
Given you notice, such as by telling you about it in this policy; or  
Removed your name or any other personally identifying information from it.  
Of course, for information others share about you, they control how it is shared.

We store data for as long as it is necessary to provide products and services to you and others, including those described above. Typically, information associated with your account will be kept until your account is deleted but some information may remain in backup copies and logs for a longer period of time.

Deleting and deactivating your account

If you want to stop using your account, you can either deactivate or delete it.

Deactivate – Deactivating your account puts your account on hold. Other users will no longer see your information, but we do not delete any of your information. Deactivating an account is the same as you telling us not to delete any information because you might want to reactivate your account at some point in the future. You can deactivate your account on your account settings page.  
Deletion – When you delete an account, it is permanently deleted from University Primetime. It typically takes about one month to delete an account, but some information may remain in backup copies and logs for a longer period of time. You should only delete your account if you are sure you never want to reactivate it.  
Certain information is needed to provide you with services, so we only delete this information after you delete your account. Some of the things you do on University Primetime aren’t stored in your account, like posting to a group or sending someone a message (where your friend may still have a message you sent, even after you delete your account). That information remains after you delete your account.
