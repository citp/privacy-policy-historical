					<h1>Unisfair, Inc. Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Unisfair, Inc. values the privacy of our users, members, sponsors, and others (individually or collectively, <strong>“User”</strong> or <strong>“Users”</strong>) that organize, participate in and contribute to virtual events hosted on Unisfair’s proprietary platform (events.unisfair.com), and that otherwise use www.unisfair.com and its associated websites, products, and services (collectively, the <strong>“Service”</strong>).&nbsp; This Privacy Policy details Unisfair’s information-handling practices with respect to information you provide to us or that we learn from your use of the Service and tells you how we may collect, use, and in some instances share this information.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Unisfair <a title="Terms of Use" href="http://events.unisfair.com/terms/TermsOfUse.html">Terms of Use</a>.&nbsp; Your use of the Service and any personal information you provide on the Service are subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the <a href="http://events.unisfair.com/terms/TermsOfUse.html">Terms of Use</a>.</p>
<p>Please note that the Service allows certain third party organizers and contributors to host virtual events (each, a <strong>“Sponsor”</strong>).&nbsp; Unisfair hosts these virtual events and collects the information described below on behalf of such Sponsors.&nbsp; The practices below describe how Unisfair treats your information, BUT YOU SHOULD CONSULT THE PRIVACY POLICIES OF EACH RELEVANT SPONSOR TO DETERMINE HOW THEY MAY HANDLE YOUR INFORMATION.</p>
<h2>The Information Unisfair Collects</h2>
<p><strong>User Provided Information</strong>:  You may provide to Unisfair what is generally called “personally identifiable” information when you register for or use the Service, such as your name, user name, address, company name, telephone number, business contact information, and email address.  Sponsors of virtual events can customize the Service and may thus require additional information.</p>
<p>Please be aware that any information that you choose to share on any publicly available portion of the Service or with third parties, including without limitation your personal page, chat messages, forum posts, blogs, job applications, business cards, or any other information that you provide to Sponsors or other attendees, may be collected and used by others without restriction.  In addition, depending on the type of event, some of the following fields may be displayed throughout the Service: first and last name, company, User ID, and User avatar/image.  The Sponsor may enable attendees to search for and find other attendees based on a User’s registration information.  If you associate your actual name or other personally identifiable information with your User ID, the people to whom you have revealed such information will be able to personally identify your activities on the Service.</p>
<p><strong>“Cookies” Information</strong>: When you access the Service, we may send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your computer.&nbsp; Unisfair may use both session cookies and persistent cookies.&nbsp; A session cookie disappears after you close your browser.&nbsp; A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service.&nbsp; Persistent cookies can be removed.&nbsp; Please review your web browser “Help” file to learn the best way to modify your cookie settings.&nbsp; Please note that disabling cookies may prevent you from accessing some of the functionality available via the Service.</p>
<p><strong>“Automatically Collected” Information</strong>: When you visit the Service or open one of our HTML emails, we may record certain information from your web browser by using different types of technology, including “clear gifs” or “web beacons”.&nbsp; This “automatically collected” information may include your Internet Protocol address (<strong>“IP Address”</strong>), web browser properties, information regarding plug-ins, bandwidth metrics, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after visiting the Service, the pages you view on our site, and the dates and times that you visit.</p>
<p><strong>Payment Information:</strong> When payment is required the payment is processed by PayPal.&nbsp; Unisfair does not collect or process sensitive payment information.</p>
<h2>The Way Unisfair Uses Information</h2>
<p>Unisfair uses the information that we collect to host virtual events on behalf of Sponsors and to provide to you all of the features and services found on the Service.  We will use your email address, without further consent, for non-marketing or administrative purposes such as notifying you of major site updates.</p>
<p>Unisfair may use all of the information that we collect from our Users to understand the usage trends and preferences, to improve the way the Service works and looks, to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, and to create new features and functionality.</p>
<p>Unisfair may use automatically collected information and cookies information to: (a) remember your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you use the Service; (b) provide custom, personalized advertisements, content, and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; and (d) monitor aggregate usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed.</p>
<p>Unisfair will not use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send promotional or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in.</p>
<h2>When Unisfair Discloses Information</h2>
<p>Except as otherwise noted in this Privacy Policy, Unisfair does not share personal information about Users with third parties unless doing so is appropriate to carry out a User’s request or it reasonably believes that doing so is legally required or is in Unisfair’s interest to protect its property or other legal rights or the rights or property of others.</p>
<p>We do not share User information with other third-party organizations for their marketing or promotional use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in.</p>
<p><strong>Important Note Regarding Sponsors</strong>.  Please note that Unisfair hosts the events on behalf of Sponsors, and Sponsors therefore have access to all information collected through the Service.  You should consult the respective privacy policies of these Sponsors to determine how they will handle your information.  Unisfair’s Privacy Policy does not apply to such Sponsors or their use of your information, and we do not control Sponsors’ use of your information.  If you would prefer that Unisfair not disclose your personal information to any such Sponsor, please contact us at privacy@unisfair.com.  Please be reminded, however, that any information that you publicly display or share or that is accessible through the Service may already be in such Sponsors’ possession, despite such opt-out choice.</p>
<p>Unisfair may disclose both personally identifiable and automatically collected information to affiliated companies or other businesses or persons to process such information on our behalf, to provide website maintenance and security, to offer certain features, to assist us in improving the way the Service works and looks, and to create new features. We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with our Privacy Policy, we use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information, and we require these parties to use any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. <strong> </strong></p>
<p>We may share automatically collected and other aggregate non-personally-identifiable information with interested third parties to assist them in understanding usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the Service.</p>
<h2>Access and Your Choices</h2>
<p>You may, of course, decline to share your personally-identifiable information with Unisfair, in which case Unisfair will not be able to provide to you some or all of the features and functionality found on the Service.  You have access to and may update, correct, or delete your information and preferences at any time by going to the Account Settings Section of the Service.  YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THE SECRECY OF YOUR UNIQUE PASSWORD AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION AT ALL TIMES.</p>
<h2>International Users and the U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor</h2>
<p>By accessing the Services of Unisfair and voluntarily providing us  with the requested personally identifiable information Users consent to  the collection and use of the information in accordance with this  Privacy Policy including transfers from the European Economic Area (EEA)  to the United States or elsewhere where privacy protections may not  have been deemed “adequate” by the European Union. Individuals who do  not consent to the collection, use, or disclosure of their personal  information as outlined in this policy should not provide any personally  identifiable information through the Service. If a User has provided  personally identifiable information to Unisfair through the Service, and  no longer consents to its use or disclosure as described in this  policy, please visit the Account Settings Section of the Service.&nbsp;  Note:&nbsp; Deletion of any account information held by Unisfair will not  stop the processing of any such information by event Sponsors on whose  behalf Unisfair has processed such information.&nbsp; You should contact any  such Sponsors directly regarding any such processing.</p>
<p>In accordance with our commitment to protect personal privacy, Unisfair adheres to the principles of the Safe Harbor Framework as developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce in consultation with the European Commission. The seven principles and fifteen Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) referred to in this policy constitute the Safe Harbor privacy framework. These principles and FAQs may be found at: http://www.export.gov/safeharbor.</p>
<h2>Oversight/Enforcement</h2>
<p>Unisfair has a Privacy Officer who is responsible for Unisfair’s compliance with and enforcement of this Policy. Unisfair’s Privacy Officer is available to any of its employees, customers, vendors, business partners, or others who may have questions concerning this Privacy Policy or data security practices. Unisfair’s Privacy Officer may be contacted by email at privacy@unisfair.com.</p>
<p>If you have any concerns over how we store or use your data you can contact us and we’ll do our best to resolve your query. If, for any reason, you are not satisfied with how we deal with your query you can raise a formal dispute through <a title="eTrust" href="http://www.etrust.org">eTrust</a>, they will work impartially to ensure that your query is properly investigated and resolved.</p>
<h2>Children</h2>
<p>Consistent with the federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of thirteen (13) without requiring parental consent, and no part of the Service is directed to persons under 13.  Any person who provides their personal information to Unisfair represents that they are 13 years of age or older.</p>
<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>The Service may contain links to websites and services provided by third parties (including those of Sponsors). Any information you provide on third-party sites or services is provided directly to that third party and is subject to that party’s policies. We are not responsible for the content or practices and policies of third-party sites or services to which links are displayed on the Service. We encourage you to learn about third parties’ privacy and security policies before providing them with any information.<strong> </strong></p>
<h2>Our Commitment to Data Security</h2>
<p>We use secure server software and firewalls to protect your personally identifiable information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.  However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software.</p>
<p>No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk.  Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure security on our systems.</p>
<p>If Unisfair learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Unisfair may post a notice on the Service if a security breach occurs.  Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.  To receive a free written notice of a security breach you should notify us at security-notice@unisfair.com.</p>
<h2>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy.  When we do, we will also revise the “Last Updated” section below.  For changes to this Privacy Policy that may be materially less restrictive on our use or disclosure of personal information that you have provided to us, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain your consent before implementing the change. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about how we are protecting the information we collect.  Your continued use of the Service constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any updates.</p>
<h2>Contacting Unisfair</h2>
<p>If you have any questions, comments, or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at privacy@unisfair.com or write to us at: Privacy Matters — Unisfair, 149 Commonwealth Drive<br>
