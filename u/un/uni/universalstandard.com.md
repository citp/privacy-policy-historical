The types of Personal Information we may collect (directly from you or from Third-Party sources) and our privacy practices depend on the nature of the relationship you have with Universal Standard and the requirements of applicable law. Below are some of the ways that Universal Standard may collect Personal Information:

  * Personal Information may be provided by you directly to Universal Standard through interacting with the Services, making online or in-store purchases, participating in surveys, during events, participating in sweepstakes or giveaways, and requesting Services or information.
  * As you navigate the Services, certain passive information may also be collected about your visit, including through cookies and similar technologies as described below.
  * From third-party sources, including service providers such as Shopify, Paypal, and Google, and through your interactions with us on social media websites.



We aim to collect only information that is relevant for the purposes of Processing. An overview of the ways we collect Personal Information and how we use it are outline below.

### 1\. Types of Personal Information We Collect

Universal Standard collects Personal Information regarding its current, prospective, and former clients, customers, users, visitors, and guests (collectively “Individuals”).

  * #### A. Information You Provide Directly to US.

When you use the Services or engage in certain activities, such as registering for an Account with Universal Standard, making an online or in-store purchase, responding to surveys, entering contests/sweepstakes/giveaways, requesting Services or information, or contacting us directly, we may ask you to provide some or all of the following types of information:

    1. **Making a Purchase with US.** When you make a purchase online or in a Universal Standard showroom, store or pop-up event, we may collect some or all of the following Personal Information, which can be used to identify you, such as your name, company, email address, postal address, phone number, credit card information (not processed or hosted by Universal Standard) and your order history.
    2. **Create an Account.** To create an Account, we’ll collect certain information that can be used to identify you, such as your name, postal address and phone number, as well as other optional information you may provide. If you create an Account using your login credentials from one of your third-party services accounts such as Facebook or Google (each an “Third-Party Account”), we’ll be able to access and collect your name and email address and other Personal Information that your privacy settings on the Third-Party Account permit us to access. If you create an Account through the Site or one of your Social Networking Services (“SNS”) Accounts, we may also collect your gender or date of birth.
    3. **Communications with US.** We may collect Personal Information from you such as name, email address, birthday, phone number or mailing address when you choose to request information about our Services, create an account, subscribe to Universal Standard’s emails/newsletter or a loyalty program that we may offer from time to time, request to receive customer or technical support, provide us with feedback, or otherwise communicate with us.
    4. **Surveys.** From time to time, we may contact you to participate in online surveys. If you do decide to participate, you may be asked to provide certain information which may include Personal Information. All information collected from your participation in our surveys is provided by you voluntarily. We may use such information to improve our products, Site and/or services and in any manner consistent with the policies provided herein.
    5. **Registration for Sweepstakes, Giveaways, Contests and Events.** Occasionally, Universal Standard may run sweepstakes and contests. We ask those who enter in the sweepstakes or contests to provide certain Personal Information, such as contact information (e.g., an email address). If you participate in a sweepstakes or contest, your Personal Information may be used to reach you about the sweepstakes or contest, and for other promotional, marketing and business purposes. In addition, occasionally, we will partner with third parties during events, on social media and online channels to sponsor giveaways and promotions. If you choose to share your information in order to participate in an event, giveaway or promotion, your entry information may be shared with such third parties.
  * #### B. Information Collected Automatically by US: Pixel Tags/Web Beacons, Cookies, Social Media Widgets, Embedded Scripts, Analytics Information, and Other Data Collection.

Universal Standard, as well as Third Parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on our Services, may use pixel tags, cookies, local storage, or other technologies (“Technologies”) to automatically collect information through the Services. We use Technologies that are small data files placed on your electronic device, mobile phone, or other devices (referred to collectively as a "device") that allow us to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with our Site, services, applications, messaging, and tools, and to recognize you across each device. These Technologies include, among others, the following:

    * **Pixel Tags/Web Beacons.** A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded on the website that collects information about users’ engagement on that web page. The use of a pixel allows us to record, for example, that a user has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement.
    * **Cookies.** Cookies are small text files placed in visitors’ computer browsers to store their preferences. Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. However, if you do that, the Site may not work properly.
    * **Social Media.** Our Site may, now or in the future, include social media features such as the Facebook “Like” button and LinkedIn (that might include widgets such as the share this button or other interactive mini-programs). These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Moreover, if you register for or access the Services using a Third Party Account (such as your social media login credentials), we may receive Personal Information that you allow such Third Party Service to share with us. These social media features are either hosted by a Third Party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
    * **Embedded Scripts.** Embedded scripts are programming code designed to collect information about your interactions with the website, such as the links you click. The code maybe temporarily downloaded onto your device from a web server or a third party service provider, and is active only while you are connected to the website.
    * **Analytics.** When you browse or use the Services, we utilize commonly-used logging and analytics tools, including Shopify’s analytics tools and Google Analytics, a service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”), to gather information about how users engage with our Services. For more information about Google Analytics, please visit <https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites>. You can opt out of Google’s collection and processing of data generated by your use of the Services by going to <http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout>.
    * **Other Data Collection.** We may collect certain information automatically through our Services or other methods of web analysis about how users use our Services (we refer to this information as “Event Data”). Event Data may include information such as an user’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, cookie identifiers, MAC address, IMEI, Advertiser ID, and other device identifiers that are automatically assigned to your computer or device when you access the Internet, operating system, browser type and language, hardware type, the web page that a user was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a user browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services that a User clicked on and other statistics.
  * Our uses of such Technologies fall into the following below general categories. If you would like to opt out of the Technologies we employ on our sites, services, applications, or tools, you may do so by blocking, deleting, or disabling them as your browser or device permits. 
    * **Operations-Based Necessity.** We may use cookies, web beacons, or other similar technologies that are necessary to the operation of our site, services, applications, and tools. This includes technologies that allow you access to our Site, services, applications, and tools; that are required to identify irregular site behavior, prevent fraudulent activity and improve security; or that allow you to make use of our functions such as shopping-carts, saved search, or similar functions.
    * **Performance Related.** We may use cookies, web beacons, or other similar technologies to assess the performance of our Site, applications, services, and tools, including as part of our analytic practices to help us understand how our visitors use our Site, determine if you have interacted with our messaging, determine whether you have viewed an item or link, or to improve our website content, applications, services, or tools.
    * **Functionality Related.** We may use cookies, web beacons, or other similar technologies that allow us to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing or using our Site, services, applications, or tools. This may include identifying you when you sign into our sites or keeping track of your specified preferences, interests, or past items viewed so that we may enhance the presentation of content on our sites.
    * **Targeting/Advertising Related.** We may use first-party or third-party cookies and web beacons to deliver content, including ads relevant to your interests, on our sites or on third party sites. This includes using technologies to understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements and content that has been delivered to you, such as whether you have clicked on an advertisement.
  * #### C. Information Provided from Other Users.

If you decide to invite a third party to create an account and/or purchase our merchandise, we will collect the Personal Information you provide (e.g., name and email address) for you and the third party in order to send a message to the third party and follow up with the third party. We rely upon you to obtain whatever consents from the third party that may be required by law to allow us to collect such information and contact the third party as described in the foregoing sentence. You or the third party may contact us at privacy@universalstandard.net to request the removal of this information from our database.

  * #### D. Information Collected from Third Parties.

We may receive personal information from third parties that we have engaged to provide services to us (including payment processors such as PayPal, Stripe, Amazon Pay, shipping platforms such as ShipStation to fulfill orders, and ecommerce platforms such as Shopify) as well as from third parties that provide web analytics and usage information to us (including platforms such as Google Analytics, Heap, and Hotjar, which may change from time to time). In addition, if you choose to interact with us or our partners on social media by posting to our pages, tagging us (or using certain hashtags or other identifiers) in posts, or participating in activities, we may collect certain information from the social media account you use to interact with us, including the name associated with the account, the account handle, recent activity, the content of any posts in which we are tagged, and other information that may be contained on your social media profile to allow us to respond to the posts and engage with our audience.

  * #### A. Information Shared with Our Vendors and Service Providers.

We may engage third-party service providers to work with us to administer and provide the Services. Some of examples of these third-party’s services include payment processing, IT, customer service, handling shipping/returns and in connection with the provision of our Site. These third-party services providers have access to your Personal Information for the purpose of performing services on our behalf.

We may also share such de-identified information as well as selected Personal Information (such as demographic information and past purchase history) we have collected with Third-Party advertising partners. These advertising partners may use this information (and similar information collected from other websites) for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements to you when you visit non-Universal Standard related websites within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as “interest-based advertising” or “online behavioral advertising”. We may allow access to other data collected by the Site to facilitate transmittal of information that may be useful, relevant, valuable or otherwise of interest to you.

  * #### D. Disclosures to Protect Us or Others (e.g., as Required by Law and Similar Disclosures).

Universal Standard may also disclose and transfer your Personal Information: (i) to a subsequent owner, co-owner or operator of the Site or applicable database, or of our products or services; (ii) if Universal Standard (or any of its affiliated, parent, or subsidiary companies) assigns its rights regarding any of your information to a third party; or (iii) in connection with or during negotiation of a corporate merger, financing consolidation, restructuring, the acquisition or dissolution transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets including, without limitation, during the course of any due diligence process. In the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, Personal Information may also be transferred as a business asset. If another company acquires our company, business, or assets, that company will possess the Personal information collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. These transfers and disclosures may be carried out without notice to you.




## G. Opt-Out and Right to Restrict Processing

We offer you choices regarding the collection, use and sharing of your Personal Information, and we’ll respect the choices you make. Please note that if you decide not to provide us with the Personal Information that we request, you may not be able to access all of the features of the Services. You have the right to opt out of certain uses and disclosures of your Personal Information. Where you have consented to Universal Standard’s Processing of your Personal Information, you may withdraw that consent at any time and opt out of further Processing by contacting privacy@universalstandard.net. Even if you opt out, we may still collect and use non-Personal Information regarding your activities on our Sites and/or information from the advertisements on Third-Party websites for non-interest based advertising purposes, such as to determine the effectiveness of the advertisements.

  2. #### 2\. Do Not Track (“DNT”)

DNT is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. Please note that we do not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers.

  3. #### 3\. Cookies and Interest-Based Advertising

You may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or remove them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences. Please note that cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on mobile applications. However, on many mobile devices, application users may opt out of certain mobile ads via their device settings.

The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt out of receiving targeted ads from our data partners and our other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs. You can access these, and also learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy, at [www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp), or <http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/> and [www.aboutads.info/choices/](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). You can also choose not to be included in Google Analytics here: [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout)

Whether you are using our opt-out or an online industry opt-out, cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted out. For example, if you have opted out on your computer browser, that opt out will not be effective on your mobile device. You must separately opt out on each device. Advertisements on Third-Party websites that contain the AdChoices link and that link to this Privacy Policy may have been directed to you based on anonymous, non-Personal Information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites. These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt out of the advertising partners’ use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes.




## H. Rights of Access, Rectification, Erasure, and Restriction

You may inquire as to whether Universal Standard is Processing Personal Information about you, request access to Personal Information, and ask that we correct, amend or delete your Personal Information where it is inaccurate.

If Universal Standard determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, Universal Standard will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your Personal Information.
