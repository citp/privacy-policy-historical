This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within UTA to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area. Our service automatically gathers certain usage information like the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Website and its areas. This is similar to the way television ratings tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program. We only use such data in the aggregate and not on an individual basis. This collective data helps us determine how much our customers use parts of the Website, so we can improve our site to assure that it is as appealing as we can make it for as many of you as possible.</p><p>For example, our Website may use a technology nicknamed "cookies" that tells us how and when pages in our site are visited, and by how many people. UTA cookies <u><strong>do not collect personally identifiable information</strong></u> and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personally identifiable information to tell us who you are or even what your screen name or e-mail address is. We also may provide statistical "ratings" information to our Website’s partners about how our members, collectively not individually, use our Website. We do this so that our partners too can understand how much people use their areas of our Website and our site in order for them to provide you with the best possible Web experience.&nbsp; Such ratings information does not contain any information about you personally.</p><div class="txt-right"><a class="sml-lnk" href="#top">Top</a></div><a name="_toc143851516"></a><h2>Use of Cookies </h2><p>UTA may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p><p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize UTA pages, or register with our Website or for our services, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information on subsequent visits.
