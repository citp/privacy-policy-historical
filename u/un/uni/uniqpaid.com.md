##### OPTING-OUT:

Established members will occasionally receive e-mails containing information regarding new offers or special promotions from UniqPaid if they have not opted out.

##### SITE AND SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS:

Under rare circumstances UniqPaid.com may need to contact specific or all users in order to make an important announcement about the UniqPaid site or service changes. Members are not able to un-subscribe, or "opt-out" of these announcements, because they may contain very important information regarding their accounts. Before these measures are taken, however, UniqPaid will post information regarding changes directly on the web site. UniqPaid.com reserves the right to contact users to correct account errors or to supply important information UniqPaid deems relevant.

##### SPAM:

We will immediately terminate any account which we believe, at our sole discretion, is transmitting or is otherwise connected with any Spam or other unsolicited bulk e-mails and postings. 

We will also pursue severe legal action against members who are involved in SPAM. These may include contacting respective authorities (employers, universities, local law-enforcement, the FBI) as well as asking Internet Service Providers to deny service. 

SPAM includes, but is not limited to, unsolicited e-mails and/or postings in discussion groups, bulletin boards, and other public domain groups. SPAM messages are generally prohibited by most network providers and certain jurisdictions and those users employing them may be subject to fines and/or imprisonment. We do not allow our members to utilize SPAM messages. The company will automatically terminate all spamming accounts.
