### The Way We Use Information:

We use the information we collect on our survey to support better decision-making in our company. We do not accept advertising on our web sites and will absolutely not use your email addresses for any purpose not connected with the management of our services. We use a type of cookie, called a session object, to maintain the connection between pages during the time that you are entering responses to the survey or while you're logged in to your account. We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

### Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

### How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information

You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by a secure login into the members area. If for some reason you cannot login or have lost your password you can use the "lost password" tool. If that process has failed you may then contact us and to protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections. There is a security limit of 1 request per 7 days to protect your privacy.
