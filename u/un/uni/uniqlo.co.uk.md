### How does UNIQLO use the information collected?

We will treat all your Personal Information as confidential (although we reserve the right to disclose this information in the circumstances set out below).   
Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we do not share your information with any third parties other than for the limited, explicit reasons specified below; neither are we in the business of selling it to others. 

We share Personal Information with our parent company and affiliates that either are subject to this Privacy Policy or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice. 

The Personal Information are shared on a limited basis from time to time to send postal mail and e-mail, remove repetitive information from customer lists, analyse data, provide marketing assistance and provide customer service. 

We will only disclose data to: 

  * Other companies within our Group of companies
  * Business partners
  * Suppliers we engage to process data on our behalf
  * Government bodies and law enforcement agencies
  * Successors in title to our business


  * Given that the Internet is a global environment, using it to collect and process personal data necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis.
  * We share Personal Information and User Information with our parent company and affiliates. We share it on a limited basis with agents we use from time to time to send postal mail and e-mail, remove repetitive information from customer lists, analyse data, provide marketing assistance and provide customer service.
  * The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"), although the data will always be held securely and in line with the requirements of UK data protection. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfillment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.
  * We use your Personal Information to carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us and for the specific purpose for which it was volunteered. In addition, if you supply us with your postal address online, you may receive periodic mailings from us with information regarding a new collection, new products, new store locations, or upcoming promotional offers or events.
  * If you do not wish to receive any communications form UNIQLO or otherwise wish to remove your name and Personal Information from our list, please contact us at helpme@uniqlo.eu.



We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions; or protect the rights, property, or safety of the Site, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. However, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personal information for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this policy. 

In the case that UNIQLO, or substantially all of its assets are acquired by one or more third parties as a result of a merger, sale, consolidation or liquidation, customer information may be one of the transferred assets. 

You agree that you do not object to us contacting you for any of the above purposes whether by telephone, e-mail or in writing and you confirm that you do not and will not consider any of the above as being a breach of any of your rights under the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003. 

By using this Site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. We do not sell or rent to other third parties any personal information that you provide to us, except with your consent or as described in this Privacy Policy. 

### Links to third party websites

Certain links within the Site may be to other unrelated third party companies that offer you the option to share your personal information with them. We will not share your Personal Information with those third party companies. 

Links provided on the Site to third party websites are provided as a convenience to you and we do not control those sites or their privacy practices, which may differ from ours. We do not endorse or make any representations about any third party sites that may be accessible through this site. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any company before submitting your personal information. 

The data you choose to give to unrelated third parties is covered by their privacy policies. Some third party companies may choose to share their personal data with us; that sharing is governed by that third party's privacy policy. 

We cannot be responsible for personal data that third parties may collect, store and use through their websites. You should always read the privacy policy of each website you visit carefully. 

How secure is your information? We are committed to offering our customers a safe and secure environment. Our servers utilise SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption technology to help protect your personal information. By using an SSL-compatible browser such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox, you can help ensure that your personal information is processed confidentially. 

In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your Personal Information, in our possession, may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you. If a notification is appropriate or required by law, we would endeavour to do so as promptly as possible, and, to the extent we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail. By using this Site, you consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification.
