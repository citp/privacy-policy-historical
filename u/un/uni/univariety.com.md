## Privacy Policy

### Introduction

Univariety.com is a product of International Education Gateway ('IEG') which is a Singapore based organization (Authroised collection agent for India - College Street Education Technologies Pvt. Ltd.) and believes in the necessity of Global exposure in today's higher education. With offices in Singapore, India and UK currently, IEG strives to work with institutions and students who believe in the power of Global Opportunities. Opportunities come in many shapes and sizes; there can be a large opportunity in accessing the "Best Fitting" university & course for the individual versus just going by some popular names which don't fit the needs. Or say, the face to face interactions at a young age with a learned professor from a foreign country can result in broadening of horizons for the student and result in opening up of many opportunities. At IEG, we believe that many gateways can be opened up if resources are pooled in hence we enable partnerships between like minded institutes around the world.
