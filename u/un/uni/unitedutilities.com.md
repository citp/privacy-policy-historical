**Do we process your data abroad?**

Although we are a UK company, we may sometimes use organisations outside of the UK where we have contractors working on our behalf, and as part of this they may process your personal data. When this is necessary, we will make sure there are adequate security measures in place to protect your personal data through strict contractual arrangements.

**Other processing activities**

**Vulnerable persons** \- in order to provide specific services to vulnerable people we may need to process personal data about you or members of your household with organisations such as Social Services, Public Health England, Law Enforcement Agencies, Local healthcare providers, the Drinking Water Inspectorate, other utility companies and our internal Priority Services teams.

This may include data of a sensitive nature, such as health information (which is known as Special Category or Sensitive Personal Data). We may also share data about your personal circumstances, for example any frailties or relating to a risk of violence. If we need to do this, we will always try to obtain your consent prior to sharing the data, unless it is not possible under the circumstances and it is in your vital interests for us to do so or there is a public health safeguarding interest or issue.

We will only share limited personal data which is proportionate to the need for sharing it.

Should we need to process data about children (those under 16), we will seek consent from an adult with parental responsibility or any appointed guardian.

**Profiling** – we may use certain types of personal data collected to help us understand how we can focus on sending you information which is relevant to you or to your circumstances. For example whether you could benefit from having a water meter or a more manageable payment scheme.

Examples of data we use for profiling include, water consumption, ability to pay and demographic data.

We will seek your explicit consent when you next communicate with us or you can choose to ”opt in” when you log onto the My Account service.

We will only use this data to improve your situation and will not pass on your “profile” to any third parties for the purposes of marketing.

**Marketing** – on occasions we may wish to tell you about products or services we feel would be of benefit or interest to you. These products or services may be provided by us or carefully selected third parties. We may need to share some of your personal data with others in order to do this.

We may need to ask for your consent to share such offers and each time you are contacted with such offers you will be given the opportunity not to receive any more. If you don’t want to be contacted about any offers at all, please contact us by writing to United Utilities, Haweswater House, Lingley Mere Business Park, Lingley Green Avenue, Warrington, WA5 3LP  or please let us know by calling **[0345 075 0715](tel:0345 075 0715 "Call 0345 075 0715").**

If you have agreed to receive marketing, products or services from another company and later decide you no longer want these, please contact that company directly to let them know.
