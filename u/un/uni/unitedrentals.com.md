# United Rentals - Privacy Policy

Protecting your information online is of the utmost importance to United Rentals, Inc. (together with its affiliated companies, "United Rentals"). This Privacy Policy explains how we will and will not use the information you entrust to us through the United Rentals website located at http://www.ur.com, http://www.urdata.ur.com, and http://www.unitedrentals.com (collectively, the "Site"). 

**Protection of Information**  
When you visit our Site, place an order online or email a communication, your data passes through a server maintained by United Rentals. The technology used in this process is designed to prevent someone other than United Rentals from viewing and downloading your information. For more information on this subject, see External Considerations below. 

You can visit our Site as often as you like without registering; however, registration is required to use our E-Rental Store® online facility, and a separate registration is required to access the URdata® section of our Site (available to certain existing account customers). The information you furnish at the time of registration is used by United Rentals to provide you with personalized service and/or to continually improve our Site for the benefit of our customers. 

United Rentals may collect the domain names of all visitors to our Site in order to measure the Site's effectiveness and to determine ongoing improvements. We may also collect the e-mail addresses from emailed messages received. No registration information, domain names or email addresses will be shared with or sold to any other company or individual without prior authorization. We may provide aggregate statistics to reputable parties about the visitors to our Site, but these statistics will not include any personal or private information that identifies you. 

When you initiate a transaction through our E-Rental Store® you may be asked for information that will allow us to properly complete your order. Additionally, United Rentals uses reputable companies to verify credit before billing, and we necessarily share certain information with outside service providers (for example, shipping information with our delivery service providers). We have legally binding agreements with many of our service providers that prohibit them from using customer information for any purpose other than what we instruct them to do with it. 

Additionally, when you visit our Site, a tiny element of data called a "cookie" is automatically sent to your browser and may be stored on your hard drive so that our Site recognizes you when you return. These cookies do not contain any personally identifying information. You may set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie (rather than automatically accept all cookies); however, should you decide not to accept cookies from our Site, you will limit your access to certain benefits provided by the Site. 

United Rentals may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on United Rentals; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of United Rentals; or (3) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of our employees, users of our products or services, or members of the public. 

**Ongoing Communications**  
When registering at our Site, you may be asked whether you would like to receive future communications about United Rentals products and services. If you authorize these communications, but later change your mind, please contact our Privacy Officer (see Contact Us below for details on how to contact our Privacy Officer). 

**External Considerations**  
Our Site may include links to other Internet Sites as a convenience to Site visitors. The inclusion of any link does not imply our endorsement of any other company, its products, services or privacy practices. Furthermore, United Rentals is not responsible for personal information voluntarily disclosed by you to third parties that you reach through links on our Site. 

No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, United Rentals cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted to our Site over the Internet. We do our best, however, to ensure the security of all information that passes through our server. 

United Rentals displays many products on our Site, and offers them for rent and/or for sale. These products are reasonably represented to the best of our ability as to specifications, configuration, design and applications. However, United Rentals does not guarantee that the product representations are accurate in every detail or that each product will be available when and where needed to fulfill a specific request. 

**Children's Policy**  
The content of our Site is appropriate for, but not targeted to, children under the age of thirteen. United Rentals does not market products or services to this age group.
