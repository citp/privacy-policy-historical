# Privacy Policy - Unroll.Me

Last updated on January 11, 2019

Data security and privacy are a priority for Unroll.me, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Slice Technologies, Inc. and its group companies (“Unroll.me” or “we”). This privacy policy describes:

  * the information we collect through our websites, apps and other consumer-facing services (the “Service”);
  * how we use this information;
  * with whom we share it;
  * and how we protect it.



This privacy policy also provides you with information about:

  * how you can request to access, stop the collection of, or delete your personal information (information that can be used to locate or identify you);
  * how to withdraw any consent you previously provided to us; and
  * where to go if you have questions about our privacy practices.



## Information that we collect and how we use it

We collect information from you in several ways. You directly provide us with some information about you, you authorize us to collect other types of information, and we automatically collect certain types of information. As described in the section “How We Protect Your Information,” after we collect your information, we undertake a process that is designed to de-identify this information, and we may further combine or aggregate this information with other information available to us or our trusted business partners. Once the information is processed, we use and/or share this data for research and business purposes, subject to applicable laws.

Information you provide to us: When you register for the Service, you provide us with basic contact information, such as name and email address. You may also provide us with information when you interact with us, such as:

  * when you sign up for email alerts,
  * subscribe to receive information,
  * complete a survey, or
  * seek customer support.



From time to time we will request additional information from you so that we can provide you with a specific offer, function, or feature. We use the information that you provide us to:

  * bring you the Service,
  * allow you to create and manage your account with us,
  * contact you about updates to and offers connected with the Service,
  * provide you with customer service and technical support, and
  * provide you with important notices about the Service.



Information you authorize us to collect: In order for us to perform tasks that are part of the Service, we need to access your email account(s). You authorize this access by agreeing to this privacy policy and providing any consent required by your email provider.

We use this access to:

  * perform the functions of the Service, such as unsubscribing you from unwanted subscriptions and creating a roll-up of other subscriptions;
  * develop and offer new services;
  * tailor content as part of our Service such as in our roll-up summaries; and
  * support our market research business.



Specifically, we access information from transaction-related emails that you receive to develop and prepare market research datasets and analyses with the assistance of and, in combination with data that is available to, our parent company, our affiliate companies, and other trusted business partners. Examples of the transaction-related emails that we or our trusted business partners process include purchase receipts, sales receipts, delivery confirmations and returns, subscription confirmations and cancellations, registration confirmations, transaction summaries and the like. This market research is used by Fortune 500 companies, household name brands, investment companies, and other businesses for purposes such as:

  * understanding industry and business trends;
  * improving the goods, services or offers provided to customers;
  * improving business operations;
  * understanding the competitive landscape; or
  * understanding where to make investments; or 
  * gaining other business insights.



Information that we automatically collect. We may automatically collect information about the way that you use or interact with our Service so that we can:

  * tailor content within our Service, such as in roll-up summaries;
  * provide users with access to our website, app, service, or feature;
  * better understand our users, their interests and preferences; and
  * develop, deliver, and improve the services we offer.



The type of information we collect through automated means include technical details about the devices you use with our Service (such as IP address or other device identifier), usage information and statistics about your interaction with our websites, the URLs of our web pages that you visit, URLs of referring and exiting pages, page views, time spent on a page, number of clicks, platform type, and other information about how you use our Service.

Please note that if there are features of our Services that are provided by third parties, those parties also may use automated means of data collection that are subject to those third parties’ privacy notices and policies.

Here are some of the types of automated data collection that occur when you use our sites:

Web Browsers: When you visit one of our websites, your browser automatically sends us your Internet protocol (“IP”) address so that the web pages you request can be sent to your computer or device. We use your IP address to determine additional information, such as whether the computer or device has ever been used to visit our site before, which site features were used most often, and how much time was spent on a page.

Cookies: We automatically collect information through “cookies,” which are text files placed on your device’s hard drive when you visit websites. Cookies can enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular site. We use cookies to help us manage and understand how you use our website. For example, we use cookies for authentication purposes, to measure session activity on the site, and to determine which areas and features of the site are the most popular. If you wish to disable cookies, you can do so by adjusting the settings for the browser that you use. If you do choose to disable cookies through your browser, you will not able to take full advantage of all our site features.

Web Beacons and Log Files: We may use “web beacons” (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags, tracking pixels, and clear GIFs) on pages of our websites. These web beacons allow third parties to collect information such as the IP address of the device, the URL of the web page, the time the page was viewed, the type of browser used, and any additional information in cookies that may have been set by the third party. The information is typically collected in log files, which generally track traffic on our websites. We use web beacons to manage the content we present and for analytical purposes (such as understanding our users, and how they interact with our site, and assisting us in managing and improving our site and Service). We do not attempt to identify individual users through this information.

Do Not Track Browser Signals. At this time, our Service does not recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, which may include “do not track” instructions. However, you may be able to change your privacy preferences regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies through your browser, as described above.

## Information That We Share

We share the information we collect to the following:

  * our parent company, who helps us process our data, and develop market research datasets and analyses;
  * our affiliated companies, who enhance our market research capabilities by combining the information that we collect with other information available to them;
  * third-party service providers that help us operate and improve our Service;
  * third-party service providers that help us collect, store and process data;
  * third-party business partners that work with us to develop and resell products; and
  * customers (including third parties and affiliates) that have access to our market research datasets and analyses.



We may also disclose information about you:

  * if we are required to do so by law or legal process,
  * to law enforcement authorities or other government officials,
  * if necessary to protect the vital interests of another individual.



Additionally, we reserve the right to transfer personal information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets.

As described in the section “How We Protect Your Information,” after we collect your information, we undertake a process that is designed to de-identify this, and we may further combine or aggregate this information with other information available to us or our trusted business partners. Once the information is processed, we use and/or share this data for research and business purposes, subject to applicable laws.

## How We Protect Your Information

Data security and privacy are a priority for us, and with the assistance of our parent company, our affiliated companies and other trusted business partners, we undertake a process that is designed to de-identify / aggregate the information that we collect, and we may further combine or aggregate this information with other information available to us or our trusted business partners. Once the information is processed, we use and/or share this data for research and business purposes, subject to applicable laws.

We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect your personal information from accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use and other unlawful forms of processing. This said, no data transmissions through the Internet or via mobile devices, or even the physical transfer of information, can be guaranteed to be completely secure. We cannot fully eliminate all security risks associated with personal information. As such, we do not ensure or warrant the security of any data or information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.

## Your Choices

In certain cases, you may have choices about how we use and disclose your personal information. For example, we will ask you before we use your personal information for any purpose incompatible with those purposes identified in this policy. If we provide you with any marketing messages, we also will give you an opportunity to opt out of receiving further messages.

You can also choose not to give us the information we request, as described in the “Information You Provide to Us” section of this policy. In some cases, if you decide not to provide information, we will not be able to provide you with access to the site you requested, or we may not be able to provide you with the service, feature or information you requested.

In some cases, you can stop or limit the information we collect by automated means. Please review the sections of this policy titled “Information Collected by Automated Means” to learn more about how you may be able to stop or limit our receipt of that information.
