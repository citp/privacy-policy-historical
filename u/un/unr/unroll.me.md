# Privacy Policy | Unroll.Me

_Last updated on June 26, 2014_

Unrollme Inc. (“Unroll.me”) respects your concerns about privacy. This Privacy Notice applies to information we collect through our websites and services. By using our websites and services you agree to our collection, use, disclosure and transfer of information as described here.

This Privacy Notice describes the types of information we collect or receive, how we may use that information and with whom we may share it. The information we collect includes personal information and non-personal information, as such terms are defined below.

The Privacy Notice also describes the measures we take to protect the security of the personal information. We also tell you how you can reach us to ask us to (i) access, change or not use the personal information you have provided to us, (ii) withdraw any consent you previously provided to us, (iii) refrain from sending you email alerts, and (iv) answer any questions you may have about our privacy practices.

## Our Collection and Use of Personal Information

Personal information is data that can be used to uniquely identify or contact a single person. You may choose to provide personal information to us when you use our websites. Because we change our offerings and features from time to time, the options you have to provide us with personal information also may change, but here are some examples of situations in which you may decide to provide personal information to us:

  * Registering with our websites
  * Creating an online account
  * Signing up for email alerts or subscribing to receive information
  * Completing a survey
  * Contacting us for any reason, such as by email, including for technical support or customer service
  * Using our websites or online services when personal information is required for use or participation



The personal information we collect from you will vary depending on the service you are using, the site you are visiting, and how you access it. However, the personal information you provide generally may include your name, email address, phone number (which may include mobile phone number), and postal address.

Because we directly ask you to provide personal information in these cases, you often will be able to tell from our specific requests what types of information we receive from you.

We collect this information for reasons such as:

  * To provide you with access to the site, service or feature you requested
  * To offer you tailored content, such as ads
  * To provide you with technical support or customer service
  * To communicate with you, respond to your requests, or provide you with updates and information
  * To manage your account
  * To better understand our users, their interests and their preferences
  * To develop, deliver, and improve our products, services, and other offerings



## Our Collection and Use of Non-personal Information

We also collect non-personal information − data in a form that does not permit direct association with any specific individual. We may collect, use, transfer, sell, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. For example, when you use our services, we may collect data from and about the “commercial electronic mail messages” and “transactional or relationship messages” (as such terms are defined in the CAN-SPAM Act (15 U.S.C. 7702 et. seq.) that are sent to your email accounts so that we can better understand the behavior of the senders of such messages, and better understand our customer behavior and improve our products, services, and advertising, and we may disclose, distribute, transfer, and sell such messages, and the data that we collect from or in connection with such messages, provided, however, if we do disclose such messages or data, all personal information will be removed prior to any such disclosure.

If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.

Aggregated data is considered non-personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Notice.

## Information Collected by Automated Means

We may obtain certain personal and non-personal information by automated means when you visit our sites. The type of information we collect by automated means may vary, but generally includes technical information about your computer, such as IP address or other device identifier. The information we collect also may include usage information and statistics about your interaction with our websites. That information may include the URLs of our web pages that users visited, URLs of referring and exiting pages, page views, time spent on a page, number of clicks, platform type, and other information about how you used our websites. 

In cases where you use a mobile device to access our sites we will receive information about the location of your device. In some cases, even if you are not using a mobile device, information about your general location may be discernable from your device’s IP address or the URLs we receive. If you access or use our sites or services with your mobile telephone, we may collect your telephone number.

Please note that if ads or other features on our site are provided by third parties, those parties also may use automated means of data collection that are subject to those third parties’ privacy notices and policies.

We use information we collect by automated means to understand our users and to determine their preferences. As a result, we can develop and deliver new or modified offerings, improved with our users’ preferences in mind. As described below, we also may use it to provide a more personalized user experience and to manage advertising.

Here are some of the types of automated data collection that may occur when you use our sites:

#### Web Browsers

When you visit one of our websites, your browser automatically sends us your Internet protocol (“IP”) address so that the web pages you request can be sent to your computer or device. We use your IP address to determine additional information, such as whether the computer or device has ever been used to visit our site before, which site features were used the most often, and how much time was spent on a page.

#### Cookies

We may automatically collect information through “cookies,” which are text files placed on your device’s hard drive when you visit websites. Cookies may enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular site. We use cookies, for example, for authentication purposes and to measure session activity on the site and determine which areas and features of the site are the most popular. Most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie and how to disable existing cookies. Without cookies, however, you may not be able to take full advantage of all our site features. 

We also may use “flash cookies,” also called “local shared objects.” Like other cookies, flash cookies are files stored on your computer, but flash cookies can store information that is more complex than simple text. These cookies can be helpful to us in storing your preferences regarding feature settings, and personalizing your experience. In some cases local shared objects also are used to prevent fraud. Unlike “regular” cookies, browsers generally cannot be used to manage cookie placement. To learn more about managing flash cookies, you may wish to consult Adobe’s website and change the privacy settings they make available to users who wish to manage flash cookies. Like regular cookies, flash cookies improve your experience with our site, so disabling them may limit or eliminate features we make available to you.

#### Web Beacons and Log Files

We may use “web beacons” (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags, tracking pixels, and clear GIFs) on pages of our website. These web beacons allow third parties to collect information such as the IP address of the device, the URL of the web page, the time the page was viewed, the type of browser used, and any additional information in cookies that may have been set by the third party. The information is typically collected in log files, which generally track traffic on our websites. Purposes for this information collection may include managing our online advertising, including by determining which ads brought users to our websites. The information also is used for analytical purposes and to manage technical issues that may arise. We do not attempt to identify individual users through this information.

## Sharing of Information

We may share personal information we collect with our trusted business partners. We also will share personal information with service providers that perform services on our behalf. These partners and service providers are not authorized by us to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. 

We also may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process, (ii) to law enforcement authorities or other government officials, (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity, or (iv) if necessary to protect the vital interests of another individual. We also reserve the right to transfer personal information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. 

As described in “Our Collection and Use of Non-personal Information” above, we may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose.

When you use our websites, you agree that we may share information about you as described here.

## Your Choices

In certain cases, you may have choices about how we use and disclose your personal information. For example, we have to ask you before we can use your personal information for any purpose incompatible with those purposes identified in this Notice. If we provide you with any marketing messages, we also will give you an opportunity to opt out of receiving further messages. 

You also can choose not to give us the information we request, as described in the “Information You Provide to Us” section of this Notice. In some cases, if you decide not to provide information we will not be able to provide you with access to the site you requested, or we may not be able to provide you with the service, feature or information you requested.

In some cases, you can stop or limit the information we collect by automated means. Please review the sections of this Notice titled “Information Collected by Automated Means” to learn more about how you may be able to stop or limit our receipt of that information.

You may exercise and amend your choices by sending an email to us as specified in the “How to Contact Us” section below. 

## Access and Correction

We will provide you with the ability to access and update certain information we have about you, such as your contact information. Your right to access or amend personal information may be limited in some circumstances. Please submit your request by sending an email to the address specified in the “How to Contact Us” section below. Please include your name, email address and postal address in your request so that we may respond appropriately and promptly.

## How We Protect Personal Information

We maintain appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect your personal information from accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use and other unlawful forms of processing. 

## Links to Other Sites

We may provide links to other sites for your convenience and information. These sites may be operated by organizations not affiliated with Unroll.me so we cannot control and are not responsible for their content, operation, or privacy practices. Those organizations may have their own privacy policies, which we strongly suggest you review if you use other sites. This Notice does not apply to those sites, even if we link to them or they link to us.

## Children’s Privacy

Unroll.me does not direct its websites to children, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personal information from a user who is under the age of thirteen, we will delete the information from our records.

## Transfers of Information

As part of our international operations, we may transfer information about you to any jurisdiction where we do business. Even if those jurisdictions do not have the same privacy laws as the jurisdiction where you reside, we will treat your information as subject to the protections described in this Notice. When you use our websites, you agree that we may transfer information about you as described here.

## Updates to Our Privacy Notice

This Privacy Notice may be updated periodically to you to reflect changes in our information practices or relevant laws. We will indicate at the top of the Notice when it was updated. Please review this Notice any time you access or use our sites to make sure you have reviewed the most recent version.
