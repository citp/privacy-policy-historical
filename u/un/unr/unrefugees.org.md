**Collection of personal data**

In order to process credit card transactions online it is necessary to collect some information. The name of the donor, the address of the donor, the type of credit card, the credit card number and expiration date, and the amount of the donation are required to process any transaction.

In addition, the United States Association for UNHCR collects a telephone number and email address from those individuals agreeing to provide them in case we must contact donors because of an inaccurate name, credit card number or expiration date. Failure to provide a telephone number or email address may result in a donation not being posted.

The United States Association for UNHCR also collects a mailing address from individuals willing to provide one. From time to time we mail information about the activities of our association to those who are interested in the worldwide refugee activities of UNHCR. We may also solicit for funds to support specific UNHCR programs in these mailings. We also use mailing addresses to provide written acknowledgments of all contributions. The IRS will disallow any charitable contributions of $250 or more that is not substantiated by a “contemporaneous written acknowledgement.” In order to best serve our donors, the United States Association for UNHCR provides these acknowledgements.

If at any time a donor wishes to have his or her name and personal information deleted from our records or if a donor would like to make changes to their personal information, including his or her name, address, phone number, email address, credit card information, etc., we comply as quickly as possible.
