**Collection of personal data** In order to process credit card transactions online it is necessary to collect some information. The name of the donor, the address of the donor, the type of credit card, the credit card number and expiration date, and the amount of the donation are required to process any transaction.

In addition, the United States Association for UNHCR collects a telephone number and email address from those individuals agreeing to provide them in case we must contact donors because of an inaccurate name, credit card number or expiration date. Failure to provide a telephone number or email address may result in a donation not being posted.

The United States Association for UNHCR also collects a mailing address from individuals willing to provide one. From time to time we mail information about the activities of our association to those who are interested in the worldwide refugee activities of UNHCR. We may also solicit for funds to support specific UNHCR programs in these mailings. We also use mailing addresses to provide written acknowledgments of all contributions. The IRS will disallow any charitable contributions of $250 or more that is not substantiated by a "contemporaneous written acknowledgement." In order to best serve our donors, the United States Association for UNHCR provides these acknowledgements.

If at any time a donor wishes to have his or her name and personal information deleted from our records or if a donor would like to make changes to their personal information, including his or her name, address, phone number, email address, credit card information, etc., we comply as quickly as possible. To remove your name and address from our records or to make changes to your account please send an email to [info@usaforunhcr.org](mailto:info@usaforunhcr.org) or call (800) 770-1100.

**Disclosure to third parties  
**  
In an effort to decrease fundraising costs related to acquiring new donors, the United States Association for UNHCR occasionally exchanges the name and address of some of its supporters with likeminded organizations. Donors who would prefer their names and addresses not be exchanged should inform us by calling (800) 770-1100 or by sending an email to [info@usaforunhcr.org](mailto:info@usaforunhcr.org). The United States Association for UNHCR will make every effort to prevent the personal information of donors who so request from being exchanged.

The United States Association for UNHCR does not rent, exchange or sell the e-mail addresses or credit card information of our supporters.

**Information security and quality  
**  
The United States Association for UNHCR intends to protect the quality and integrity of our supporters’ personally identifiable information. We have implemented appropriate physical, technical and organizational measures, such as using industry-accepted encryption for transmission of credit card information, to help keep your information secure, accurate, current and complete.

Donations made on the www.UNrefugees.org website are secure to the fullest extent possible. We use strong 128-bit encryption through Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. SSL protects information as it is transferred through the Internet.

You can recognize secure web pages by checking for the secure symbol at the bottom of your browser screen. For most browsers, this symbol is either a lock or a key. When the lock or key symbol appears the page is secure. When the lock or key is not evident, the page is insecure.

The United States Association for UNHCR protects all paper files as well. Any personal information recorded on paper file is secured in a locked facility at all times. Only two permanent full time staff members have access to the files.
