### General Statement

By accessing this site, certain information about the User, such as Internet protocol (IP) addresses, navigation through the Site, the software used and the time spent, along with other similar information, will be stored on United Nations or its Designated Third Party (e.g. OECD and/or Ingenta) servers. These will not specifically identify the User.

The information will be used internally only for web site traffic analysis. If the User provides unique identifying information, such as name, address and other information on forms stored on this Site, such information will be used only for statistical purposes and will not be published for general access. The United Nations, however, assumes no responsibility for the security of this information. 

### Specific to United Nations iLibrary

The specific practices outlined in this privacy statement apply to the **United Nations iLibrary**   [http://www.un-ilibrary.org](http://www.un-ilibrary.org/ "United Nations iLibrary web site").  Other entities linked to the United Nations may have slightly different practices, though the commitment to your privacy will always be the same. You are encouraged to review the privacy statements of other entities when visiting their Web sites. Our Web site(s) may include links to a third party Web server(s) for online payments.

### Data Collection and Use

In general, you can browse the **United Nations iLibrary** web site without disclosing any information about yourself. If you visit United Nations iLibrary web site to read or download information, we collect and store only the following information that is automatically recognised: the date and time, the originating IP address, the domain name, the type of browser and operating system used (if provided by the browser), the URL of the referring page (if provided by the browser), the object requested and the completion status of the request.  

### Cookies and Web Technology

The **United Nations iLibrary** makes use of "session" cookies. These are small bits of data that we send to your computer in order to improve your user experience. For example, the cookie keeps track of the fact that you have signed in so that when you move from one page to another, you don't have to reenter your user name and password. Session cookies are removed as soon as you log out or close your browser. 

In order to change these cookie preferences, you must change your browser's preferences to disable or delete cookies. Please note that disabling cookies for some services may affect your ability to use that service. Security information is specific to each browser and operating system. Please check with your browser's specific company for more information, or visit the “Help” link directly in your browser. 

An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer when you connect to a network. Web servers—the computers that present Web pages—automatically identify your computer by its IP address. We identify IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to our institutional customers, and to audit the use of our site. As is typical, when visitors request pages from United Nations iLibrary, our servers log the visitors' IP addresses, referrer site and user-agent information. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. We use such information to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our house rules or terms of service or to protect our service, site, customers, or others. 

If you have questions or comments about our customer privacy policy or you would like to confirm the accuracy of the information collected from you, please contact/mail your concerns to: [United Nations Publications](mailto:ilibrary@un.org "Email the United Nations Publications team")
