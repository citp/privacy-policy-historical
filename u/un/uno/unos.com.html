  cookies allow us to tailor a website to better match your interests and preferences.
  Notably, our websites use cookies to help understand which parts of our websites
  are most popular, where our visitors are going and how much time they spend
  there. Cookies are read only by the server that placed them, and are unable

<p>Also, where specific programs associated with our websites require a user
  ID and password, you have the option of requesting that we save your user ID
  and password so that you will not have to re-enter that information the next

  requires these entities to confine their use of cookies to the uses permitted
  by this Policy, but the Company cannot be responsible for third party uses
  of cookies.</p>
<p class="white14">Offline v. Online Practices</p>
<p>This Policy applies solely to the Company's information-gathering and dissemination
  practices in connection with its websites in the United States, and does not
