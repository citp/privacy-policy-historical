UNOS will not collect any personally-identifiable information about you (e.g., your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address ["personal data"]) through our Web site unless you have provided it to us voluntarily.

We do not now and do not intend to sell, rent, or market personal data about you to third parties.

In some cases, we may automatically (i.e., not via registration) collect technical information when you connect to our Web site that is not personally-identifiable. Examples of this type of information include the type of Internet browser you are using, the type of computer operating system you are using, and the domain name of the Web site from which you linked to our site.
