# Privacy Policy – UNKNWN

**PRIVACY POLICY**

**Effective Date: JUNE 20, 2016**

UNKNWN values your privacy. This Privacy Policy tells you how UNKNWN treats the information it collects through its website and mobile app (collectively, the "Properties").

**INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

We collect information from a variety of sources, including information provided by you, information we collect when you visit our Properties, transaction information, and information we collect about you from third party sources. This information may include your name, address, zip code, email address, telephone number(s), credit card number(s), and date of birth. We may also collect precise location data from your mobile device, when such features are enabled.

UNKNWN may also collect other non-personal information from you, such as your browser type or IP address.

**INFORMATION USE AND DISCLOSURE**

UNKNWN uses the information it collects to personalize and improve your experience on the Properties; to fulfill your requests and other transactions; to send you offers we think may be of interest in you; to enter you into promotions and contests; to fulfill customer service requests; and to conduct research and analytics on our Properties.

UNKNWN does not share customer information outside the UNKNWN family unless it is necessary to provide you with our products or services. UNKNWN may share your information with third party service providers who administer our promotions and contests. We may also disclose information when you consent at the time of collection to us doing so, to protect your rights or the rights of UNKNWN, or as required or permitted by the law. If our store is acquired or merged with another company, including through bankruptcy, your information may be transferred to the new owners so that we may continue to sell products to you.

**BROWSER COOKIES**

UNKNWN uses cookies in order to improve your shopping experience. Cookies help us keep track of your order as you shop on our Properties. We also use cookies to recognize registered customers when they visit our Properties and to provide them with their account information. If you register with or order from us, we use cookies to monitor and maintain information about your use of our Properties. If you have not registered with or ordered from us, we may monitor and maintain information about your use of our website in a manner that does not identify you.

You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you turn off cookies, though, we will not be able to track your order to enable you to purchase from our site.

**INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING**

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Properties. These companies may use cookies or other technologies to collect non-personal information about your visits to our Properties and other online properties in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. We may also partner with ad networks and other companies that serve ads on behalf of us and others on non-affiliated web sites. Some of those ads may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on information these ad networks collect about your visits to our web site and other non-affiliated web sites or apps over time.

You may visit [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices "www.aboutads.info/choices") to learn more about interest-based advertising and hot to opt-out of this form of advertising on your web browser by companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") self-regulatory program. If you wish to opt-out of interest-based advertising in mobile apps on your device by companies that participate in the DAA’s AppChoices app, you may download that app onto your device and exercise your choice. AppChoices is available at the links below:

You may also limit data collection by third parties by using your mobile device settings. Please note that electing to opt-out will not stop advertising from appearing in your browser or applications. It may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests. Additionally, please note that if you use a different browser or erase cookies from your browser, or use a different mobile device, you may need to renew your opt-out choices.

**DATA STORAGE**

Our store is hosted on Shopify Inc. They provide us with the online e-commerce platform that allows us to sell our products and services to you.

Your data is securely stored through Shopify’s data storage, databases and the general Shopify application.

Your purchase transaction data is stored only as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction information is deleted.

**THIRD-PARTY SERVICES**

In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.

**INTERNATIONAL VISITORS**

UNKNWN collects and processes information in the United States. By using our Properties from locations outside of the United States, you consent to the transfer of your personal information to, and the collection and processing of such information within the United States.

**LINKS**

When you click on links on our Properties, they may direct you away from our Properties. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites and encourage you to read their privacy statements.

Once you leave our Properties or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our website’s Terms of Service.

To protect your personal information, we take reasonable precautions and follow industry best practices to make sure it is not inappropriately lost, misused, accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed.
