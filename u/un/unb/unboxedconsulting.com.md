The retention periods stated in this notice can be prolonged or shortened as may be required (for example, in the event that legal proceedings apply to the data or if there is an ongoing investigation into the data). 

We review the personal data (and the categories of personal data) we are holding on a regular basis to ensure the data we are holding is still relevant to our business and is accurate. If we discover that certain data we are holding is no longer necessary or accurate, we will take reasonable steps to correct or delete this data as may be required. 

If you wish to request that data we hold about you is amended or deleted, please refer to “Your Privacy Rights” below.. 

### Your privacy rights

The GDPR gives you the following rights in respect of personal data we hold about you (and we agree that such rights will be available to you up before the GDPR is in force): 

The right to be informed | You have a right to know about our personal data protection and data processing activities, details of which are contained in this notice.  
---|---  
The right of access | You can make what is known as a Subject Access Request (“SAR”) to request information about the personal data we hold about you (free of charge, save for reasonable expenses for repeat requests). If you wish to make a SAR please contact us as described below.  
The right to correction |  Please inform us if information we hold about you is incomplete or inaccurate in any way and we will update our records as soon as possible, but in any event within one month. We will take reasonable steps to communicate the change to any third parties to whom we have passed the same information.   
The right to erasure (the ‘right to be forgotten’) |  Please notify us if you no longer wish us to hold personal data about you (although in practice it is not possible to provide our services without holding your personal data). Unless we have reasonable grounds to refuse the erasure, on receipt of such a request we will securely delete the personal data in question within one month. The data may continue to exist in certain backup, but we will take steps to ensure that it will not be accessible. We will communicate the erasure to any third parties to whom we have passed the same information.   
The right to restrict processing | You can request that we no longer process your personal data in certain ways, whilst not requiring us to delete the same data.  
The right to data portability | You have right to receive copies of personal data we hold about you in a commonly used and easily storable format (please let us know a format which suits you). You may also request that we transfer your personal data directly to third party (where technically possible).  
The right to object | Unless we have overriding legitimate grounds for such processing, you may object to us using your personal data if you feel your fundamental rights and freedoms are impacted. You may also object if we use your personal data for direct marketing purposes (including profiling) or for research or statistical purposes. Please notify your objection to us and we will gladly cease such processing, unless we have overriding legitimate grounds.  
Rights with respect to automated decision-making and profiling | You have a right not to be subject to automated decision-making (including profiling) when those decisions have a legal (or similarly significant effect) on you. You are not entitled to this right when the automated processing is necessary for us to perform our obligations under a contract with you, it is permitted by law, or if you have given your explicit consent.  
Right to withdraw consent | If we are relying on your consent as the basis on which we are processing your personal data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Even if you have not expressly given your consent to our processing, you also have the right to object (see above).  
  
All SARs and other requests or notifications in respect of your above rights must be sent to us in writing to [hello@unboxed.co](mailto:hello@unboxed.co) or by telephoning [+44 (0)20 7183 4250](tel:+44 \(0\)20 7183 4250). 

We will endeavour to comply with such requests as soon as possible but in any event we will comply within one month of receipt (unless a longer period of time to respond is reasonable by virtue of the complexity or number of your requests). 

### Data Breaches

If personal data we hold about you is subject to a breach or unauthorised disclosure or access, we will report this to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). 

If a breach is likely to result in a risk to your data rights and freedoms, we will notify you as soon as possible.
