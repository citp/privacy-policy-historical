<p><strong>I. Scope of this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes the types of personal information Untappd (“Untappd,” “us,” “we” or “our”) collects through https://untappd.com, https://business.untappd.com, https://store.untappd.com, the Untappd mobile applications and various related services (the “Site”), and how we collect, use, and share that information. This Privacy Policy does not govern our collection of personal information through any other website or other means, other than through the Site.</p>
<p>Our processing of personal data, such as your name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number, shall be undertaken consistent with the requirements of applicable privacy laws, including, but not limited to, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to provide to users and potential users of our website information about the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process and to advise data subjects of their rights. Whether we serve as the data controller or processor, Untappd has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the protection of personal data processed through the Site. However, Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so please understand that absolute protection is not assured.</p>
<p>By using the Site, you accept and expressly agree to our practices surrounding the collection, use, and sharing of personal information provided by you in the manner described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, you cannot, and we do not authorize you to, access, browse, or use the Site.</p>

<p><strong>F. Transfer of Data Abroad</strong>
If your personal data is subject to the GDPR, Untappd will transfer personal data from the European Economic Area (EEA) to a location outside the EEA only when there has been a documented adequacy determination, or where Untappd has confirmed adequate privacy protections. If Untappd transfers personal data to a third party acting as an agent of Untappd, we will also obligate the third party to have adequate privacy protections in place.</p>
<p>Untappd may transfer personal data to and on behalf of clients and third parties with whom Untappd has an existing service agreement or as part of our legal obligations, each of which shall be subject to Untappd policies, and only to the extent necessary for purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the data controller (or by a third party).</p>
<p><strong>G. Automated Decision Making</strong>
Under the GDPR, data subjects have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her, or similarly significantly affects him or her, as long as the decision (1) is not is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller, or (2) is not authorized by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard the data subject’s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, or (3) is not based on the data subject’s explicit consent. We do not engage in automated decision making.</p>
<p><strong>H. Further processing</strong>
If we wish to use your personal data for a new purpose, not covered by this Privacy Policy, then we will provide you with a new notice explaining this new use prior to commencing the processing and setting out the relevant purposes and processing conditions. Where and whenever necessary, we will seek your prior consent to the new processing.</p>
<p><strong>VII. Information Storage and Security</strong></p>
<p>We employ reasonable security precautions to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of personal information provided on or through the Site. These security measures include: : storing passwords in hashed form, anticross-site-request forgery measures, SSL encryption of CMS communications, and a monitoring system to actively screen for unwanted behaviors. However, no method of transmitting or storing data is completely secure. As a result, although we strive to protect personal information about you, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us through or in connection with the Site. If you have reason to believe that personal information is no longer secure, please notify us immediately by contacting us in accordance with the last section below.</p>
