# Welcome to the University of Houston-Victoria

The University of Houston-Victoria maintains this web site as a public service. The following is the privacy policy for this site (all pages starting with www.uhv.edu and www2.uhv.edu) 

We use cookies and other technologies to learn how to improve the quality of our online service to you. A "cookie" is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the website again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. A cookie file may be used to track such things as lists of pages you've visited, and the date when you last looked at a specific page, or to identify your session at a particular web site. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. 

If you send us an electronic mail message with a question or comment that contains personally-identifying information, or fill out a form that submits this information to us electronically, we may combine the information collected from you with information available within the university or from third parties to provide you with better service. We may redirect your message to another government agency or person who is in a better position to answer your question. 

For site management functions, information is collected for analysis and statistical purposes. We do not report or use this information in any manner that would reveal personally identifiable information, and will not release it to any outside parties unless legally required to do so in connection with law enforcement investigations or other legal proceedings. 

We use log analysis tools to create summary statistics, which are used for purposes such as assessing what information is of most interest, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas.
