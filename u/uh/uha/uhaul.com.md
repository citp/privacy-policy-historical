# U-Haul.com: Privacy policy

### Privacy, security and cookies

Web Team Associates, Inc. has created this statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for our websites.

**No personally identifiable customer information is sold or traded to unaffiliated companies.**

Users have the option to not receive future communications. Please send email to the [Webmaster](https://www.uhaul.com/customer/feedback/website_feedback.aspx) to be removed.

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. Your IP address and email address are used to help identify you and your shopping cart and to gather broad demographic information.

This site may contain links to other sites. **Web Team Associates, Inc. is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites.**

Our site uses forms for customers to request pricing, products, services, and any other available information. We collect customer contact information (such as name, phone number, email address and mailing address) and financial information (such as account or credit card numbers). Contact information is used to contact customers regarding their quotes, reservations and/or purchases. Financial information is used, only by Web Team Associates, Inc., to charge the customer for products and services.

### Cookies

Have you heard a bit about 'cookies' and wondered what they mean to your Web browser?

Or have you been a bit curious about how we use cookies at uhaul.com? Well, the answers are pretty simple.

A cookie is a small bit of text used by a browser to store information. When you visit a site that uses cookies, the Web server will request permission to pass a cookie to your browser. If accepted, it will occupy only a few bytes on your hard drive and can improve your Web surfing experience. We use cookies to track customer visits through our site. This information enables us to save you time when returning to the site by saving your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit. Cookies also provide a smoother shopping experience by helping us to uniquely identify shopping carts.

Cookies cannot profile your system or collect information from your hard drive. And although you may receive cookies from many different sites, each cookie can only be read by the Web server that originally issued it. At uhaul.com, we do not use cookies to store credit card numbers or any other personal identification. You aren't even identified by name or e-mail address, just by a unique string of numbers that we assign the first time you come to our site - a sort of virtual identity.

### Security

Our intent is to provide privacy, integrity, and authentication in regards to our Internet communication. The security measures we have taken are intended to secure and encrypt your data, so that a third party cannot capture, read or access the information while it is in transit between your computer and our system.

Specifically, we use standard-based Internet protocols to safeguard the information you provide during the purchase, payment and most information submittal processes. We use a secure server implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to interact with you when you provide personal information during the purchase and payment processes. These processes use up to 128 bit encryption.

We limit internal access to our servers and require that Web Team Associates, Inc. employees use integrity in performing their jobs and conducting business. 

### Changes in our policy

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post the changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone.
