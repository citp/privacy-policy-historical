### Cookies

Have you heard a bit about 'cookies' and wondered what they mean to your web browser? 

Or have you been a bit curious about how we use cookies at uhaul.com? Well, the answers are pretty simple. 

A cookie is a small bit of text used by a browser to store information. When you visit a site that uses cookies, the web server will request permission to pass a cookie to your browser. If accepted, it will occupy only a few bytes on your hard drive and can improve your web surfing experience. We use cookies to track customer visits through our site. This information enables us to save you time when returning to the site by saving your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit. Cookies also provide a smoother shopping experience by helping us to uniquely identify shopping carts. 

Cookies cannot profile your system or collect information from your hard drive. And although you may receive cookies from many different sites, each cookie can only be read by the Web server that originally issued it. At uhaul.com, we do not use cookies to store credit card numbers or any other personal identification. You aren't even identified by name or e-mail address, just by a unique string of numbers that we assign the first time you come to our site — a sort of virtual identity. 

### Security

Our intent is to provide privacy, integrity, and authentication in regards to our internet communication. The security measures we have taken are intended to secure and encrypt your data, so that a third party cannot capture, read or access the information while it is in transit between your computer and our system. 

Specifically, we use standard-based internet protocols to safeguard the information you provide during the purchase, payment and most information submittal processes. We use a secure server implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to interact with you when you provide personal information during the purchase and payment processes. These processes use up to 128 bit encryption. 

We limit internal access to our servers and require that Web Team Associates, Inc. employees use integrity in performing their jobs and conducting business.
