### Health and medical information

Certain health and medical information about you is protected under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”). Health and medical information protected under HIPAA may be provided by you on-line or off-line, or may be collected by us from other methods such as from a health care provider. We protect covered health and medical information as required by HIPAA. Similarly, we may use covered health and medical information as permitted by HIPAA.

In the event of any conflict between the requirements and/or permitted uses of covered health and medical information under our HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices and this Internet Privacy Policy, the terms of our HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices shall control.

### Cookies and non-personal information

“Non-personal information” means information that does not permit us to specifically identify you by your full name or similar unique identifying information such as a social security number, address, or telephone number. UnitedHealthcare uses “cookie” technology to gather non-personal information from our website visitors such as which pages are used and how often they are used, and to enable certain features on this website.

You may disable these cookies by adjusting your browser preferences on your computer at any time, however this may limit your ability to take advantage of all the features on this website. Keep in mind that cookies are not used to collect any personal information and do not tell us who you are. Some examples of the way we use cookies include:

  * Recording general site statistics and activity.
  * Assisting users experiencing website problems.
  * Enabling certain functions and tools on this website.
  * Tracking paths of visitors to this site and within this site.



We may also collect other forms of non-personal information such as what web browsers are used to read our website and what websites are referring traffic or linking to our website. Aggregate and de-identified data regarding website users is also considered non-personal information.

### With whom is non-personal information shared?

Because non-personal information does not identify who you are, we do not limit the ways we may use or share non-personal information. For example, we may share non-personal information with our affiliates, suppliers, employees and agents, other businesses, and the government.

### Personal information provided by you

“Personal information” means information that specifically identifies you as an individual, such as your full name, telephone number, email address, postal address, or certain account numbers. As used in this Internet Privacy Policy, personal information does not include information protected under HIPAA, which is protected as described in the section “Medical and Health Information” above.

This website may include web pages that give you the opportunity to provide us with personal information about yourself. **You do not have to provide us with personal information if you do not want to; however, that may limit your ability to use certain functions of this website.**

We may combine personal information that you provide us through this website with other personal information held by UnitedHealthcare, our affiliates, or our vendors. For example, if you have purchased a product or services from us, we may combine personal information you provide through this website with information regarding your receipt of the product or service.  


We may use personal information for a number of purposes such as:

  * To respond to an email or particular request from you.
  * To personalize the website for you.
  * To process an application as requested by you.
  * To provide you with information that we believe may be useful to you, such as information about health products or services provided by us or other businesses.
  * To comply with applicable laws, regulations, and legal process.
  * To protect someone's health, safety, or welfare.
  * To protect our rights or take appropriate legal action, such as to enforce our Terms of Use.
  * To keep a record of our transactions and communications.
  * As otherwise necessary or useful for us to conduct our business, so long as such use is permitted by law.



### With whom is personal information shared?

We will only share your personal information with third parties as permitted by this Privacy Policy (in its current or future form) and as otherwise permitted by law. We share and give access to personal information to our employees and agents in the course of operating our business. For example, if you sent us an email asking a question, we would provide your email address to one of our employees or agents, along with your question, in order for that person to reply to your email. We may share personal information with other UnitedHealthcare parent, subsidiary, or affiliate businesses.

We also share and give access to personal information with other companies that we hire or collaborate with to perform services or functions on our behalf. For example, we may hire an outside company to help us send and manage email, and in that case we might provide the outside company with your email address and certain other information in order for them to send you an email message on our behalf. Similarly, we may hire outside companies to host or operate some of our websites and related computers.

However, if we share or give access to information to outside companies we require them to use the personal information only for limited purposes, such as for sending you the email in the example above. If you believe we or any company associated with UnitedHealthcare has misused any of your information please contact us immediately and report such misuse.

We may share personal information if all or part of UnitedHealthcare is sold, merged, dissolved, acquired, or in a similar transaction.

We may share personal information in response to a court order, subpoena, search warrant, law or regulation. We may cooperate with law enforcement authorities in investigating and prosecuting website visitors who violate our rules or engage in behavior that is harmful to other visitors or is illegal.

If this function is available, we will include a link on this website with a heading such as “My Profile” or similar words. Clicking on the link will take you to a page through which you may review your visitor profile and related personal information.

It is possible that your email communication may be accessed or viewed inappropriately by another Internet user while in transit to us.

We may send email communications to you related to general health benefits, website updates, health conditions and general health topics.
