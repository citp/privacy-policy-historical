**Website Privacy Policy**

**Introduction**  
We recognize that the privacy of your personal information is important to you.  The purpose of this Website Privacy Policy is to let you know how we handle the information we receive from you through this website. Portions of this website may describe additional privacy practices applicable to specific types of information or to information provided on specific Web pages. 

This Website Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected through other means such as by telephone or in person, although that information may be protected by other privacy policies. As used in this Website Privacy Policy, terms such as “we” or “our” and “Company” refer to Golden Rule and its current and future affiliate entities, including our parent company UnitedHealth Group. 

This site is intended for a United States audience.  Any information you provide, including any personal information, will be transferred to and processed by a computer server located within the U.S.

**Cookies and non-personal information**  
“Non-personal information” means information that does not permit us to specifically identify you by your full name or similar unique identifying information such as a social security number, member identification number, address or telephone number. The Company uses various technologies, which may include “cookie” technology, to gather non-personal information from our website visitors such as which pages are used and how often they are used, and to enable certain features on this website. 

“Cookies” are small text files that may be placed on your computer when you visit a website.  Cookies may include “single-session cookies” which generally record information during only a single visit to a website and then are erased, and “persistent” cookies which are generally stored on a computer unless or until they are deleted or are set to expire.  Your computer may permit you to disable cookies and similar items by adjusting your browser preferences at any time; however, this may limit your ability to take advantage of all the features on this website. 

  We may also collect other forms of non-personal information such as what web browsers are used to read our website and what websites are referring traffic or linking to our website. Aggregate and de-identified data regarding website users is also considered non-personal information. 

   We may use and disclose non-personal information unless restricted by this policy or by law.  Some examples of the ways we use non-personal information include:

  * Customizing your experience on the website including managing and recording your preferences.
  * Marketing, product development, and research purposes.
  * Tracking resources and data accessed on the website. 
  * Developing reports regarding site usage, activity, and statistics. 
  * Assisting users experiencing website problems. 
  * Enabling certain functions and tools on this website. 
  * Tracking paths of visitors to this site and within this site. 



**Your Personal information**  
“Personal information” means information that specifically identifies you as an individual, such as your full name, telephone number, e-mail address, postal address, or certain account numbers. 

This website may include web pages that give you the opportunity to provide us with personal information about yourself. You do not have to provide us with personal information if you do not want to; however, that may limit your ability to use certain functions of this website or to request certain services or information. 

We may use personal information for a number of purposes such as:

  * To respond to an e-mail or particular request from you. 
  * To personalize the website for you.

  * To administer surveys and promotions. 
  * To provide you with information that we believe may be useful to you, such as information about health products or services provided by us or other businesses. 
  * To perform analytics and to improve our products, websites, and advertising. 
  * To comply with applicable laws, regulations, and legal process. 
  * To protect someone’s health, safety, or welfare. 
  * To protect our rights, the rights of affiliates or related third parties, or take appropriate legal action, such as to enforce our Terms of Use. 
  * To keep a record of our transactions and communications. 
  * As otherwise necessary or useful for us to conduct our business, so long as such use is permitted by law. 



We may use personal information to contact you, consistent with applicable law, through any contact information you provide through our websites, including any email address, telephone number, cell phone number, text message number, or fax number. Please see the section below titled “Our online communications practices.”

We may share personal information within the Company, and we may combine personal information that you provide us through this website with other information we have received from you, whether online or offline, or from other sources such as from our vendors.  For example, if you have purchased a product or service from us, we may combine personal information you provide through this website with information regarding your receipt of the product or service.

We may share personal information in response to a court order, subpoena, search warrant, law or regulation. We may cooperate with law enforcement authorities in investigating and prosecuting activities that are illegal, violate our rules, or may be harmful to other visitors. 

If you submit information or a posting to a chat room, bulletin board, or similar “chat” related portion of this website, the information you submit along with your screen name will be visible to all visitors, and such visitors may share with others. Therefore, please be thoughtful in what you write and understand that this information may become public.

We may share personal information with other companies that we hire to perform services on our behalf or collaborate with. For example, we may hire a company to help us send and manage e-mail, and we might provide the company with your e-mail address and certain other information in order for them to send you an e-mail message on our behalf. Similarly, we may hire companies to host or operate some of our websites and related computers and software applications.

Most e-mail, including any e-mail functionality on our site, does not provide a completely secure and confidential means of communication.
