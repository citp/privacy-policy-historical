# UBS - Privacy Policy

UBS AG ("UBS", "we" or "us"), which includes UBS AG's subsidiaries and branches, is aware that you may wish to be informed about how any personal data and financial information ("Data") that you may send via the Internet to the UBS website ("Website") is treated. Accordingly we have developed this Privacy Policy ("Policy") to explain all our reasonable precautions to keep your Data secure.

This Website may include hyperlinks to other websites that are not operated or controlled by UBS ("Third Party Sites"). This Policy only applies to this Website and UBS is not responsible for the content or the privacy practises of Third Party Sites.

This Policy may be updated and we therefore invite you to consult this Policy from time to time in order to familiarise yourself with any changes. The last paragraph of this Policy indicates when the Policy was last updated.

The terms of this Policy are without prejudice to any contractual terms you may enter into with us, which will take precedence over the terms of this Policy.

**Data Transfer to UBS and Trans-border Data Flow**

Please be aware that the Internet is generally not regarded as a secure environment, and that Data sent via the Internet can be accessed by unauthorised third parties, potentially leading to disclosures, changes in content or technical failures. Data sent via the Internet may be transmitted across international borders even though both sender and receiver are located in the same country. Therefore, your Data may be forwarded to a country with a lower data protection level than exists in your country of residence.

UBS accepts no responsibility or liability for the security of your Data whilst in transit via the Internet to us. In order to protect the privacy we would like to remind you that you may choose another means of communication with us, where you deem it appropriate.

In specific situations, UBS provides an encrypted communication transfer for your Data (e.g. e-banking service), but this will be specifically indicated.

**Processing of Data by UBS and Use for Marketing Purposes**

UBS does not collect personally identifying Data from this Website except when specifically and knowingly provided by you. In the latter case, subject to any applicable local laws, we may use your personal information to market products and services we believe might be of interest to you.

UBS may use session specific cookies* or web bugs** to obtain non-personal information Data regarding your use of this Website including IP address*** and session number****. This Data will be collected primarily for purposes of administering or compiling demographic information, and of monitoring usage and performance of this Website. We may also use such cookies to facilitate your movement within this Website (e.g. remembering passwords during the session and recording any country of residency selection you may have made.)

You may disable web bugs by disabling the javascript in your browser within the security settings. However, once javascript is disabled the site may not function correctly. You may also set your browser in order to disable any cookies that may be used by UBS: **Netscape 6.0** : (1) Task Bar (2) Edit (3) Preferences (4) Advanced (5) Cookies; **Netscape 7.0** : (1) Edit (2) Preferences (3) Category column (on the left hand side) (4) Privacy & Security (5) Cookies (6) Disable cookies (7) OK; **Internet Explorer 6.0** : (1) Tools (2) Internet Options (3) Privacy (4) Custom Level (5) Advanced (6) Override automatic cookie handling - Accept, Block or Prompt; **Internet Explorer 5.0 or 5.5** : (1) Tools (2) Internet Options (3) Security (4) Custom Level (5) Cookies option - Accept, Disable, or Prompt.

**Data Security**

Within UBS your personal Data will be transmitted and stored in a protected environment (e.g. firewalls). We undertake to take all reasonable steps in order not to allow your personal Data to be seen by any third parties other than those, which have been engaged by UBS to provide services to you. We will only disclose your Data to other third parties, if compelled to do so for legal or regulatory purposes.

We may store Data in locations other than your country of residence. In such cases UBS will endeavour to ensure that there are adequate levels of protection for your Data taking into account applicable legal and regulatory requirements, including those relating to banking secrecy and data protection.
