    <strong>What’s changed?</strong> On Thursday 18th October 2012 we updated our privacy policies by consolidating them into one document.
    
    </p>

    <p>
    
    <strong>Why?</strong> We care about your privacy and want to ensure that it is clear what personal information we are collecting from you, when we collect it and what we do with that personal information. By consolidating all of our policies into one place we hope that it will be easier for you to see what we're doing.
    
    </p>

    <p>
    
    <strong>What's changed?</strong> Nothing. We're not doing anything different with your personal information. We're just making things clearer.
    
    </p>

    <p>
    
    Please read the updated Privacy Policy to find out more.
    
    </p>

  <div class="section" id="general">

    <p>
    
    Canonical collects personal information from you in a number of different ways. For example, when you download one of our products, receive services from us or use one of our websites (including <a href="http://www.canonical.com/">www.canonical.com</a> and <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">www.ubuntu.com</a>).</p>
    
    <p></p>

    <p>
    
    At Canonical, we consider your privacy to be extremely important to us. These are the fundamental principles that we follow in relation to your personal information:
    
    </p>

    <ul class="items">
      <li>
      
      We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
      
      </li>
      <li>
      
      We don't share your personal information with anyone except to provide you with services, products, to comply with the law, or to protect our rights
      
      </li>
      <li>
      
      We don't store personal information unless required for the on-going operation of services to you, to provide you with products, to comply with law or to protect our rights.
      
      </li>
      <li>
      
      We will use personal information that you provide to us in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
      
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2 id="what-we-collect">What we collect</h2>

    <p>
    
    We may collect the following types of personal information from you:
    
    </p>

    <ul class="items">
      <li>
      
      <strong>Websites</strong> - When you register to use certain parts of our websites, such as wikis or message boards, or register for free accounts, we may ask for personal information such as your full name, email address and a password.
      
      </li>
      <li>
      
      <strong>Chat rooms, forums and newsgroups</strong> - These are available to our community. Any information that you disclose in these areas becomes public information and may be recorded, archived and republished by anyone. Please exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal information in such areas.
      
      </li>
      <li>
      
      <strong>Canonical products</strong> - When you register for services or purchase any product from Canonical, we may ask for information such as your email address, billing address, and credit card information. Credit card information is only used in processing your transaction. Please note that we may use a third party payment processing merchant to process your payments.
      
      </li>
      <li>
      
      <strong>Non-personally identifying information</strong> - Canonical may collect non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor's request. Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how visitors use our websites and services. For further information about ow we use cookies, see the “cookie” section below.
      
      </li>
      <li>
      
      <strong>Error reports</strong> - When you chose to send an error report, it includes a unique identifier for your computer. This identifier does not identify you, unless you (or someone acting on your behalf) discloses it separately. An error report may include personal information such as the state of programs that were running at the time. You can block future error reports from the privacy panel of System Settings.
      
      </li>
      <li>
      
      <strong>Ubuntu Online Accounts</strong> - When you use Ubuntu Online Accounts, your personal information is stored on your PC and it can be accessed by some applications. <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/aboutus/online-accounts-legal-notice">To see the legal notice explaining how we use this personal information, please click here.</a>
      
      </li>
      <li>
      
      <strong>General</strong> - If you contact us and provide us with information, we may keep a record of that correspondence and information.
      
      </li>
    </ul>

  <div class="section">
    <h2 id="what-we-do-with-what-we-collect">What do we do with the information we collect</h2>

    <p>
    
    We may use your information in the following ways:
    
    </p>

      <li>
      
      To analyse the performance or the appropriateness of products or services.
      
      </li>
      <li>
      
      To comply with legal and regulatory requirements (including responding to court orders, subpoenas and to prevent crime). These special circumstances may require us to disclose personal information.
      
      </li>
      <li>
      
      To contact you if your actions violate your agreement with us (if any).
