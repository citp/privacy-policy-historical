<p>Your trust is our most valuable asset. We safeguard that trust by keeping your non-public personal information or personally identifiable information as well as user content and material (called "data" herein) in a secure environment. In order to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect from you.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about our privacy statement or our use of your data or if you need help changing or deleting your account you can e-mail us at <strong>legal(a)uberchar.com</strong></p>

<h4>1.- Information Collection</h4>

<p>We may collect the following data about you and/or your use of our Site:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Data we receive from you when you signup, request a service, or file a claim, such as name, surname, address, country, email, birthdate, genre and other information about your preferences and/or interests.</li>

</ul>

<h4>2.- Information Use</h4>

<p>Except as disclosed in this statement, we do not sell or disclose information that identifies our users personally or makes it possible for other parties to contact them directly without our users' consent. We may use, sell, disclose, or otherwise dispose of the data we collect in the following circumstances:</p>

<p>Internal Analysis and Promotions. We may use information about you for our own internal statistical, design, operational purposes such as to estimate our audience size; measure aggregate traffic patterns; and understand demographic, customer interest, purchasing and other trends among our users and customers.</p>

<p>Legal Requirement. We may disclose user data:</p>

<p>(a) to conform with the law, respond to claims or comply with legal process.</p>

<p>(b) to protect and defend our or our user's rights or property, our Site, our employees, guests or the public, including fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of our Site.</p>

<p>(c) if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger to any person requires disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure of records without delay.</p>

<p>Company Sale. All information collected through our Site is considered a trade secret of Uberchar. As the owner of such information, we may disclose or sell such information as an asset of the company in conjunction with the sale to a third party of our company or a portion of our assets.</p>

<p>Aggregate Information. We collect Aggregate Information about you and your use of our Site whenever you visit us online. For instance, we may collect various forms of "click stream" information such as entry and exit points for our Site (i.e., referring URLs or domains), site traffic statistics, page views, impressions, and operating system and browser type. In addition, when users request pages on our Site, our servers automatically log their IP addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web.</p>

<p>We also may use third-party software that tracks traffic directed to our Site from affiliate web sites and the purchases that result from this traffic. This information is aggregated and is not tied to an individual purchase.</p>

<p>This Aggregate Information generally will not personally identify you or be correlated to you individually for external purposes. We may collect, compile, store, publish, promote, report, sell, or otherwise disclose or use any and all Aggregate Information, provided that, such information does not personally identify you. When we share such information with other companies, it is not traceable to any particular user, and will not be used to contact you. If we do correlate any Aggregate Information to you, such information will be treated like any other personal information under this statement.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding any preference that you select, we may contact you from time to time to provide services that you have requested or for customer service matters, such as responding to service-related inquiries, updating our policies, notifying you of changes to existing services or new Site functionalities.</p>


<h4>3.- Cookies and Web Beacons</h4>

<p>We may make use of "cookies" on our Site. Cookies are small text files that are stored on a user's device by a Web server based on the permissions set in a user's browser software. A cookie itself is not designed or intended to read any information from a user's device (other than the contents of the cookie); rather, it is an identifier used by the Web site that originally placed it on your hard drive. The actual contents of the cookie information can be retrieved by the same server to identify the device and subsequently to customize, monitor, or regulate the use of a site based on information stored on the host server. Therefore, cookies only identify the user's device to the Web site which may correlate other information, including personally identifying information, with the cookie.</p>

<p>We may use cookies to allow us to automate access and data entry functions of our Site such as to correlate online ordering information for purchases you may make while at the Site (if any), tailor the Site to your preferences or interests, or customize promotions or marketing. In addition, cookies allow us to track use of the Site to determine those areas which are useful or popular and those that are not thereby enabling us to improve and update the Site effectively.</p>

<p>We also may use third party advertisements on our Site.  Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our Site, which will also send these advertisers information that may include your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our Site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited.</p>

<p>You may adjust your Web browsers to either alert you of the use of cookies or refuse to accept cookies entirely. Be aware that if you elect not to accept cookies, our Site may not function properly or permit access.</p>

<p>We may use Web beacons on our Site or other sites and may permit third parties to place them on our Site to monitor the effectiveness of advertising or for other legitimate purposes. A Web beacon, also known as a "Web bug," is a small, graphic image on a Web page, Web-based document or in an e-mail message that is designed to allow the site owner or a third party to monitor who is visiting a site. Web beacons are often invisible to the user because they are typically very small (only 1-by-1 pixel) and the same color as the background of the Web page, document or e-mail message. Web beacons are represented as HTML IMG tags in the Web page; users can click on "view profiles" of the web page to see whether the page is using a web beacon.</p>

<p>Web beacons collect the IP address of the computer that the Web beacon is sent to, the URL of the page the Web beacon comes from and the time it was viewed. Web beacons can also be linked to personal information. For example, advertising networks use Web beacons to add information to a personal profile of what sites a person is visiting and to determine what banner ads to display based on the profile. Another use of Web beacons is to provide an independent accounting of how many people have visited a particular Web site. Web beacons are also used to gather statistics about Web browser usage at different places on the Internet.</p>

<h4>4.- Links</h4>

<p>Please be aware that we and/or our users provide links to third-party Web sites and that we are not responsible for the content or information collection practices of those sites.</p>

<h4>5.- Security</h4>

<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

<p>We restrict access to data about you to those employees whom we know have a valid business purpose to have access to such data to provide products or services to you. We provide training and communications programs to our employees. These programs educate them on the meaning and requirements of our strict standards for data security and confidentiality. We require those who provide services for us and to whom we may provide your data to abide by the same security restrictions.</p>
