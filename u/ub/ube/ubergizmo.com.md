UberGizmo may launch a mailing list in 2005. In order to sign up to receive regular emails from this mailing list, users must submit information including a valid email address and demographic information such as location and interests. This information will be used in aggregate form only in order to assess general user interest in various internal and third party products and services, and your personal and contact information will not be passed to any other organization. Users who choose to sign up for the mailing list will receive regular emails from UberGizmo including new articles added to the site as well as emails from third party UberGizmo site sponsors. If you do not wish to receive emails from third party advertisers, do not sign up for the mailing list.
