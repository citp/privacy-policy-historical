# UBEX AI PRIVACY POLICY

                                                                               1 | Privacy Policy | Ubex AI
UBEX AI PRIVACY POLICY
Effective: June 27, 2019
We have prepared this Privacy Policy to explain how, why, and when we collect data from you to provide
targeted advertising services for our clients. This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who
are concerned with how their data is being used online. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear
understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle data you provide us.
We will use the information that we collect about you in accordance with the EU General Data Protection
Regulation (Regulation EU 2016/679), (further — “GDPR”) which becomes effective from 25 May 2018.
1. About Ubex AI services
Ubex AI («Ubex» or «Platform») is the platform that allows our Clients to buy or sell ad space on
websites for online advertising. Our clients are businesses engaged in Internet advertising —
advertisers, publishers, ad networks or ad agencies. Our clients buy and sell media by participating
in online exchanges for ad space. Our technology powers this platform. When ad space on a
website is bought or sold, usually to an advertiser, ad agency or ad network by a publisher, Ubex,
as an agent for its clients, fulfills the transaction by delivering the ad to the Internet user who visits
that site.
When you visit a website operated by an Advertiser or a third-party website where we could serve
an ad to you, we may collect some or all of the Personal data described in the Ubex Privacy Notice.
Our Platform uses that data as well as other data described below to help Advertisers provide ads
to you that are more relevant to your preferences. For example, if you visit an Advertiser's website
and shop for a mobile device, our Platform (or another platform we work with) may later serve you
with targeted ads for the Advertiser’s brand of gadget as you browse the internet or through other
channels, such as mobile apps.
2. What is personal data?
Personal data means information relating to a living individual who can be directly or indirectly
identified from that data. Identification can be by the information alone or in conjunction with any
other information in the data controller’s possession or likely to come into such possession. The
processing of personal data is governed by the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”).
3. What does this Privacy Policy cover?

regulations and in accordance with special agreements between Ubex and each of the Partners.

by Ubex to uniquely identify you.

and freedoms.
We neither read packets of information from the HTTP requests (packet-sniffing) nor perform

only.
We do not collect any impression-level data through the ad that will be used for subsequent ad
targeting.
8. How does Ubex protect your Personal information?
In most cases, Personal information is processed automatically without access to it by our staff.
However, if such access is necessary, your Personal information can be accessed only by those
Ubex employees whose professional tasks require using this information. To protect your Personal
information and ensure its confidentiality, these employees must comply with internal rules and
follow protocols for processing Personal information. They are also required to follow all technical
and organizational security measures protecting your Personal information.


                                                                          5 | Privacy Policy | Ubex AI
Ubex has also implemented adequate technical and organizational measures to protect Personal
information against unauthorized, accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, misuse,
disclosure or access and against all other unlawful forms of processing. These security measures
have been implemented taking into account the state of the art of the technology, their cost of
implementation, the risks presented by the processing and the nature of Personal information.
Prior to binding agreements with any publisher or data provider that shares targeting data with
Ubex, we are committed to ensure that those agreements include opt-out for any users that do not
want to be uniquely tracked/targeted with advertisers.
No method of transmission over the mobile web or method of electronic storage is 100% secure;
therefore, while Ubex strives to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we
cannot guarantee absolute security.
This online privacy policy applies only to information collected through our Platform, not to
information collected offline.

Therefore, Ubex has taken appropriate measures to ensure that Personal information is handled
according to applicable EU data protection rules.
12.Do we transfer your data?
Due to the international nature of Ubex in the course of our operations, we may need to process
data on a server located outside of the country in which you reside. In such case, we will use

accordance with this Privacy Policy. For instance, data collected on the Website covered by this
Privacy Policy is processed and stored in the United States.

Ubex will only keep your Personal information for as long as it is necessary to fulfil the purpose for
which it was collected or to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, but no longer than 18
months.

our systems as part of the Service, will remain stored as long as you have an account with us, but

Personal information collected through cookies placed on your device may be transmitted to and

available on the above third parties’ websites. Ubex or those third parties might also provide you

regulations applicable to such products, utilities and offerings.

requested. If after you have approved the use of cookies you want to make another choice, you can
do this by deleting the cookies stored by your browser (usually via the options in your browser’s


                                                                             9 | Privacy Policy | Ubex AI

    14.5.        Other tracking mechanisms we use for data collection across all platforms:
    •   Tags and Pixels
        Tags and Pixels are code snippets that we and our clients may use to track your browsing
        on the Internet: from resources to any particular websites or applications to track your
        browsing behavior. Sometimes web beacons are used for these purposes. They are usually
        transparent or invisible graphic images, no larger than 1x1 pixel, they are placed on a page
        or otherwise, Internet resource or sent within an e-mail to monitor the behavior of the user
        visiting the resource or sending the e-mail. It is often used in combination with cookies. We
        create and use a unique synchronization system to check the quality of information that we
        have collected with information that our clients collected independently, and later help our
        clients or third parties that intend to provide you with targeted advertisements.
    •   Mobile Device Identifiers
        Mobile Device Identifiers or Mobile Device IDs are unique identifiers which can be used to
        identify a mobile device. We may use standard device identifiers (UDID) that we may
        receive from 3rd parties, to track your use of mobile applications and to determine if a piece
        of advertisement inventory has been delivered to a specific user or retargeted, or to
        determine the frequency of certain inventory for a certain user. Ultimately, passing device’s
        ID back to advertisers helps us and our clients to improve the quality of advertising and its
        efficiency (targeting). Ubex does not directly collect and store UDIDs or similar Mobile
        Device Identifier technologies.
    •   Software Development Kits
        These are blocks of code or algorithm similar to Tags and Pixels that are embedded into a
        digital resource that allows us to track certain information related to the application use,
        gathered during the process of utilizing our technology
    •   Other technologies
        Please be aware that we use other technologies to collect user information in order to assist
        users with the inventory delivery and to provide reporting to our clients or to evaluate the
        quality of advertisement.
