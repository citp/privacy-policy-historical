For example, in some countries, we enable driver partners and riders, and delivery partners and recipients, to call or text each other without disclosing their telephone numbers. To provide this service, Uber receives some information regarding the calls or texts, including the date and time of the call/text, and the content of the text messages. Uber may also use this information for customer support services (including to resolve disputes between users), for safety and security purposes, and for analytics.</p></li><li class="detail" style="color:#000000;direction:ltr;font-size:14px;line-height:1.71;text-align:left;" data-reactid="216"><p class="detail" style="direction:ltr;margin-bottom:3px;margin-top:3px;text-align:left;" data-reactid="217"><strong data-reactid="218">Address book and calendar information</strong></p><p class="detail" style="direction:ltr;margin-bottom:3px;margin-top:3px;text-align:left;" data-reactid="219">If you permit the Uber app to access the address book on your device, we may collect names and contact information from your address book to facilitate social interactions through our services and for other purposes described in this policy or at the time of consent or collection.
