Grounds for Processing**\n\nThe GDPR requires that companies processing the personal data of EU users do so on the basis of specific legal grounds.  As described below, Uber processes the information of EU users based on one or more of the grounds specified under the GDPR:\n\n  *   **a. The processing is necessary to provide the services and features you request**\n\n    *   Uber must collect and use certain information in order to provide its services. This includes:\n\n        *   User profile information that is necessary to establish and maintain your account, including to verify your identity; enable communications with you about your trips, orders and accounts; and to enable you to make payments or receive earnings.\n\n        *   Background check Information necessary to enable drivers to provide transportation services through the Uber app.\n\n        *   Driver location Information, which is necessary to match drivers with riders, and to track trips while in-progress and suggest navigation.\n\n        *   Transaction information, which is necessary to generate and maintain in connection with your use of Uber's services.\n\n        *   Usage information, which is necessary to maintain, optimize and enhance Uber's services, including to determine, sometimes in combination with other information, incentives, connect riders and drivers, and calculate costs of trips and driver earnings.\n\n    *   Collection and use of this information is a requirement for using Uber's apps.\n\n  *   **b. The processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of our users or of others**\n\n    *   Uber may process personal information, including disclosing data with law enforcement authorities in case of threats to the safety of users or of others.\n\n  *   **c. The processing is necessary for Uber's legitimate interests**\n\n    *   Uber collects and uses personal information to the extent necessary for its legitimate interests. This includes collecting and using information:\n\n        *   To maintain and enhance our users' safety and security. For example, we collect background check information (where permitted by law) to prevent unsafe users from providing services through our apps. We also use personal information to prevent use of our services by users who have engaged in inappropriate or dangerous behavior, such as by retaining information of banned users to prevent their use of Uber's apps. We also use usage information to prevent matching of riders and drivers for whom there is higher risk of conflict (e.g., because they have been the subject of prior complaints from other users).\n\n        *   To prevent, detect and combat fraud in connection with the use of our services. For example, Uber uses user profile, location, device and usage information, to identify and prevent circumstances when users attempt to defraud Uber or other users.\n\n        *   To inform law enforcement officials regarding criminal acts or threats to public safety.\n\n        *   To provide customer support.\n\n        *   To optimize our service and develop new services. This includes, for example, identifying the best pick-up \u002F drop locations, recommending (new) features, improving navigation, and enhancing pricing and matching riders and drivers or delivery recipients and partners.\n\n        *   For research and analytical purposes. This includes, for example, analyzing usage trends to improve the user experience and enhance the safety and security of our services.\n\n        *   For direct marketing purposes. This includes, for example, analysing data to identify trends and tailor marketing messages to user needs.\n\n        *   To enforce Uber's Terms of Service.\n\n  *   **d. The processing is necessary for the legitimate interests of other persons or parties**\n\n    *   Uber collects and uses personal information to the extent necessary for the interests of other persons or the general public. This includes sharing information in connection with legal or insurance claims, to protect the rights and safety of others.\n\n    *   Uber may also process personal information when necessary in regards to a substantial public interest, on the basis of applicable laws.\n\n  *   **e. The processing is necessary to fulfill Uber's legal obligations**\n\n    *   Uber is subject to legal requirements in the jurisdictions in which it operates that require us to collect, process, disclose and retain your personal data. For example, Uber is subject to laws and regulations in many cities and countries that require it to collect and retain information about your trips, to retain such information for extended periods of time, and to provide copies of such information to governmental or other authorities. Uber uses your information to comply with such laws to the extent they apply to your use of the Uber apps.\n\n    *   Uber may also share information with law enforcement, or requests by third parties pursuant to legal processes. For more information about such sharing, please see Uber's [Guidelines for Law Enforcement Authorities in the United States](${guidelinesForLawEnforcementAuthoritiesInTheUnitedStatesLink}), [Guidelines for Law Enforcement Authorities Outside the United States](${guidelinesForLawEnforcementAuthoritiesOutsideTheUnitedStatesLink}), and [Guidelines for Third Party Data Requests](${guidelinesForThirdPartyDataRequestsLink}).\n\n  *   **f. Consent**\n\n    *   Uber may collect and use your information on the basis of your consent. You may revoke your consent at any time. If you revoke your consent, you will not be able to use any service or feature that requires collection or use of the information we collected or used on the basis of consent.\n\n    *   Uber relies on consent in connection with data collections or uses that are necessary to enhance the user experience, to enable optional services or features, or to communicate with you. If you are an EU user, the following types of data collections or uses are done on the basis of your consent.\n\n        *   Location Information (Riders)\n\n        *   Share Live Location (Riders)\n\n        *   Notifications: Account and Trip Updates\n\n        *   Notifications: Discounts and News\n\n        *   Accessibility features\n\n    *   Please see the Choice & Transparency section below for further information about these data collections and uses, how to opt in or out of them, and the effect of opting out of these on your use of Uber's apps.\n\n    *   Uber may also collect personal information about you through voluntary surveys.
