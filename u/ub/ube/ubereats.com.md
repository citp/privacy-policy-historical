# Uber Privacy

**_Some of Uber's products, services and features require that we share information with other users or at your request. We may also share your information with our affiliates, subsidiaries and business partners, for legal reasons or in connection with claims or disputes._**

Uber may share the information we collect:

  1.  **With other users**


  * For example, if you are a rider, we may share your first name, average rider rating given by drivers, and pickup and/or dropoff locations with drivers. If you share an uberPOOL trip with another rider, that rider may be told your name and may see your pickup and/or dropoff location.

  * If you are a driver or delivery partner, we may share information with your rider(s) including name and photo; vehicle make, model, color, license plate, and vehicle photo; location; average rating provided by riders; total number of trips; for how long you have been using the Uber app; and contact information (depending upon applicable laws). If you choose to complete a driver profile, we may also share any information associated with that profile, including information that you submit and compliments that past riders have submitted about you. The rider/delivery recipient will also receive a receipt containing information such as a breakdown of amounts charged, your first name, photo, and a map of the route you took.



  2.  **At your request**



This includes sharing your information with:

  *  **Other people at your request.** For example, we may share your ETA and location with a friend at your request, or your trip information when you split a fare with a friend.

  *  **Uber business partners.** For example, if you requested a service through a partnership or promotional offering made by a third party, Uber may share your information with those third parties. This may include, for example, other apps or websites that integrate with our APIs, vehicle suppliers, or services, or those with an API or service with which we integrate, or business partners with whom Uber may partner with to deliver a promotion, a contest or a specialized service.



  3.  **With the general public when you submit content to a public forum**



We love hearing from our users -\- including through public forums such as Uber blogs, social media, and certain features on our network. When you communicate with us through those channels, your communications may be viewable by the public.

  4.  **With the owner of Uber accounts that you may use**



If you use a profile associated with another party we may share your trip information with the owner of that profile. This occurs, for example, if you are:

  * A rider using your employer’s Uber for Business profile, or taking trips arranged through [Uber Central](https://help.uber.com/h/502388e3-df83-4c4b-964d-625a1d161e12).
  * A driver using an account owned by a partner transportation company.
  * A rider who takes a trip arranged by a friend or under a Family Profile.
  * A delivery partner acting as a substitute (U.K. only).


  5.  **With Uber subsidiaries and affiliates**



We share information with our subsidiaries and affiliates to help us provide our services or conduct data processing on our behalf. For example, Uber processes and stores information in the United States on behalf of its international subsidiaries and affiliates.

  6.  **With Uber service providers and business partners**



Uber may provide information to its vendors, consultants, marketing partners, research firms, and other service providers or business partners. This may include, for example:

  * Payment processors and facilitators.

  * Background check providers (drivers and delivery partners only).

  * Cloud storage providers.

  * Marketing partners and marketing platform providers.

  * Data analytics providers.

  * Research partners, including those performing surveys or research projects in partnership with Uber or on Uber’s behalf.

  * Vendors that assist Uber to enhance the safety and security of its apps.

  * Consultants, lawyers, accountants and other professional service providers.

  * Fleet partners.

  * Insurance and financing partners.

  * Airports.

  * Yandex Taxi and other local providers.

  * Restaurant partners.

  * Vehicle solution vendors or third party vehicle suppliers.



  7.  **For legal reasons or in the event of a dispute**



Uber may share your information if we believe it is required by applicable law, regulation, operating agreement, legal process or governmental request, or where the disclosure is otherwise appropriate due to safety or similar concerns.

This includes sharing your information with law enforcement officials, government authorities, airports (if required by the airport authorities as a condition of operating on airport property), or other third parties as necessary to enforce our Terms of Service, user agreements, or other policies, to protect Uber’s rights or property or the rights, safety or property of others, or in the event of a claim or dispute relating to your use of our services. If you use another person’s credit card, we may be required by law to share information with that credit card holder, including trip information.

This also includes sharing your information with others in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, consolidation or restructuring, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by or into another company.

Please see [Uber's Guidelines for Law Enforcement Authorities](https://help.uber.com/h/d678feed-0afa-49b8-82ea-9c72cc1afd5f) for more information.
