        We will tell you what measures we take to secure that information. </p>
      <p>We will tell you what information we share about you with other entities. 
        We will explain what your rights are, and how you can exercise them. If 
        you share an account relationship with someone else, such as a joint account 
        holder or co-borrower, we suggest that you share this information with 
        such persons to ensure that each of you is aware of our policy and your 
        options. </p>
      <p>We define some terms. </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Nonpublic personal information means information about you that we

          or government records. Hereafter, we will use the term "information" 
          to mean nonpublic personal information as defined in this section. </li>
        <li>An affiliate is a company we own or control, a company that owns or 
          controls us, or a company that is owned or controlled by the same company 
          that owns or controls us. Ownership does not mean complete ownership, 
          but means owning enough to have control, as defined by federal law. 
        </li>
        <li>A nonaffiliated third party is a person we do not employ or a company 
          that is not an affiliate of ours. This is also known as nonaffiliated 
          third party, or simply, an "other party." </li>
        <li>Opt out means a choice you can make to prevent certain sharing of 
          information. We will explain how you can exercise this choice.</li>
