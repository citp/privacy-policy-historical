"Personal Information" is information that can be used to identify you, either
alone or in combination with other information. uBiome collects and stores
the following types of Personal Information:
•  "Registration Information" is the information you provide about yourself
   when registering for and/or purchasing our Services (e.g. name, email,

How We Use Your Information
• uBiome collects Personal Information from you for all purposes
  necessary to ensure the regular operation of your account and/or

  participate in specific research projects, contacting you to obtain
  testimonials or for other promotional purposes; performing quality control
  activities; conducting other R&D; and, upon your authorization,
  conducting uBiome Research.
• We use Registration Information to enable your purchase, inform you
  when your Phenotypic Information is available to you, provide you with
  customer service, manage our Services, and authenticate your website
  visits and usage.
• We may disclose to third parties, and/or use in our Services,
  "Aggregated Phenotypic and Self-Reported Information", which is
  Phenotypic and Self-Reported Information that has been stripped of
  Registration Information and combined with data from a number of other
  users sufficient to minimize the possibility of exposing individual-level
  information while still providing scientific evidence of greater scientific
  import.
• If you have given consent for your Phenotypic and Self-Reported
  Information to be used in uBiome Research as described in the
  applicable Consent Document, we may include such information in
  Aggregated Phenotypic and Self-Reported Information intended to be
  published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. If you have given consent
  to participate in uBiome Research, we may also allow research
  contractors to access your individual-level Phenotypic and/or Self-
  Reported Information onsite at uBiome’s offices for the purpose of


   conducting scientific research, provided that all such research
   contractors will be supervised by uBiome and subject to uBiome’s
   access rules and guidelines.

   Information to be used in uBiome Research, we may still use your
   Phenotypic and/or Self-Reported Information for other purposes, which
   may include disclosure of Aggregated Phenotypic and Self-Reported
   Information to third-party non-profit and/or commercial research partners
   who will not publish that information in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.
•  Except as otherwise set forth herein, we will never release your
   individual-level Phenotypic and/or Self-Reported Information to a third
   party without asking for and receiving your explicit consent to do so,
   unless required by law.
•  We use Web Behavior Information to track and monitor aggregate usage
   of our website, for R&D, for quality control, to improve our Services,
   and/or to target advertising for our products and services, and if you
   have given consent to participate in uBiome Research as described in
   the applicable Consent Document, your Web Behavior Information may
   be used and disclosed to third parties in aggregate form for uBiome
   Research intended to be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals.
•  If you do not give consent to participate in uBiome Research, we may
   still use your Web Behavior Information for R&D purposes as described
   above, which may include disclosure of aggregated Web Behavior
   Information to third-party non-profit and/or commercial research partners
   who will not publish that information in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.

   uBiome customers through sharing features.

We will not disclose your individual-level Personal Information to any third
party, except under the following circumstances:

   or credit card processors) use and/or store the information in order to

   your individual-level Phenotypic and Self-Reported Information on-site at
   uBiome's offices for the purpose of scientific research, provided that all
