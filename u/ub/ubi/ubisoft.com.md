**Q2** | **What types of personally identifiable information do we collect about our guests?**  
**A2** | 

We collect several types of personal information about our guests. Personal information is information that identifies you and may be used to contact you. 

Information You Provide to Us 

All of the personal information we receive comes directly from our guests. We collect personal information from our guests to: 

  * Create a Ubi.com account 
  * Apply for a beta tester position 
  * Subscribe to one of our newsletters 
  * Email-a-friend 
  * Participate in our community forums or chat rooms 
  * Shop at one of our online stores 
  * Receive customer or technical support 
  * Participate in contests, events, or promotions 
  * Register product online for warranty protection 
  * Polls, surveys, or questionnaires 

Typically, this information includes: 
  * name 
  * email address 
  * telephone number 
  * shipping and billing address, and 
  * for those purchasing products online, credit card information. 

Additionally, we may also collect other types of non-personal information (known as demographic information) such as your age or date of birth, gender, country and zip code of residence, recent game purchases, and game ownership and preferences. This demographic information may be associated with your personal information. 

**Information Collected Through Technology**

We collect information through technology to make our websites more interesting and useful to you. For example, when you come to one of our websites, we collect your IP address. An IP address is often associated with the portal through which you enter the Internet, like your ISP (Internet service provider), your company, or your university. Standing alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable. At times, we also use IP addresses to collect information regarding the frequency with which our guests visit various parts of our websites. We may combine this information with personally identifiable information.  


Ubisoft may collect information regarding the user’s behaviour, and his/her use of Ubisoft’s demos and games to better adapt our products and services to users.

**Cookies**

Our websites also use cookies. Cookies are pieces of information that a website sends to your computer while you are viewing the website. We and other companies use cookies for a variety of purposes. For example, when you return to one of our websites after logging in, cookies provide information to the website so that the website will remember who you are. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You can do this through your browser (like Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many features that make your web experience smoother, like the features mentioned above, and some of our services may not function properly. 

Finally, once you've clicked on an advertisement and have left our websites, our Privacy Policy no longer applies and you must read the privacy policy of the advertiser to see how your personal information will be handled on their website.

**Q3** | **How is your personally identifiable information used and shared?**

LASource   
Privacy Policy:  
<http://www.thesource.ca/estore/content/privacy.aspx?language=en-CA>a>

The third party vendors listed in this section may change. Accordingly, Ubisoft will make best efforts to update this section of our Privacy Policy. However, we do encourage you to review the privacy policy and/or terms of use of any site you share your personal information with. Information collected from those who create an ubi.com account is used to provide services to you, such as subscriptions to our general newsletter, email announcements relating to your account, free online gameplaying, access to the latest game news and exclusive store promotions, and participation in community forums and contests and sweepstakes. In some instances, however, you may also be given the option to have your information used for an activity or service different from the activity or service that you are requesting (e.g., have your name entered into a contest when subscribing to a game-specific newsletter and vice versa). If you choose to receive these additional services, we will use your information to provide you those services. 

Should you decide to link your Ubisoft Account to your console manufacturer gaming account, Ubisoft will only exchange information regarding your age, country, date of birth and email with such parties. No other personal information, such as your credit card information or address, will be exchanged with such parties. 

**Ubisoft Updates**

We may also use your email address to send you service announcements that tell you about updates to our Privacy Policy, changes in pricing, changes to our online service or customer support policies, and other related service changes. Also, please note that if you create a ubi.com and your account is later cancelled (e.g., due to lack of activity), we may subsequently contact you to let you know that we've reactivated your account for a short period of time. 

Whatever the purpose may be, we will only collect information to the extent reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests and our legitimate business objectives. 

**Operational Uses**

We may also use your personal information for other purposes such as "Operational Uses." For example, we may use your information to send you administrative communications either about your account with us or about features of our websites, including any future changes to this Privacy Policy. 

**Aggregate Information**

Finally, we may take your personally identifiable information and make it non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you (de-personalizing your information). Given the nature of this information, no restrictions apply under this Privacy Policy on our right to aggregate or de-personalize your personal information, and we may use and share in any way with third parties the resulting non-personally identifiable information. 

**Business Information**

For practical reasons, we treat personal information submitted to us in a business capacity different from information we receive in a non-business capacity. Personal information submitted to us in a business capacity (e.g. resumes) may be shared with third parties, depending on the nature of the inquiry. 

**Purchase or Sale of Businesses**

From time to time, we may purchase a business or sell one or more of our businesses and your personally identifiable information may be transferred as a part of the purchase or sale. If we purchase a business, the personally identifiable information received with that business would be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy, if it is practicable and permissible to do so. If we sell a business, we will include provisions in the selling contract requiring the purchaser to treat your personally identifiable information in the same manner required by this Privacy Policy (including any amendments to this Privacy Policy). The provisions of this paragraph will also apply if we are sold as part of bankruptcy proceedings. 

**Disclosures Required By Law and Disclosures to Help Protect the Security and Safety of Our Websites and Others**

We will disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that such disclosures (a) are required by law, including, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena, or (b) will help to: enforce our Terms of Use; enforce contest, sweepstakes, promotions, and/or game rules; protect your safety or security, including the safety and security of property that belongs to you; and/or, protect the safety and security of our websites or third parties.

**Q4** | **What choices do you have about the collection, use, and sharing of your personally identifiable information?**  
**A4** |

If you contact us by email, please include the name of the website you used to register and the email address you used to register with us so we can verify your request.

**Q5** | **What kinds of security measures do we take to safeguard your personally identifiable information?**  
**A5** | 

The security and confidentiality of your personal information is extremely important to us. We have implemented technical, administrative, and physical security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access and improper use. To prevent unauthorized electronic access to personal information, we maintain information collected online behind a firewall-protected server; use SSL encryption for purchases made through our online store; limit access to only those employees performing a legitimate business function; store your personal information on servers separate from other corporate information and systems; verify your identity by asking you for information only known to you; and notify you by email and by posting a notice on our website if we learn that a breach has occurred. From time to time, we review our security procedures to consider appropriate new technology and methods. However, please understand that, despite our best efforts, no security measure is perfect or impenetrable.

**UBISOFT’S KIDS PRIVACY POLICY**

Last updated July 18, 2008

Welcome to Ubisoft!

**OUR PRIVACY COMMITMENT**

Ubisoft has developed its websites with the goal of creating an enjoyable experience for all users.  This Kids Privacy Policy is designed to answer your questions regarding our privacy policies concerning children under the age of 13.

Building on our general Privacy Policy, we recognize the need to provide additional privacy protections when children visit sites on which we post this Kids Privacy Policy.  We explain those additional protections in this Kids Privacy Policy.

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that we inform parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use, and disclose personal information from kids under 13 years of age.  COPPA also requires us to obtain the consent of parents and guardians for children under 13 years of age to use certain features of our Web sites.  Below we explain how we do that for kids.  Also, when we use the term “parent” below, we mean to include legal guardians.

This certification seal shown on this page confirms that Ubisoft is a member in good standing of [ESRB’s Privacy Online Program](http://www.esrb.org/privacy/index.jsp).  ESRB’s Privacy Online Program is designed to ensure that our website’s information disclosure practices are responsible and appropriate.  To protect your privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this privacy initiative and all of our websites have been reviewed and certified by ESRB Privacy Online to meet established online information collection and use practices.  As part of this privacy program, ESRB independently audits our websites, and administers other enforcement and accountability mechanisms. ** _
