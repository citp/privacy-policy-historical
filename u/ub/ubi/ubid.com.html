<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#CC0000">What is uBid's Privacy &amp; Security Policy?</font></b></p>
<p><br>
<br>

uBid.com has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to protecting
your privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this
website.  As this policy may change from time to time, please check back periodically.</p>

<p>

uBid.com uses the information we collect about you to process orders. When you register at uBid.com, we
collect your name, email addresses, mailing address, credit card number, and expiration date in order to
process and fulfill your order.</p>

<p>

When you sign up for uBid Mail, we need only an email address to send you the email topics that you have
selected. We also use your email address to send you email notice of your bid and order status, and we may
use your email address to send you notice of upgrades or changes to uBid.com, new services, and special
offers.  We do not currently sell, trade, or rent our list of email addresses to any third parties, although we
do occasionally allow third parties to insert messages in our emails to you. You may choose not to receive
any of these emails when you register or at a later date by accessing My Mailbox.</p>

<p>

We occasionally will ask for additional information from you.  For instance, we may ask for your name,
address, and e-mail address in connection with a contest or other promotional feature in which you
participate, so we can administer the contest and notify winners.  We may offer contests or promotions with
third parties; policies concerning use of your personal data gathered in connection with any such contest or
promotion will be specifically set forth in the rules and policies applicable to the contest or promotion.</p>

<p>

uBid offers a service called "Tell a Buddy" that allows you to notify friends about open auctions.  Please
note, however, that uBid opposes the practice of sending unsolicited commercial emails, also known as
"spam."  Therefore, we request that you send "Tell a Buddy" emails only to people known by you who may
be interested in the auction.  If someone asks you not to send these emails to him or her, please comply.
Your friends' email addresses will not be used for promotional purposes nor disclosed to a third party.</p>

<p>

<font face="Arial" color="#003399"><b>
Cookies</b></font>
<br>
"Cookies" are pieces of information that are passed to your browser and stored on your computer's hard
drive. uBid uses cookies to recognize repeat visitors, to automatically enter your login ID in our bid form,
and to provide additional features to make shopping at uBid easier and more efficient.  If you do not wish
to receive cookies, you can turn them off using your browser's settings.</p>

<p>

<font face="Arial" color="#003399"><b>
Sharing data with third parties</b></font>
<br>
Upon registration with uBid, each of our customers is assigned a random and anonymous customer number,
which we use to track customer orders.  This customer number is different from any custom login ID
selected by you and may be passed to third party vendors with whom we work to provide more efficient
and relevant services to our users.  These third parties are unable to connect or associate this randomly
generated number with an individual email address, phone number, mailing address or any other data that
may be used to specifically identify you.  However, our anonymous customer numbers may be used to
measure traffic and visiting patterns on uBid.com and on other websites on the Internet.  We may also
compile statistics and other data about our customers on an aggregated basis, and may share such
aggregated data with selected third parties.  This aggregated data will not specifically identify you.  Finally,
uBid may release account information when we believe that such release is reasonably necessary to comply
with law, enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements or protect the rights, property or safety
of uBid, our users, or others.  uBid does not presently sell, trade or rent personal information to other
parties. We reserve the right to do so in the future, but will allow individuals to opt out of this process.

You may change your personal information at any time, including email address, phone number, mailing
address, and credit card information in My Account, located in My Page.  You may choose whether or not
to receive Outbid and order processing emails in My Account and in My Mailbox.

By registering at uBid.com, you consent to the collection and use of this information by uBid.com. In the
event of changes in our privacy policy, this page will be updated with the current information.</p>

<p>


<b><font color="#CC0000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Security
</font></b>
</p>

<p>
<font face="Arial" color="#003399"><b>How your information is encrypted</b></font>
<br>
There are two areas on the site where you may enter and submit private information. Both areas are
protected using SSL encrypted transmissions between your Web browser and our Web server. This protects
against the remote chance that someone (e.g. on your network at work or at your Internet service provider)
may try to compromise your private information as it travels from your Web browser to our secure server.
You'll know when transmitted data is safe by a security notice when you enter a secure page, and by the
presence of an icon on your browser, either a key for Netscape or a lock for Microsoft Internet Explorer.
The pages where you submit your account information, place a bid, and receive confirmation of a
successful bid are all secure. We would never intentionally take chances with your private
information, and we have taken every precaution to ensure your personal security.</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial" color="#003399"><b>Protecting your login ID and password<br>
</b></font>Always keep your uBid account number and password secret. They are your only identification for bidding
purposes. If you receive information about a bid you did not place, or questionable communications
regarding your account, please contact uBid Customer Support immediately. One
potential way for someone to steal your login ID and password is if you bookmark any area on MyPage
or a bid submission page. This is a concern if your browser is available to other people at work, home, or
especially if you use a browser at a public internet cafe. You should not bookmark such pages and you
should clear the browser cache and quit the browser completely when you are done surfing uBid. We have
also worked to protect you against such a mistake. Even if someone obtains both your login ID and
password, they cannot get your credit card information because that field is cleared when they log in to My
Page. Information cannot be changed without submitting a new credit card.</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial" color="#003399"><b>About SSL, security, and firewall problems</b></font>
<br>
Some older browsers (such as IE 3.0.2) have known SSL bugs. These can result in the browser crashing on
SSL pages or giving error messages. We recommend that you upgrade to the latest version of whatever
browser you prefer. For AOL users, you may be able to upgrade your security by downloading and
replacing the schannel.dll from Microsoft. For users behind corporate firewalls, you need to configure your
web browser security settings. This includes setting https or secure proxy settings. To determine if you
have such a security problem, you can edit a secure URL, replacing 'https' (secure) with 'http' (insecure). If
the page works with http:// but not https://, then you have a problem with your security settings. You should
contact your system administrator for assistance.</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial" color="#003399"><b>Technical Details About Encryption</b></font>
<br>
uBid operates with a VeriSign Digital Server Certificate, featuring today's strongest cryptographic
techniques to ensure that Digital IDs are not forged or tampered with. These techniques, developed by RSA
Data Security, use a matched pair of encryption and decryption keys. This use of matched-key
cryptography with a 1024-bit key length provides a level of security unavailable with conventional secret
key cryptography.
