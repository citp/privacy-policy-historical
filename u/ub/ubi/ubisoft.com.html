<p>Last updated July 10, 2013</p>

To further this commitment,  we have adopted this Privacy Policy ("Policy") to guide how we collect, store,  and use the information you provide us when you access&nbsp; Ubisoft's websites, online games, online  functions of offline games and any other online functions controlled by Ubisoft  or mobile applications (collectively, the "Services").&nbsp; If you do not agree to the terms of this  Policy, please do not use the Services.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We reserve the right to change the provisions of the  Policy at any time.&nbsp; We will alert you  that changes have been made by indicating on the Policy the date it was  revised.&nbsp; We encourage you to review this  Policy from time to time to make sure that you understand how any personal  information you provide will be used.&nbsp;  Your continued use of the Services following the posting of changes to  these terms will mean you accept those changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>This Policy and the certification seal shown on the  Site confirm that Ubisoft is a member in good standing of ESRB's Privacy Online  Program . ESRB's Privacy Online Program is designed to ensure that the Site's  information disclosure practices are responsible and appropriate. To protect  your privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this privacy initiative and this  Site has been reviewed and certified by ESRB Privacy Online to meet established  online information collection and use practices.

<p id="pp1"><strong>Q1.&nbsp; What  is Personal Information?&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>A1.&nbsp; As used  herein, the term "personal information" means information that specifically  identifies any individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile  number, e-mail address, or credit card number), or information about that  individual that is directly linked to personally identifiable information.&nbsp; Personal information does not include  "aggregate information", which is data we collect about the use of the Services  or about a group or category of services or users, from which individual  identities or other personal information has been removed.&nbsp; This Policy in no way restricts or limits our  collection and use of aggregate information.&nbsp;  Personal information also does not include a Device Identifier (as  defined below) that is not connected to personal information.&nbsp; </p>
<p id="pp2"><strong>Q2.&nbsp; What  types of personally identifiable information do we collect about our  guests?&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>A2.&nbsp; We  collect several types of personal information about our guests in a number of  ways when you visit or use the Services:</p>
<p><strong>Information You Provide to Us or Active  Collection. </strong></p>
<p>We collect certain information from you when you  voluntarily provide it, such as if you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create a <a href="http://www.Ubi.com">Ubi.com</a> account; </li>
  <li>Apply for a beta tester position; </li>
  <li>Subscribe to one of our newsletters; </li>
  <li>Email-a-friend; </li>
  <li>Participate in our community forums or chat  rooms; </li>
  <li>Shop at one of our online stores or purchase  virtual items within a Ubisoft's game; </li>
  <li>Receive customer or technical support; </li>
  <li>Participate in contests, events, or promotions; </li>
  <li>Register product online for warranty protection;  and&nbsp; </li>
  <li>Polls, surveys, or questionnaires. </li>
</ul>
<p>Typically, the personal information collected includes:  Name; email address; telephone number; shipping and billing address; date of  birth, and for those purchasing products through the Services. Additionally, we  may also collect demographic information such as your age, gender, country and  zip code of residence, recent game purchases, and game ownership and  preferences. This demographic information may be associated with your personal  information.&nbsp; If this demographic  information is connected with personal information, we will treat the  demographic information as personal information. Furthermore, Ubisoft may  collect information regarding the user's behavior, and his/her use of Ubisoft's  demos and in-game data such as achievements, rankings, time played to better  adapt our products and Services to users' interests and for a better quality of  our services</p>
<p>For some features of the Service, you may be able  to submit information about other people.&nbsp;  For instance, if you wish to send a coupon or advertisement to a friend  you may submit some of your friend's personal information.&nbsp; Ubisoft will use any such information that we  collect from you about another person to carry out your request.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Passive Collection</strong></p>
<p>When you use the Services, some information is also  automatically collected.&nbsp; Ubisoft as well  as any third party advertisers and/or service provides, may use a variety of  technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how the  Services are accessed and used ("Usage Information").&nbsp; For example, when you come to use or visit  the Services, we collect your IP address or other unique identifier ("Device  Identifier") for the computer, mobile device, technology or other device  (collectively, "Device") you use to access the Services, your operating system,  the browser type, the address of the referring web site and your activity on  the Site or your console ID. An Device Identifier&nbsp; is often associated with the portal through  which you enter the Internet, like your ISP (Internet service provider), your  company, or your university.&nbsp; We also can  use the Device Identifier to determine the general physical location of your  Device and understand from what regions on the world the visitors to the  Services come.&nbsp; Standing alone, your  Device Identifier is not personally identifiable. At times, we also use Device  Identifiers&nbsp; to collect information  regarding the frequency with which our guests visit various parts of our  websites.&nbsp; If we combine this information  with personally identifiable information, we treat this information as personal  information.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Cookies </strong></p>
<p>We may also automatically collect certain  information and monitor user activity through the use of "cookies" or web  beacons (also known as web bugs, pixel tags, tracking pixels, or clear gif's or  by monitoring a user's Device Identifier) on the Services.&nbsp; If we link cookies to any personally  identifying information, we will treat this information as personal  information.&nbsp; The web beacons we use do  not collect any personal information.&nbsp; If  you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies on the Site, please refer to  your browser manufacturer to learn about these functions.&nbsp; However, if you choose to remove or reject  cookies, this could affect certain features on the Services.&nbsp; Information provided by cookies, web beacons,  Device Identifier's or other devices may be used, among other things to analyze  data, to determine the popularity of certain content, to deliver advertising  targeted to your interests, to make recommendations to you and to better  understand the usage and visitation of the Services and the effectiveness of  Ads.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Finally, once you've clicked on an advertisement  and have left our websites, our Privacy Policy no longer applies and you must  read the privacy policy of the advertiser to see how your personal information  will be handled on their website.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Third parties may also use cookies, web beacons, or  other devices to collect information when you use the Services.&nbsp; Ubisoft does not control any cookies or other  data collection tools that may be placed on the Services by a third party, and  this Policy does not cover the use of such cookies and/or other data collection  tools by any third party.&nbsp; We encourage  you to read the privacy policies of the website and applications you use to  find out more about the information that may be collected by third parties and  the choices you have regarding the collection, use and sharing of such  information. </p>
<p><strong>Advertisements</strong></p>
<p>We may partner with third party online advertising  companies to deliver advertisements on our Services.&nbsp; Because your internet browser or mobile  device must request these advertising banners from ad networks' servers, these  companies can send their own cookies to your cookie file, just as if you had  requested a web page from the Service.&nbsp;  Please note that if an advertiser on a third party ad network asks us to  show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, males ages 18-34) or  audience segment (for example, men ages 18-34 who have viewed video game  related items) and you respond to that ad, the advertiser or ad-server may  conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to  reach.&nbsp; However, we would only authorize  third party ad servers to employ anonymous cookies for ad delivery and  anonymous targeting.&nbsp; We would not  knowingly permit a third party ad server to collect Personal Information about  you.&nbsp; If you want to prevent a third  party ad server and/or third party service provider from sending and reading  cookies on your computer or mobile device, you must visit each third party ad  server network's website individually and opt out (if they offer this  capability).&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Information Received From Third Parties</strong></p>
<p>We also may obtain certain non-personal information  about you from third parties.&nbsp; This  information may include demographic, geographic, psychographic and other usage  information that does not personally identify an individual user and may be  associated with anonymous device ID and/or a console identification  number.&nbsp; You may also choose to  participate in a third party applications or features (such as one of our  social network applications or a similar application or feature on a third  party website) through which you allow us to collect and share (or the third  party to collect and share) information about you, including personal  information.&nbsp; If you access the Services  through a third-party connection or log-in, we may also collect your user ID  and/or username associated with that third-party service, and any information you  have made public in connection with that service or with the third party shares  with partner services.&nbsp; In addition, we  may receive information about you if other users of a third party web site give  us access to their providers and you are one of their "connections" or  information about you is otherwise accessible through your "connections"  webpage, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third  party website or interactive service.&nbsp;  The collection and use of this information is pursuant to such third  party's information collection practices, which are typically outlined in a  privacy policy like this one, provided on the third party's website or in an  application.&nbsp; This Policy does not apply  to information received from third parties, and Ubisoft is not responsible for  the privacy and security practices and policies of such third parties.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We also may supplement the information we collect  about you through the Services with our information from third parties in order  to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer  you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of  interest to you.&nbsp; We may combine the  information we receive from these third parties with information we collect  through the Services.&nbsp; In those cases, we  will apply this Policy to any personal information received, unless we have  disclosed otherwise.&nbsp; </p>
<p id="pp3"><strong>Q3.&nbsp; How is your personally identifiable information  used and shared?&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>A3.&nbsp; We don't  sell or rent your personal information to third parties without your consent.  We don't require personal information to access our website. However, if you  prefer not to disclose personal information, you will not be able to enjoy  certain features of our website. </p>
<p>We use personal information we collect through the  Site for the purposes described in this Policy or elsewhere on the Site.&nbsp; For example, we may use personal and other  information we collect:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To provide the services, products or information  you request and to process and complete any transactions in connection  therewith; </li>
  <li>To request feedback and to otherwise contact you  about your account or your use of the Services.&nbsp;  For instance, if you create a <a href="http://www.Ubi.com">Ubi.com</a> and your account is later  cancelled (e.g., due to lack of activity), we may subsequently contact you to  let you know that we've reactivated your account for a short period of  time.&nbsp; We may also use your personal  information for other purposes such as "Operational Uses." For  example, we may use your information to send you administrative communications  either about your account with us or about features of our websites, including  any future changes to this Privacy Policy;</li>
  <li>To communicate with you and respond to your  emails, submissions, questions, inquiries, comments, requests, and complaints  and to provide customer service.&nbsp; For  instance, we may use your email address to send you service announcements that  tell you about updates to our Policy, changing in pricing, changes to our  online service or customer support policies, and other related service  changes.;</li>
  <li>To personalize and improve the Site and users'  experiences, to increase the functionality and user friendliness of the Site,  to deliver advertisements, content, or features that match user profiles or  interests, and to provide recommendations as to other advertisements, content  or features that may be of interest to users; </li>

<p id="pp5"><strong>Q5.&nbsp; Do we  collect information for children under the age of 13?</strong></p>
<p>A5.&nbsp; Ubisoft  is very sensitive to privacy issues. We are especially careful in any  communications with children under the age of 13 ("Child" or "Children").&nbsp; Ubisoft restricts access to certain Services  on age grounds and, in certain jurisdictions, for certain Services and  functions, asks for parent approval when a Child wishes to register for the  Services.&nbsp; </p>
<p>When we intend to collect personal information from  a Child, we take additional steps to protect children's privacy, including: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Notifying parents about our information  practices with regard to Children, including the types of personal information  we may collect from Children, the uses to which we may put that information,  and whether and with whom we may share that information </li>
  <li>In accordance with applicable law, obtaining  consent from parents for the collection of personal information from their  Children, or for sending information about our products and services directly  to their Children </li>
  <li>Limiting our collection of personal information  from Children to no more than is reasonably necessary to participate in an  online activity </li>
  <li>Giving parents access or the ability to request  access to personal information we have collected from their Children and the  ability to request that the personal information be changed or deleted </li>
</ul>
<p>More specifically, when a Child under the age of 13  registers, (s)he must supply the e-mail address of a parent or legal guardian  who will be contacted by Ubisoft to ask him/her to confirm, refuse to modify  his/her Minor's registration. Ubisoft reserves the right to limit the period  during which a child under the age of 13 may play pending confirmation and  activation by his/her parent or guardian.&nbsp;  Ubisoft reserves the right to ask for written proof of parental consent  for any user or potential user of the services suspected to be a Child.&nbsp; Parental consent applies exclusively to the  specific service for which it has been granted.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Certain Services are specifically designed for  Children and enable Children under the age of 13 to create their own free  accounts for which Ubisoft collects their username, password, date of birth (or  age), country, and parent or guardian's e-mail address.&nbsp; <strong></strong></p><strong>
<p>Such services sometimes offer the possibility of  paying for a subscription or certain game functions which enable Children to  participate in more activies on the Services by making a payment.&nbsp; The subscription services may also allow  parents or guardians to manage their Child's account and create their own  player accounts.&nbsp; <strong></strong></p><strong>
<p>Certain services enable Children to create  personalized avatars which they can use in numerous activies in the services,  including mini-games and virtual worlds.&nbsp;  Children may also use other functions of the Services such as "Recommend  to a friend" to invite a friend to find out about the servies.&nbsp; The "Recommend to a friend" functions enable  Children to send their friends a single message inviting them to visit the  related service.&nbsp; Ubisoft will collect  the first name and e-mail address of your Child (or, failing that, the e-mail  address of the parent or guardian) and the e-mail address of his/her friend for  the sole purpose of sending a single message.&nbsp;  This information is neither stored nor used for any other purpose and we  do not reveal your child's e-mail address to the recipient.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Parents may delete their Child's Account or change  their Child's privacy settings at any time by creating a parental Account or by  sending an e-mail to the administrator of the Privacy Policy, who is identified  below.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In all cases, use of the Services by Children must  take place under the responsibility of their parents or legal guardians and any  use of the Services is assumed to have been validated by them.&nbsp; AS FAR AS IS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE  LEGISLATION, UBISOFT DECLINES ANY RESPONSIBILITY REGARDING ANY ACTIVITIES WHICH  MAY BE CONDUCTED BY CHILDREN WITHOUT THE PERMISSION OF THEIR PARENTS OR LEGAL  GUARDIANS.</p>
<p>IF YOU ARE A PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN AND YOU GIVE  YOUR PERMISSION FOR YOUR CHILD TO REGISTER FOR ONE OR OTHER OF THE SERVICES,  YOU THEREBY AGREE TO THE TERMS RELATING TO USE OF THE SERVICES BY YOUR  CHILD.&nbsp; </p>
<p id="pp6"><strong>Q6.&nbsp; Does  this privacy policy apply to other websites linked to this Site?</strong></p>
<p>A6.&nbsp; The  services may contain links to other websites.&nbsp;  For instance, purchases of Virtual Currency or Virtual Items for Ubisoft  Services may be transacted on a third party processors site.&nbsp; Any personal information you provide on  linked pages or applications is provided directly to that third party and is  subject to that third party's privacy policy.&nbsp;  This Privacy Policy does not apply to such linked sites, and we are not  responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of  these websites or any other sites that are linked to or from the Services.&nbsp; We encourage you to learn about their privacy  and security practices and policies before providing them with personal  information.&nbsp; </p>
<p id="pp7"><strong>Q7.&nbsp; What  kinds of security measures do we take to safeguard your personally identifiable  information?&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>A7.&nbsp; The  security and confidentiality of your personal information is extremely  important to us. We have implemented technical, administrative, and physical  security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access  and improper use. From time to time, we review our security procedures to  consider appropriate new technology and methods. However, please understand  that, despite our best efforts, no security measure is perfect or  impenetrable.&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>To protect the confidentiality of personal  information maintained in your account, you must keep your password  confidential and not disclose it to any other person.&nbsp; You are responsible for all uses of the  Services by any person using your password.&nbsp;  Please advise us immediately if you believe your password has been  misused.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;DESPITE OUR  EFFORTS TO KEEP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION SECURE, NO COMPANY CAN GUARANTY THE  SECURITY AND PRIVACY OF ITS SERVICES, INFORMATION AND OTHER DATA.&nbsp; ACCORDINGLY, UBISOFT DISCLAIMS AND DOES NOT  REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT IT WILL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN YOUR PRIVACY OR THE  SECURITY OF ITS DATA IN REGARD TO YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.&nbsp; OUR PRIVACY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ARE "AS  IS" AND UBISOFT MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS AS TO THE FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR  PURPOSE OR MERCHANTABILITY.&nbsp; </p>
<p id="pp8"><strong>Q8.&nbsp; How  can you update your personal information and profile?&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>A8.&nbsp; You can  access and update the contact information you gave us during registration (that  is, your e-mail address or any other information that would directly enable us  to contact you), by logging in and clicking the Edit Profile section, or  contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@ubisoft.com">privacy@ubisoft.com</a>.&nbsp;In  your email, please include the name of the website you used to register so we  can verify your request. </p>
<p>If you do not wish to receive promotional e-mails,  texts, or other communications from Ubisoft, please follow one of the two  options below:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must opt-out to receive promotional  e-mails, texts, or other communications.&nbsp;  When providing your personal information, simply uncheck the box that  asks whether you would like to receive such communications, and we will not  send you any promotional information via these communications methods.&nbsp; </p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you receive an e-mail, text, or  other communications from us, it will contain a link or other instruction that  allows you to stop the delivery of such messages from us.&nbsp; If you decide to use this opt-out method, you  will no longer receive special offers, valuable coupons, new product  introductions or e-newsletters from Ubisoft; however, you will continue to  receive non-promotional communications from us, such as order  confirmations.&nbsp; </p>
