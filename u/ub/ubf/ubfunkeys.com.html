                          <p>Mattel adheres to the Children's Online Privacy Protection  Act of 1998 and the guidelines of the Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU)  of the Council of Better Business Bureaus, Inc. in each of our websites for  children. &nbsp;You can help by spending time  online with your children and monitoring your children's online use. Please  help us protect your child's privacy by instructing them never to provide  personal information on this site or any other without your permission.</p>
                          <p>If you are under 18, please be sure to read this policy with  your parents or legal guardians and ask questions about things you do not  understand. Children under 13 should get your parent's or legal guardian’s  permission before giving out your e-mail address or any personal information to  Mattel or to anyone else on the Internet.</p>
                          <p><strong>1. Does Mattel Collect Any Personal Information About Me  If I'm 13 Or Older?</strong><br>
                            Mattel doesn't require anyone to share any personal  information about themselves in order to enjoy any of our websites.&nbsp; That means you can visit our sites without  any need to register with us. However, most of our sites contain special  sections and privileges for members that register. We do not collect any  personal information from you or your teenager unless it is voluntarily  provided, for instance when signing a guest book, registering for contests,  downloads, or free demos, completing our online customer surveys or purchasing  products. The personal information we ask for is usually first and last name, mailing  address, phone number and an e-mail address. See below for how we use this  information. Remember, only people who are 18 or older may purchase products  from our online stores.</p>
                          <p><strong>2. What Ordering Information Does Mattel Collect In Our Online Stores?</strong><br>
                          We may offer opportunities to purchase products in our  online stores.&nbsp; Customers must be over  the age of 18 with a valid credit card.&nbsp;  Visitors under 18 can use the Wish List function while browsing our  online stores but cannot make purchases.&nbsp;  When a customer places an order or requests a catalogue online, we  collect information associated with the transaction, which will include the  customer’s name, mailing address, products ordered, shipping address, and  credit card information.&nbsp; We ask for this  information so that we may fulfill the order or catalogue request.&nbsp; We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology  to protect credit card data during transmission to our website, and adopt  careful internal procedures to safeguard this information in our system.</p>
                          <p>Customers have the option of registering certain information  for future orders while completing their online order.&nbsp; For the customers who choose to register, we  will capture their login name, password, name and mailing address, alternate  ship-to addresses, and credit card information.&nbsp; <br>
                            When registered customers return to the site to place  subsequent orders, they can identify themselves with their login name and  password.&nbsp; If a customer includes a  child’s birth date and e-mail address, this information will only be used to  help us provide products and services that meet customer needs.</p>
                          <p>When a customer places an order online, we will send a  confirming e-mail message.&nbsp; We may also  send an occasional e-mail featuring a special promotion or product that may be  of interest to customers.&nbsp; Any customer  who prefers not to receive an online order confirmation or promotional e-mail  should indicate this preference on the online store order form.&nbsp; If you do receive an e-mail from us that you  would rather not receive, simply follow the “unsubscribe” instructions included  in the e-mail.</p>
                          <p><strong>3. Does Mattel</strong> <strong>Collect Any Personal Information  About Anyone Under 13?</strong><br>
                            We do not collect personal information online from children  under 13 without consent of a parent or legal guardian except in special,  limited circumstances. If your child is under 13 and wants to use our sites  with special activities, like scavenger hunts, personalized pages, games or  clubs, we might ask your child to “register.” They can often do so anonymously  by just providing a user name and password, but sometimes we need their first  name and e-mail address. When we ask for your child's first name, your child is  encouraged to use a "screen name" (not their real name) that only  they know. Sometimes we will ask your child to make up a special password so  that only they can see their customized areas on the site. With your verifiable  consent, we may collect personal information from your child such as a last  name, address or e-mail address when the information is necessary for a  particular activity. If we need more than just your child's first name (or  screen name) and e-mail address for your child to participate in a particular  online activity, we will ask your child for your e-mail or mailing address so  that we can notify you of your child's request and get your permission. When we  ask for your permission, we will tell you what we will do with the information  you or your child provides us, and we will tell you how you can review your  child's information and ask us to delete the information. We don't keep your  (or your child's) e-mail address unless you tell us it is okay.</p>
                          <p>Mattel might collect an e-mail address and first name (or  screen name) from your child under 13 without your consent, but only in the  following special cases:</p>
                          <p>If a child under 13 sends a request  to us, we keep their e-mail address for long enough to respond to them. Mattel  deletes this information from our system after we answer their question.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
                            If a child under 13 signs up for an  e-mail newsletter, or other activity that requires multiple online contacts  with the child, we also ask the child for a parent's or legal guardian’s e-mail  address so we can notify you and give you an opportunity to opt out.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
                            Occasionally, Mattel has special  site activities or promotions like sweepstakes or contests that are open to  children even if they are under 13. In these activities, we are not allowed to  ask for more information from your child than what is necessary for your child  to participate in the activity. </p>
                          <p>In the latter situation we require your child to give us  your e-mail address, too, so that we can tell you that they have registered in  a promotion or for a service. If we need more than an e-mail address and first  name (or screen name) to enter your child in the promotion or offer the  service, we will notify you, explain what information we need and why, and  generally ask that you (not your child) provide it. For instance, we might ask  you for your mailing address so that we can send to you, for your child, any prizes  your child wins, or for your telephone number so that we can tell you when your  child has won. Any information you or your child give us in the above special  circumstances will be deleted from our database once the promotion, program or  activity is concluded, and after any legally required period for keeping such  information is complete.<br>
                            We do not require a child to disclose more information than  is reasonably necessary to participate in a contest, game or other activity as  a condition of participation. If you no longer wish your child to participate  in an e-mail newsletter, simply click on the link that is provided for removal  or contact us at <a href="mailto:Service@mattel.com">Service@mattel.com</a>.&nbsp; Upon proper identification, parents or legal  guardians may review the personal information we have collected about their  child, request deletion, or refuse to allow further collection or use of the  information.&nbsp; Click <strong>here</strong> <em>[insert  link]</em> to print a copy of our Personal Information Review Access Request,  fill it out completely and mail it to:</p>

                          <p>However, if you ask us to delete your child's information,  we may have to ask your child not to participate in our activities.</p>
                          <p><strong>4. What Does Mattel Do With The Information We Collect?</strong><br>
                            We use the personal information we collect for the purposes  indicated at the time you or your teenager or child (with your consent) provides  such information. For instance, if you register in a contest, we will use the  registration information to notify contest winners, or if you purchase a  product, we will use the information to fulfill the order. Occasionally, and  only with consent at the time we ask for information, we might also e-mail or  mail you or your teenager or your child to provide information on upcoming  Mattel products, website updates and promotions. With your consent, we may also  share information with other Mattel brands and Mattel family companies so that  they can let you and your family know about products that might be of interest.  If you want to stop receiving such updates and product information at any time,  just contact us at <a href="mailto:Service@mattel.com">Service@mattel.com</a> or call us at 800-524-TOYS. Our mailings and e-mail will also include  information allowing you to ask not to receive such information in the future.</p>
                          <p><strong>5. Does Mattel Share Information About Me With Others?</strong><br>
                            If you consent, Mattel may provide your information to outside companies that  offer products or services that may be of interest, and if your teenager 13 or  older consents, we may likewise provide their information. Except as described  in this policy, we never share personal information that we receive online from  children under 13 with other companies outside Mattel.&nbsp; We will remove your name from the list we  provide to outside companies if you contact us at <a href="mailto:Service@mattel.com">Service@mattel.com</a> or call us at 800-524-TOYS,  and we will do the same for your teenager's name if they request removal. In  special circumstances, Mattel may give other companies access to our  information database, but only if necessary to allow them to provide database  or server maintenance or security, help us process and fulfill orders or  requests, or provide other similar services to Mattel. If we do provide access,  we require those other companies to sign confidentiality agreements promising  to keep secret any information they see. If Mattel believes that anyone's  behavior on our sites may damage us or our sites or anyone else, we may  disclose the relevant personal information in order to prevent this harm. In  that case, we might try to identify the wrongdoer, contact them or bring legal  action against them. We may also disclose personal information if we believe  that the disclosure is required by law, or in response to a legal request.</p>
                          <p><strong>6. How Does Mattel Use Cookies?</strong><br>
                            A "cookie" is a small file that we save on your computer’s hard drive  that contains non-personal information. Our cookies help to give you faster  access to pages you have already visited; they allow you to personalize your  pages and us to customize our offerings; and they help you to participate in  some activities or events on the site. For instance, some of our sites have  scavenger or treasure hunts, and we need to use cookies to keep track of your  progress. If you leave the site and then return, cookies will tell us what  things you have already collected so that you do not have to start all over  again. Cookies keep track of items in your shopping cart and wish list in our  online stores. We also use cookies to help us figure out how many people visit  our sites, which of our Web pages they stop at and how long they stay there. This  information helps us figure out which of our Web features are successes and  what sites might need improvement. For administrative purposes, we collect IP  addresses, which is the automatic number assigned to your computer when you  surf the Web. Certain Internet Service Providers may assign the same IP address  to many users.&nbsp; The IP address allows us  to count the total number of "hits" on our sites. However, your IP  address and cookie are not connected to any personally identifiable or online  contact information like a name and address, so you and your family remain  anonymous. We also use other technology, called clear GIFs, to provide us with  other important anonymous information, such as when an e-mail has been opened.</p>
                          <p><strong>7. Does Mattel Ever Collect Information Without Consent?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                            Mattel does not collect information passively through  cookies or other tracking mechanisms except in the circumstances described  above. Cookies DON'T contain any personal information about a specific user. We  don't use cookies or other non-consensual methods to take personally  identifiable or online contact information about you or your family off of your  computer. Except for certain activities like treasure hunts, which we talked  about above, Mattel doesn't use cookies for direct marketing or promotional  purposes. Cookies are also not used to collect information specifically about  you or your family for sharing with third parties.</p>
                          <p><strong>8. Do Mattel’s Third-Party Advertisers Use Cookies?</strong><br>
                          In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our  third-party advertisers may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.</p>
                          <p><strong>And finally…</strong><br>
                          We want you and your family to have fun surfing all our  sites and urge you and your family to follow common sense whenever disclosing  personal information - on this site or anywhere on the Internet.</p>
                          <p>Thanks for reading our privacy policy.&nbsp; We hope you have a better understanding of  the many activities offered on our websites and the ways in which we really are  committed to safeguarding online privacy. Remember, we may change our policy  from time to time. When this happens we will notify you of the new policy by  posting it on our sites.</p>
                          <p>If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact  us!</p>
