# Privacy and Cookie Policy | UBM

## Welcome to UBM plc’s website.

UBM plc is a global business-to-business marketing services and communications company, with a primary focus on events.  We help businesses do business by connecting customers with a targeted, qualified audience, through live events, press releases and other digital and print media.

We are committed to the privacy of everyone who accesses this website or provides us data about themselves. Under the Data Protection Act 1998, we must comply with certain requirements which are designed to ensure that any data you provide to us is processed with due care and attention.  We publish this Privacy Policy to let you know how we meet that commitment.

We publish this Policy to let you know how we collect and use data about you through this website and related investor relations activities.  Please note that we do business globally through a number of UBM subsidiaries.  Those companies may collect and use data about you in ways quite different than this website and so, will publish separate privacy policies to reflect their practices.  Each will publish the applicable policy either in the footer of its websites or on registration pages and we encourage you to look to those policies for further information. 

## Information That Identifies You

You may visit this website without our collecting any information which identities you as an individual.  

We only collect information that identifies you, for example, your name, company and business contact data, when you choose to give it to us.  For example, if you contact us directly by email or phone with questions or comments or sign up for an investor webcast, then we use that data to provide the information you request and to follow up with you.

## Cookies and Automatic Data Collection Technologies

A cookie is a small file of information which is stored on your computer. That cookie then communicates with servers, ours or those of other companies that we authorise to collect data for us, and allows recognition of your personal computer or other device you are using to access this website.

We use cookies on this website only to collect aggregate information about the number of visitors and pages visited.  These cookies do not identify you as an individual.

Most modern browsers offer you ways to control or block cookies.  These browser controls will usually be found in the “options” or “preferences” menu in your toolbar.  The “help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to stop or manage cookies.  More information is available here, [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

## Security

We use reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect personal information we have about you against theft, loss or misuse. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you submit to us.

## Other Important Information

We may process information you give us about yourself anywhere globally.  We may transfer that information to one of our subsidiaries if we believe that any question you have is best answered by that subsidiary. 

We may change the provisions of this Policy from time to time and urge you to check back here periodically.  Your continued use of any of the websites or pages within the scope of this policy will be your consent to the practices described in the version of the policy in place at the time of your visit.

UBM plc, a company registered in Jersey with a company number 100460 serves as controller for this website and for any personal data you submit directly to us through it. Our registered office is at 240 Blackfriars Road, London, SE1 8BF.
