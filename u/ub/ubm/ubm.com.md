Cookies

We use cookies and similar technologies on our web sites to improve performance and make your experience better. Your use of our web sites indicates your consent to the cookies described in this policy. Please see HOW YOU CAN CONTROL COOKIES, below, for more information on how to withdraw your consent at any time. 

## WHAT ARE COOKIES?

A web cookie, a commonly used data collection technology, is simply a piece of text which can be placed on the browser of your personal computer or mobile device and subsequently read as you visit a web site. A cookie may be a session cookie, that is, a cookie that remains on your browser while you are logged on to a particular web site and then disappears when you close your browser, or it may be a persistent cookie, a cookie that remains on your browser over a period of time. Information from a cookie may be collected and used in aggregate form Or data may be collected into an individual profile or record. That individual record may either be unique but anonymous, or the profile can be linked with information that identifies you as an individual.

You can learn more about cookies, generally, at 

[www.allaboutcookies.org](http://privacypolicy.ubm.com/cookiepolicy/www.allaboutcookies.org)

## HOW DO WE USE COOKIES?

We may use cookies for a number of purposes: 

### 1\. Essential cookies

We may use a limited number of cookies essential to particular services you have requested or for security purposes. A few of our sites use a cookie for a shopping cart function when you purchase services or offerings. In particular, if you have registered for a site or use a customer portal we may use a cookie to authenticate the pc or mobile device that you are using. 

### 2\. Performance cookies

We allow third parties to set analytics, or performance, cookies to collect and report aggregate information. These cookies provide reporting to us on an aggregate basis and so, do not identify you at all. We use the aggregate reports to understand how our web sites are used and improve their usefulness to our audiences. 

### 3\. Functional cookies

A number of cookies also support how our web sites function, identifying your pc or end device on a unique but anonymous basis. These cookies may, for example, remember your language preferences or recognize an individual’s activity within a single session.

If you register for a site, we use a cookie to associate your presence with a specific user name and password or account. We may use a persistent cookie to recognize you automatically each time you return, but only if you ask us to do so. We may also use cookies to prepopulate your login or forms you fill out on the site with information you have already provided.

We may conduct analyses of user traffic to measure the use of our sites and to improve the content of our web sites and our services. These analyses will be performed through the use of IP addresses and cookies.

We use web beacons and pixels in our emails to track delivery and open rates. Our email provider delivers cookies with our email to recognise a user’s response. The results are stored and reported on against the individual’s email address and the account profile within our database. 

## THIRD PARTY COOKIES AND ADVERTISING ON OUR SITES

We allow third party advertisers to show you advertising on our sites. Third party ad servers may use cookies to control certain routine advertising concerns such as making sure that you do not see the same ad too many times or that the ads are shown in the format best suited for your browser. Advertising may also be targeted: You may be shown ads based on certain demographic information which we provide, for example, the size of the company you work for or your professional responsibilities. Advertisers may also use third party ad servers to target you based on an anonymous but unique profile on your online behavior across a number of unaffiliated websites, a method known as online behavioral advertising. Advertisers may even place their own cookies on our sites. You can find more information about each ad server’s practices by reviewing its privacy policies, for our sites, [DoubleClick](http://support.google.com/dfp_premium/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=2551880)  and [Google AdSense](http://support.google.com/adsense/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1348695) or visiting [www.youronlinechoices.uk](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/).

We may use certain demographic information to enable third party ad servers (see below) to show you ads based on information about you in your business capacity, for example, your title within a company or the size of that company.

Finally, we ask both ad servers, DoubleClick and Google AdSense, to use their cookies on our sites to identify you as you leave and then to show you one of our own ads later, as you visit another site. This relatively simple process is known as re-targeting. 

## HOW YOU CAN CONTROL COOKIES

The cookies we use or allow are an accepted part of ecommerce and important to your use of our web sites. Performance cookies allow us to understand our audiences as a whole and improve how our sites meet your needs and expectations. Many of the functional cookies are basic to how our sites and services work. The cookies we use for registration allow us to conduct our business online. Our sites and services, or parts of them, may not work properly without these cookies. 

### 1\. Browser controls

Most modern browsers offer you ways to control or block cookies. These browser controls will usually be found in the “options’ or “preferences” menu. For more help, you may take a look at the “Help” settings or review these website for more details - [http://www.aboutcookies.org/Default.aspx?page=1](http://www.aboutcookies.org/Default.aspx?page=1)

### 2\. Ad cookies and targeting

You can find more information or turn off targeting by member companies at YourOnlineChoices UK, [http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk).

Transfers of personal information

We may share your personal information with any member of the UBM group of companies, including subsidiaries and holding companies, in order to enable you to access the services, provide you with customer support and conduct the other activities described in this privacy policy. Such group companies may be located outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"), in which case the section "Where we store your data" below will apply.

We use other companies, agents or contractors ("Service Providers") to perform services on our behalf or to assist us with the provision of services to you. For example, we may engage Service Providers to provide market research, marketing (including competitions), advertising, communications, event management (including logistics, health and safety and audio-visual services), meetings and bookings (including accommodation), training, IT, hosting and other infrastructure, subscription and discount management, payment processing, and data cleansing and processing services. In the course of providing such services, these Service Providers may have access to your personal information. These third parties are contractually bound only to use personal information to perform the services that we hire them to provide. We will always use our best efforts to ensure that all the Service Providers we work with will keep your personal data secure.

We may also disclose your personal information to third parties:

in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets;

if any member of the UBM group or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data about its customers will be one of the transferred assets; and

if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation or in order to enforce our terms and conditions or other agreements, or to protect the rights, property or safety of the UBM group.

If you use one of our virtual products, e.g. Virtual Exhibitions, Directory Sites, Webinars etc., or choose to allow your badge to be scanned at an event, we may pass the information you provide to third parties. Generally this will be via a process whereby you, as the user, visit or interact with a third party e.g. visit a stand at an online exhibition, have your badge scanned or click on an asset branded and provided by a third party. In some instances, for example, a products listing site, you may reach out directly to a supplier or exhibitor who may contact you in return. In other instances our virtual products are sponsored and, in such cases the data you provided to us will be given to the sponsor. Generally, we will let you know at the time of collection if a product is sponsored. If you wish to change your contact preferences with an individual exhibitor/sponsor, please follow their own unsubscribe request details.  Unsubscribing with UBM (UK) Ltd will stop [UBM (UK) Ltd] from contacting you in the future, but not the individual third parties whom you have interacted with independently. 

Where we store your data

The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the EEA. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the provision of services to you or the processing of your payment details. We will take all steps that are mandatory or reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy and applicable data protection laws, including, where relevant, entering into EU standard contractual clauses (or equivalent measures) with the party outside the EEA receiving the data.

Security of personal information

We use administrative, technical, and physical measures to safeguard personal information against loss, theft and unauthorised uses, access or modifications. 

Certain areas of our websites may be password protected. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.  We ask you not to share your password(s) with anyone. 

Payments made via our websites are processed in a secure environment using software provided by third party providers. 

Third party websites and apps

Our websites may contain links to and from third party websites and we may provide you with details of apps provided by third parties.  Please note that if you follow a link to any of these websites or download an app, these websites and apps will have their own terms of use and privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility of liability for these policies.  Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites or apps.

You have the right to ask us to stop processing your data, even where that processing is necessary for our legitimate interests (for example, where the processing is necessary for the legitimate commercial objectives we pursue in the course of our business), including the profiling we undertake to send you personalised offers, product recommendations and similar content.  You also have the right to object to any results of a processing activity that prejudice your rights and that are conducted exclusively through automated systems.

You also have the right to ask us to stop processing your data for direct marketing purposes, including any profiling we undertake for the purposes of direct marketing.  We will in any case only send you marketing communications if you have previously agreed to this, but if you change your mind you can easily unsubscribe from our marketing communications at any time by following the instructions included in these marketing communications.

If you had previously opted in, your personal data will cease to be transmitted to our partners from the time your request is processed. 

Your right to have your data transmitted to another organisation
