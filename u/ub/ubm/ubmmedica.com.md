**PRIVACY STATEMENT** **  
****UBM MEDICA LLC  
**_Effective: June 11, 2012_

UBM Medica LLC ("UBM Medica") offers conferences, medical information, and related offerings to medical professionals. We publish this privacy policy to let you know what data we collect about you as an individual professional, how we use that data, and what choices you have. 

This privacy policy covers all "personal" data we collect about you from face to face and virtual conferences and meetings, websites, email campaigns, and print publications. "Personal" data means data which identifies you as an individual and reflects your individual use of our products and services. It is data about you as a medical professional. Please note that a separate privacy policy covers our websites directed to consumers. If you are uncertain about which privacy policy applies to a particular website or web page, consult the privacy link at the bottom of the web page.

Please note that you may choose to publish your personal information and your views in various of our online venues, for example, online communities, forums or virtual events. This Policy does not protect your public disclosures.

**Information We Collect About You** **  
** We collect the following data about you:

  * Information you give us about yourself, including data about your professional credentials and practice, when you register for or subscribe to any of our events, services or resources, register with us through a UBM Medica Network site or contact us directly. We may use medical or other databases to update or complete certain information about you. 
  * If you are a medical doctor, we may ask the American Medical Association to verify your medical credentials. For more information about the AMA's own privacy practices, please click <http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/footer/privacy-policy.shtml>. 
  * Once you register we create an account for you, adding data about how you use and interact with our events, products, services, resources and email campaigns. 



We also use common Internet data collection technologies to collect data: We use "cookies" and associated web beacons. A cookie is simply a piece of code which is placed on your personal computer to recognize the computer as it accesses our websites. Many cookies are not "personal" cookies in that they are not associated with you as an identified individual. 

  * We recognize or verify who is accessing our websites or content areas that require registration and so, may place "personal" cookies on your pc. We may also use this cookie to understand your interests and put you in touch with third parties that we expect will have additional information relevant to your interests. 
  * Some but not all of our websites include online advertising. Cookies are also used to serve such advertising or content. We may display ads on our own sites on a personally identifiable basis. We allow other companies, called third party ad servers, to serve ads that appear on our sites as well. Please see the information under ["Your Choices"](http://imaging.ubmmedica.com/all/UBMMedica_Privacy_Statement.html#choices) for details about online advertising. 



Finally, we collect log data, including IP, or Internet Protocol, addresses used to access our websites, and other routine information about your browser and pc capabilities. We use this data to administer our systems. We or third party ad servers may use the information to limit the number of times you see a particular ad, to target information or ads on a geographic basis or to display ads in the format best matched to your pc's capabilities. We do not associate this log and technical capabilities data with your account in the routine course of our business.

**How We Use Information About You** **  
** Our primary business is to organize events and communities and provide respected information for medical professionals. We use data about you as an individual medical professional to:

  * Provide the events, services, and resources you request and manage your account. 
  * Manage the services, particularly registration for certain websites, that require us to know who you are when you are online. 
  * Display or deliver content, ours and other companies’, to you based on your professional needs and interests. 
  * Contact you by email and postal mail about offerings from our business partners directed to your professional interests and areas of specialization. Please note that these emails may list either us or the partner in the "from" line. In either case, your name and contact information are not disclosed to the partner unless and until you contact or respond to the partner directly. 
  * Invite you to participate in surveys and professional discussions. 
  * Virtual Trade Shows: The platforms that UBM Medica uses to provide virtual trade shows will place a session cookie on your personal computer when you register for the event. We connect this session cookie with the registration information you provide to us for the event. The cookie is used to manage participation in the event, for certain other purposes, including if you choose to participate in our contests, and to track your visits if you choose to visit exhibitors’ booths or special sponsored sessions. If you disable or delete the session cookie, you will be bounced from the event. UBM Medica may also pass your registration data to any exhibitor if you visit that exhibitor's booth or sponsored section.

These communities provide privacy controls so that you can control how much of your profile and other information to make public or to share with others within the community. As a professional, you remain responsible for locating the privacy controls (usually available on the page from which you can edit your profile), understanding how those controls, including default settings, work and protecting the information you provide.

Some but not all of our websites include online ads served by third parties. We do not control the cookies that other companies and their third party ad servers use to display ads to you on our websites. 

  * We currently allow the following third party ad servers to place those ads: DoubleClick ([www.doubleclick.com/privacy/index.aspx](http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/index.aspx)), Atlas ([www.atlassolutions.com/privacy.aspx](http://www.atlassolutions.com/privacy.aspx)), MediaPlex ([www.mediaplex.com/mojo_privacy_statement.shtml](http://www.mediaplex.com/mojo_privacy_statement.shtml)), Pointroll ([www.pointroll.com/privacy-policy.aspx](http://www.pointroll.com/privacy-policy.aspx)), Eyeblaster ([www.eyeblaster.com/Content.aspx?page=privacy_policy](http://www.eyeblaster.com/Content.aspx?page=privacy_policy)), and Bizo ([www.bizo.com/business_audience/privacy_policy](http://www.bizo.com/business_audience/privacy_policy)).

Online advertising technologies and practices, including behavioral advertising, are evolving. We may add to this list of third party servers from time to time without changing the effective date on this policy. Please check here periodically.
