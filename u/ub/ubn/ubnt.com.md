### 1\. Information Collected By Ubiquiti

**User Provided Information.** When using our Services, you may provide to Ubiquiti certain information by which someone could personally identify you such as your name, email address, mailing address, or other contact information ("Personally Identifiable Information"), as well as information about yourself such as your power usage, browser type, webpages of our Services that you access, or Internet Protocol address, by which someone could not personally identify you ("Non-Personally Identifiable Information").

**Usage Data.** As described in this section, we may automatically collect certain information when you use our devices and other Services ("Usage Data"). Usage Data includes any information that your devices and web browser send to our servers automatically. The Usage Data that we collect may include information such as your device data, sensor data, device signals, device parameters, device identifiers that may uniquely identify your devices, web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform type, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your devices or browser. In addition, we may automatically collect location information (including latitude and longitude), performance data, motion data, temperature data, power usage data, and any data or signals collected by the devices as part of the Usage Data. We do not collect the contents of any communications that pass through our devices or Services.

### 2\. The Way Ubiquiti Uses Information

In general we use the information we collect related to the Services as follows:

  * **Providing the Services.** We may use your Personally Identifiable Information, Non-Personally Identifiable Information and Usage Data (together, “User Information”) to operate, maintain, and provide the features and functionality of a Service and for related business purposes.
  * **Communicating with You.** We may use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send you marketing emails. You may opt out of such marketing messages by following the opt out instructions in any marketing email we send you. Even if you opt out of marketing emails we may still use your email address to send you non-marketing or administrative emails, such as to notify you of important changes to our Services or policies or for customer service purposes.
  * **Services for Wireless Network Providers.** Some of the Usage Data that we may collect may be on behalf of your internet service provider who may access and use this information for their purposes under their agreement with you. Use of this Usage Data by these third parties is not subject to this privacy policy.
  * **Other Business Uses.** We also may use your User Information to (1) to understand how users access and use our Services on an aggregate and individualized basis, to improve the quality and design of our Services, and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing user preferences and trends; (2) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you use our Services; (3) provide custom, personalized content and information; (4) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; (5) track your use of our Services; (6) provide custom, personalized data analysis; and (7) for our other lawful business, and commercial reasons.



### 3\. How Ubiquiti May Disclose Information

We may disclose the information we collect related to the Services as follows:

  * **Public Information.** When you submit or post information in the discussion and public areas of our Services, certain User Information (such as your username, number of posts, and reputation and avatar information) will be shared with other users of the Services or with the general public. You may, by using applicable parts of the Services, publically share your User Information, including Personally Identifiable Information. Please see "Public Information" below.
  * **Usage Data.** We may provide Usage Data to our customers, in connection with the Services which those customers use. For example, our customers may include network providers or operators; we may disclose Usage Data to these customers in connection with the products and devices that are deployed over these customers’ networks. The treatment of Usage Data by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies, and not this one. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of those third parties.
  * **Aggregate or De-identified Data.** We may share Non-Personally Identifiable Information, including Usage Data (such as anonymous or aggregate user usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, etc.), with certain third parties to assist such third parties in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, and/or functionality with respect to our Services. We may also share aggregate or de-identified information about users with third parties for marketing, research, or similar purposes.
  * **Business Transfers.** If we are acquired by or merged with another company, or if substantially all of the assets of one of our business activities are transferred to another company, we may transfer the information we have collected from you to the other company.
  * **Other Disclosures.** We may also disclose User Information (1) if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is in compliance with state and federal laws (including, without limitation, copyright laws) or in response to a court order, subpoena, legal process or search warrant; (2) if we believe, in good faith, such action is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Service or any terms applicable to specific Services, exercise our legal rights, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our Services, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Ubiquiti, our users or others; (3) to any parent company, affiliated entity, or other entity controlled by, controlling, or under common control with, us (in which case, we will require such entities to honor this Privacy Policy); or (4) as otherwise described herein.



### 4\. Cookies and Other Tracking Technology

We may use cookies, web beacons, local stored objects (LSOs), java script and similar technology in connection with your use of some of our Services, including our website and mobile applications, to collect Usage Data and other analytics data. We may also permit third parties to use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect usage and analytics data on our site and mobile app. In addition, some of our Services may use analytic software (which may be provided by third parties) to collect further Usage Data regarding the usage patterns of our users. We may combine Usage Data with the other information we collect (including Personally Identifiable Information), which could enable us to trace Usage Data to an individual user.

**Cookies.** Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that are transferred to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities while using our Services. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them. The “Help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable or delete cookies altogether. Some features of the Services may not function with cookies disabled.

**Local Storage Objects.** We may use Local Storage Objects ("LSOs"), including Flash LSOs, to store your preferences and to personalize your visit to our site and use of our Services. LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored. Typically, you cannot control, delete, or disable the acceptance of LSOs through your web browser. For more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash LSOs, go to the Adobe Flash Player Help Page, choose "Global Storage Settings Panel" and follow the instructions.

**Web Beacons.** Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use web beacons (a.k.a., clear GIFs, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our website and mobile application to, among other things, track the activities of users, help us manage content, and compile statistics about usage. We and our third-party service providers may also use web beacons in HTML emails to our customers, to help track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.

**Third Party Tracking.** Our website currently does not honor “Do Not Track” browser signals. However, we do not track user movements across our site and third party sites, nor do we permit third parties to track Personally Identifiable Information about users across our website and third party sites.

**Ad Networks.** We may use third parties, such as network advertisers, to display advertisements on third-party websites and mobile apps, on our behalf. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your use of our Services and other third-party website and mobile applications. This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements by displaying ads for products and services in which you might be interested. These third parties may use cookies and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide third-party advertisers with aggregate or de-identified information about your usage of our Services. We do not share your Personally Identifiable Information with these third parties, and we do not permit these third parties to use cookies and other tracking technologies placed on our Site to automatically collect Personally Identifiable Information about users.

You may opt out of many website third-party ad networks, including those operated by members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") and the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA"). For more information regarding this practice by NAI members and DAA members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including how to opt out of third-party ad networks operated by NAI and DAA members, please visit their respective websites:  
[www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp](http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp) (NAI) and [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices) (DAA). Opting out of one or more NAI member or DAA member networks (many of which will be the same) only means that those members will no longer deliver targeted content or ads to you. It does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit the opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your opt-out may no longer be effective.

### 5\. Your Choices

**Marketing Communications.** You may opt out of receiving marketing emails from us by following the opt-out instructions contained in any marketing email we send you. Please note that it may take up to 10 business days for us to process opt-out requests. If you opt out of receiving marketing emails from us, we may still send you emails about your account or any Services you have requested or received from us.

**Profile Information.** You may modify your profile information by logging into your account and updating your information. Please note that copies of information that you have updated, modified, or deleted may remain in our systems, and may also be viewable in cached and archived pages of our website for a period of time. Additionally, if you discontinue using our Services or update your profile information, we may retain the data previously collected about you.

Please feel free to contact us, as provided under "Questions, Disputes and Contact Information" below, with any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, your User Information, or your consent to using your User Information.

### 6\. Data Security

We believe that we have implemented commercially reasonable precautions to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Please be aware that despite our efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security. You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your account and the information accessible via your account by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.

### 7\. Third-Party Links 

Our Services may contain links to third-party websites. Any access to and use of such linked websites is not governed by this Policy, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third parties. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third parties.

### 8\. Children's Privacy

We do not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information from children under thirteen (13) years of age, and no part of our Services is directed to children under thirteen (13) years of age. If we learn that Personally Identifiable Information of children under thirteen (13) years of age has been collected on or through our Services, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information from our systems. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under thirteen (13) years of age has provided Personally Identifiable Information to us, then you may alert us at [support@ubnt.com](mailto:support@ubnt.com), ATTN: Privacy Manager, and request that we delete your child’s Personally Identifiable Information from our systems.

### 9\. Special Note to International Users

Most of our website Services are hosted in the United States. If you are accessing our Services from outside of the United States, where laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure differ from United States laws, please be advised that your continued use of our Services may be governed by United States law, this Privacy Policy, and any other terms applicable to our Services. Information about you that we collect or that you submit may be transferred to, processed in, and held in countries other than the one in which you reside (including the United States) and which the European Union and other jurisdictions have deemed do not provide "adequate" protection for personal information. If you are located in a country outside the United States and voluntarily submit User Information to us, you thereby consent to the general use of such information as provided in this Privacy Policy and to the transfer of that User Information to, or storage of that information in, the United States or other locations in which information is stored.

### 10\. California Privacy Rights

If you are a California resident, you may request a list of certain third parties, if any, to which we have disclosed your Personally Identifiable Information for their own direct marketing purposes. You may make one request per calendar year. In your request, please attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for your response. You may request this information in writing by contacting us using the contact information under "Questions, Disputes and Contact Information" below. Please allow up to thirty (30) days for a response.

### 11\. Public Information

Please note that if you choose to share information about yourself in any discussion or public areas of our Services (such as the Community Forum or review boards on the Ubiquiti World Network) we consider that information to be public information. Any personal information that you include in any content submitted or posted when using the public areas of our Services can be viewed by the general public, so please consider this before submitting any such information or content. You are solely responsible for any information, including any Personally Identifiable Information, you disclose on the discussion or public areas of our Services, and any use of such information by any third parties regardless of whether you permitted or did not permit such use. We cannot control how others use the information that you post to public areas of our Services.
