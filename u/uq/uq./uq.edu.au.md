### Google Analytics

The University of Queensland uses [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com.au/analytics/) to gather statistics about how our web content is used, and statistics about our visitors such as their browsers and geographic location. No personally identifying information is collected. 

The information collected includes:

  * which pages are viewed and for how long, including the viewing time and date 
  * the general geographical locations of visitors (as indicated by the network or internet service provider they use), anonymised demographics (age bracket and gender), and the speed of their internet connections 
  * technical information about the computers or devices used to browse pages, including the operating systems, browsers, plug-ins, screen types and default languages. 



To opt out of analytics, you can [ download a browser add-on from Google](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). Alternatively, you can set your browser to refuse or delete cookies from Google Analytics. Check your browser's help information to find out how.

### Other cookies and tracking

We employ a variety of digital tracking and analytics tools, known as cookies and pixel codes, across our public and student-facing websites, online learning systems, apps and social media channels. The data we collect from these tools helps us to better understand our customers and deliver an improved user experience.

Cookies we use may collect the following information about you:

  * IP address, company name inferred from your IP address or DNS, general geographical location inferred from your IP address
  * Technical information about your device, operating system, screen type and browser
  * Date and time of web visits, and web visits session duration
  * How you came to a UQ-page (e.g. from a search engine, direct URL or social media post)
  * Browsing actions, such as completing a form, conducting a search or clicking on a hyperlink
  * Demographic information depending on information you provide or that is available or can be inferred
  * App downloads and in-app activity



We use this information for a variety of purposes, including to:

  * authenticate you to systems and maintain session log-ins
  * manage transactions across multiple webpages
  * improve and streamline your navigation of websites;
  * collect anonymous usage statistics and analytics for a website or system;
  * improve your user experience and track user behaviour on web pages, social media channels and advertisements or when using a UQ app
  * deliver targeted advertising based on website visits and page activity and measure advertising campaign performance
  * create custom audiences in Facebook based on website activity



Each analytics platform and cookie retains data for different periods of time.

We may use pixels and cookies from third parties such as Google and Facebook. For example, for advertising purposes the Facebook network allows UQ to deliver advertising to people who visit our web pages. Please visit [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/terms.php) and [Google](https://policies.google.com/) for more information about the data they collect and use.

If you wish to block Facebook advertising or disable the pixel or cookies while browsing our websites, or using our apps, please consult the help or privacy settings of your device, platform and/or browser.

Please be aware that disabling cookies may adversely impact your user experience, particularly when using UQ’s learning platforms and you might not be able to use some functionality or services.

UQ also uses cookie data for data-matching purposes. If you opt in to receive communications from us e.g. via a sign-up form, the personal information you provide (e.g. your email address) may be matched with previously unidentified aggregated information from your cookies for the purposes of building a contact record so that we can personalise our marketing to you.

#### What is a cookie?

A cookie is a small file placed on your computer or device when you visit a website. On UQ websites, cookies do things like:

  * remember your login details, settings or preferences
  * measure how you use a site so we can improve it based on your needs
  * personalise your online experience with us



We use cookies for different reasons. Some cookies are necessary for technical reasons, while other cookies support things like analytics or advertising and marketing activities. Pixel codes are similar to cookies and allow tracking of user actions. Regarding Facebook pixels you can manage your settings within your Facebook account.

#### Managing cookies and settings

You can delete and manage existing cookies on your device and manage your browser settings in relation to what new cookies can be installed on your device. For information about this you can visit websites such as [allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/), or the websites of browser producers such as Google (for Chrome browsers), Apple (for Safari browsers), Mozilla (for Firefox browsers) and Microsoft (for Internet Explorer and Edge browsers).

#### Cookies served through UQ websites

When you visit a UQ website, you will likely encounter first-party and third-party cookies. First-party cookies are set by the website owner (e.g. UQ), while third-party cookies are set by other websites (for example, Google or Facebook). Data collected using cookies from third parties can be shared with both the operator of the website you are on and with the third party cookie provider.

You can identify a UQ website by checking to see if the URL address has ‘uq.edu.au’ in it.

##### First-party cookies

On most UQ websites first-party cookies are used to:

  * remember your login details, settings or preferences
  * identify basic technical information about your browser and device
  * identify your location (e.g. international or domestic)



On some UQ websites, additional first-party cookies are used to support our marketing and advertising activities. These cookies collect additional data, including:

  * your device’s IP address and company name (inferred from your IP address or DNS)
  * demographic information depending on information you provide or that is available or that can be inferred e.g. age bracket, gender, interests and language
  * pages you viewed during your most recent visit
  * date and time of your web visits and how long you spend on-site
  * most recent search engine you used and your most recent search query
  * how you found the UQ page (for example, from a search engine, a link in an email, or a social media post)
  * actions you complete on the site (for example whether you do a search, submit a form, click on links or download an app)
  * in-app activity (if you download an app).



In some cases we may also use first-party cookies for data-matching purposes. For example, if you submit your contact details through an online form (for example, by signing up for an email newsletter) we may match information you include in the form (for example, your name and email address) to previously unidentified aggregated data in your cookies. This allows us to build a contact profile so we can send you personalised marketing information. You can manage this by using browser settings, choosing which forms or consents you provide and using any opt out functionality provided in email communications.

##### Third-party cookies

As noted above, third-party cookies are set by third party websites, not by UQ but can be used by UQ and those third party websites. Many UQ websites have third-party cookies, which support things like:

  * analytics and measurement;
  * online learning or lectures;
  * advertising and marketing; and
  * video, social media, maps and other third-party content.



Third-party cookies can collect the same kinds of information collected by first party cookies.

Some companies have introduced an optional “first-party mode” for their cookies. In simple terms, “first-party mode” allows a website owner to change a third-party cookie to a first-party cookie. In first-party mode it would not be blocked if you have set your browser to block third-party cookies. You can manage your browser settings to block first-party cookies and allow certain cookies on a case by case basis.

In some cases UQ uses “first-party mode” for Facebook pixels. First-party mode is only activated if you come from a Facebook website. It is not activated if you come from some other third party website. As noted above, you can manage your Facebook settings within your Facebook account.

#### Contacting our privacy coordinator

For further information regarding cookies or privacy matters generally you can contact our Privacy Coordinator at any time. For further information and contact details please go to [www.uq.edu.au/rti/](http://www.uq.edu.au/rti/).
