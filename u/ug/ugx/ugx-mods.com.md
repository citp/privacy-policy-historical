We collect anonymous data from every visitor of our products and services to monitor traffic and fix bugs.

For example, we collect information like web requests, the data sent in response to such requests, the Internet Protocol address, the browser type, the browser language, and a timestamp for the request.

We ask you to log in and provide certain personal information (such as your username and email address) in order to be able to save your profile and the documents and comments associated with it.

In order to enable these or any other login based features, we use cookies to store session information for your convenience.

You can block or delete cookies and still be able to use our products and services, although if you do you will then be asked for your username and password every time you log in to our products and services.

In order to take advantage of certain features of our products and services, you may also choose to provide us with other personal information, such as your picture or personal website, but your decision to utilize these features and provide such data will always be voluntary.

You are able to view, change and remove your data associated with your profile. Should you choose to delete your account, please contact us at [general@ugx-mods.com](mailto:general@ugx-mods.com) and we will follow up with such request as soon as possible.
