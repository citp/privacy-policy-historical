# Privacy Policy - uGiftIdeas.com

* * *

Effective September 1, 2014, we'll be implementing some updates to our Privacy Policy. To learn about how we treat information collected prior to September 1, 2014, please [click here](https://web.archive.org/privacy-2014-09-01.php). 

Effective Date: September 1, 2014.

Way Ventures, LLC. dba uGiftIdeas.com ("uGiftIdeas.com", "uGiftIdeas", "company", "We", "Us" or "Our") know that our users ("you," "your", "visitors", "user") care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. 

Please read this privacy policy ("Policy") carefully to understand how we will use and protect your personal information. We will not share your personal information with anyone except as described in this Policy. By visiting or using the uGiftIdeas.com website and domain name, and any other linked pages, features, content, or any other services we offer from time to time (collectively, the "Website"), you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information as described in this Policy. Changes to this Policy will be announced on uGiftIdeas at least ten (10) days in advance, so please check back periodically. 

Information Collection

The information we gather from you enables us to personalize and improve our services. Our goal is to provide you an efficient and customized experience when using our Website. 

We collect both "Personally Indentifiable Information" and "Non Personally Identifiable Information" (collectively, the "Personal Information") about you. "Personally Identifiable Information" refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are and can be used to identify, contact or locate you. "Non Personally Identifiable Information" refers to information that does not identify a specific individual by itself or in combination with other information.

We collect information from you in a variety of ways, including through user registration, surveys, sweepstakes, reminder services, and other instances where you are invited to volunteer such information.

We also collect information about how you interact with our website. This information is obtained through analysis of server logs and through the use of "cookies" placed on your machines. A cookie is a piece of software that a Web server can store on a PC to identify the User should they visit the website again. While not all of the information that we collect from Users is personally identifiable, it may be associated with personally identifiable information that Users provide us through our website. In addition, uGiftIdeas.com may collect information that includes website's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the Internet. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the Internet.

In addition, any personal information, saved gift ideas or gift lists, pictures or image content that you voluntarily disclose online will become publicly available and can be collected and used by others. 

Information Usage

We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone. We share your Personal Information only as described below.

Advertisers: We may share your Personally Identifiable Information and Non Personally Identifiable Information with our trusted affiliates, advertisers and/or merchant partners ("Advertisers") to display targeted advertisements and/or promotional offers and you agree that we may provide any of the information we have collected from you to an Advertiser. We may deliver a file to you through the Website (known as a "web beacon") from an ad network. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network's servers, these companies can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.

Business Transfers: If we are acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, Personal Information would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party. 

Public sharing of your data: We allow the public and other members of the site to browse your saved gift ideas, saved gift lists, comments, questions, answers, and profile information including your username, full name, and picture. Any content (including without limitation images and comments) you voluntarily disclose for other users to view on the Website will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others, and may be redistributed through the internet and other media channels. Additionally, if you sign into the Website through a third party social networking site or service, your list of "friends" from that site or service may be automatically imported to the Website, and such "friends," if they are also registered users of the Website, may be able to access certain non-public information you have entered in your Website user profile. We do not control the policies and practices of any other third party site or service.

Protection of uGiftIdeas and others: We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we reasonably believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of uGiftIdeas, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

Email communication: We may use your email to send information about related news, products, offers, surveys or promotions from uGiftIdeas or our Advertisers. You may also receive notification e-mails from uGiftIdeas, which inform you of actions (e.g. invites from friends) that have been performed on the site.

Information Disclosure

We do not sell or rent any of your personally identifying data to third parties. Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.

Third-party advertisers

We allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements on uGiftIdeas.com. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on uGiftIdeas. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.

Storage and Processing

Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. If you access your account via a third-party site or service, you may have additional or different sign-in protections via that third-party site or service. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-in mechanism appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account. We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time. In the event that we believe that the security of your Personal Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we will endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, we may do so by email. The Website may contain links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites. When linking to another site you should read that site's privacy policy.

Children Under 13 Years of Age

You must be 13 years and older to register to use the uGiftIdeas website. As a result, uGiftIdeas does not specifically collect information about children. If we learn that we have collected information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. We recommend that minors between the ages of 13 and 18 ask and receive their parents' permission before using uGiftIdeas or sending information about themselves or anyone else over the Internet.

Email Opt-Out

If you do not want to receive e-mails from uGiftIdeas.com, please unsubscribe by clicking the opt-out link at the bottom of any of our e-mails. Alternatively, you can send an email to support@ugiftideas.com with the word 'Unsubscribe' in the email subject. We will process your unsubscribe request as soon as possible. There may be promotional email campaigns in process and you may continue to receive emails from us for a few days. We require up to ten days to process your unsubscribe request. After this time, you will no longer receive marketing emails from uGiftIdeas.com. You may still receive emails regarding your transactions; for example, when you request to reset a lost or forgotten password.

Changes to this Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to change this privacy policy, and/or any part thereof, at any time, so please review it periodically. We may provide you additional forms of notice of modifications or updates as appropriate under the circumstances. Your continued use of uGiftIdeas.com or the Website after any modification to this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such modification.
