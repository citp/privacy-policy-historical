                     <h5><strong>1. Overview</strong></h5>
                     <p>The University of Georgia is committed to the responsible use of personal information
                        and sensitive information collected from and about its students, faculty, staff, business
                        partners and others who provide such information to the university. This commitment
                        is in accordance with both state and federal regulations concerning the use of sensitive
                        information. Such sensitive information includes information that could be used to
                        cause financial harm or reputational harm to any individual. This policy applies to
                        personally identifiable sensitive information and how it is collected.
                     </p>
                     <p><strong>2. Objective / Purpose</strong></p>
                     <p>The purpose of this policy is to protect the privacy of individuals who have sensitive
                        information stored (either in electronic or paper form) on assets owned by The University
                        of Georgia, while at the same time providing the University the ability to share this
                        information with authorized entities as required by legitimate academic or business
                        need <span>&nbsp;</span>or by law.
                     </p>
                     <p><strong>3. Scope</strong></p>
                     <p>The UGA Privacy Policy applies to all faculty, staff, students, affiliates, and third-party
                        service providers. This policy is not intended to replace or supersede other existing
                        University policies and procedures relating to the use of maintenance of sensitive
                        information such as those related to FERPA compliance, GLBA compliance, or human subjects
                        research.
                     </p>
                     <p><strong>4. Privacy Policy</strong></p>
                     <p><em><i>4.1 Limits on Use of and Access to Sensitive Information</i></em></p>
                     <p>The responsible use of sensitive information requires that the University respect
                        individual privacy, protect against unauthorized access to or use of information,
                        and comply fully with all laws and government regulations in the collection, use,
                        storage, display, distribution and disposal of such information. Authorized uses of
                        sensitive information within the University are limited to uses which a) are necessary
                        to meet legal and regulatory requirements; b) facilitate access to services, transactions,
                        facilities and information; or c) support efficient academic and administrative processes.
                     </p>
                     <p>Access to sensitive information is limited to:</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>the individual whose information is produced or displayed;</li>
                        <li>a University official or agent of the University with authorized access based upon
                           a legitimate academic or business interest and a need to know;
                        </li>
                        <li>an organization or person authorized by the individual to receive the information;</li>
                        <li>a legally authorized government entity or representative;</li>
                        <li>other circumstances in which the University is legally compelled to provide access
                           to information, such as the Georgia Open Records Act;
                        </li>
                        <li>or other individuals or entities, as allowed by law, for purposes judged to be appropriate
                           or necessary for the reasonable conduct of University business.
                        </li>
                     </ul>
                     <p><em><i>4.2&nbsp;Social Security Numbers</i></em></p>
                     <p>Social Security numbers are always considered confidential and are therefore subject
                        to the limits of use and access described above. In addition, the University will
                        continue to collect and process Social Security Numbers limited only to instances
                        in which that number is required by law or contract or instances where there is a
                        legitimate business or academic need authorized by University administration. This
                        includes, but is not limited to, all enrolled students who are U.S. citizens or permanent
                        residents.
                     </p>
                     <p>The University, its faculty, staff, and students must abide by all state legal regulations
                        pertaining to&nbsp;<a href="/access_and_security/infosec/pols_regs/ssn_protection/">Social Security Number protection</a>.
                     </p>
                     <p>It is against both state law and University policy to:</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Publicly post or display the Social Security number in any manner;</li>
                        <li>Require an individual to transmit his or her Social Security number over the Internet
                           unless the connection is secure or the number is encrypted; or
                        </li>
                        <li>Require an individual to use his or her Social Security number to access an Internet
                           site unless a unique password or PIN is also required.
                        </li>
                        <li>Print the Social Security number on any card required to access services; or</li>
                        <li>Establish a new process that requires the printing of a Social Security number on
                           any materials that are mailed unless required by other state or federal agency.
                        </li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>4.3&nbsp;<em><i>Online Collection of Information</i></em></p>
                     <p>University departments must post a link to the UGA Privacy Policy on any website which
                        collects data about website visitors.

                     <p><span face="Merriweather Sans" style="font-family: 'Merriweather Sans';"><i>5.1 Lawful Basis for Collecting and Processing of Personal Data&nbsp;</i></span></p>
                     <p><span>The University is an institute of higher education involved in education, research,
                           and community development.<span>&nbsp; </span>In order for the University to educate its students both in class and on-line, engage
                           in world-class research, and provide community services, it is essential, necessary,
                           and the University has lawful bases to collect, process, use, and maintain data of
                           its students, employees, applicants, research subjects, and others involved in its
                           educational, research, and community programs. The lawful bases include, without limitation,
                           admission, registration, delivery of classroom, on-line, and study abroad education,
                           grades, communications, employment, research, development, program analysis for improvements,
                           and records retention. Examples of data that the University may need to collect in
                           connection with the lawful bases are: name, email address, IP address, physical address
                           or other location identifier, photos, as well as some sensitive personal data obtained
                           with prior consent.</span></p>
                     <p><span>For more information regarding the EU GDPR, please review the University’s European
                           Union General Data Protection Regulation Compliance Policy.</span></p>
                     <p>Most of the University’s collection and processing of personal data will fall under
                        the following categories:
                     </p>
                     <p>a) Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by
                        the University or third parties in providing education, employment, research and development,
                        community programs.<br>b) Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject
                        is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering
                        into a contract. This lawful basis pertains primarily but not exclusively to research
                        contracts.<br>c) Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the University
                        is subject. This lawful basis pertains primarily but not exclusively to compliance
                        with state and federal laws. Examples are providing enrollment data to the US Department
                        of Education and providing employment and payroll data as required by the US Internal
                        Revenue Service.<br>d) The data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data
                        for one or more specific purposes.<span></span>This lawful basis pertains primarily but not exclusively to the protection of research
                        subjects, providing medical and mental health services.
                     </p>
                     <p>There will be some instances where the collection and processing of personal data
                        will be pursuant to other lawful bases.
                     </p>
                     <p><em><span><i>5.2 Types of Personal Data collected and why</i></span></em></p>
                     <p><span>The University collects a variety of personal and sensitive data to meet one of its
                           lawful bases, as referenced above. Most often the data is used for academic admissions,
                           enrollment, educational programs, job hiring, provision of medical services, participation
                           in research, development and community outreach. Data typically includes name, address,
                           transcripts, work history, information for payroll, research subject information,
                           medical and health information (for student health services, or travel), and donations.
                           If you have specific questions regarding the collection and use of your personal data,
                           please contact </span>the Office of Information Security at infosec@uga.edu<span>.</span></p>
                     <p><span>If a data subject refuses to provide personal data that is required by the University
                           in connection with one of the University’s lawful bases to collect such personal data,
                           such refusal may make it impossible for the University to provide education, employment,
                           research or other requested services.</span></p>
                     <p><strong><span>Where the University gets Personal and Sensitive Personal Data</span></strong></p>
                     <p><span>The University receives personal and sensitive data from multiple sources. Most often,
                           the University gets this data directly from the data subject or under the direction
                           of the data subject who has provided it to a third party (for example, application
                           for admission to the University through use of the Common App). </span></p>

                        legitimate interest for the processing (if applicable);<br>d) who the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data are;<br>e) whether the University intends to transfer personal data to another country or
                        international organization;<br>f) the period for which the personal data will be stored;<br>g) the existence of the right to access, make corrections to, or erase personal data,
                        the right to restrict or object to processing, and the right to data portability;<br>h) the existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time (if applicable);<br>i) the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (established in the
                        EU);<br>j) justification for why the personal data are required, and possible consequences
                        of the failure to provide the personal data;<br>k) the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling; and<br>l) if the collected personal data are going to be further processed for a purpose
                        other than that for which it was collected.

                        rights (as applicable), provided that the University determines that the exercise
                        of the right is permitted and/or required by the EU GDPR:
                     </p>
