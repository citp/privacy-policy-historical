It is against both state law and University policy to:

  * Publicly post or display the Social Security number in any manner;
  * Require an individual to transmit his or her Social Security number over the Internet unless the connection is secure or the number is encrypted; or 
  * Require an individual to use his or her Social Security number to access an Internet site unless a unique password or PIN is also required. 



This Privacy Policy also prohibits the following:

  * Printing the Social Security number on any card required to access services; or
  * Establishing a new process that requires the printing of a Social Security number on any materials that are mailed unless required by other state or federal agency.
