Opting out in this manner will not end transmission of service-related emails, such as email alerts. You may not opt-out of all of these communications, which are not promotional in nature, but many such alerts can be turned off in your account settings page. If you do not wish to receive them and you cannot turn them off in your account settings page, you have the option to deactivate your account.

These forums use third party services such as Salesforce (d/b/a Desk.com), Facebook, Twitter and others. If you interact with these forums, you should be aware that any information you submit there can be read, collected or used by other users and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these forums. These forums are operated by third parties, which maintain their own privacy policies.

Services like Facebook Connect may give you the option to post information about your activities on this Web site.

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

### Your Consent.

We may share or disclose your information with your consent, such as when you use a third party web client to access your Upserve account.

Other than as described in this Privacy and Security Policy, we will not disclose your Registration Information, Account Credentials, or Account Data to any third parties.

We may share your personal information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to obligations mirroring the protections of this privacy policy.

We may disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect Upserve’s rights or property.

### Business Transfers.

If the ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner so that the service can continue to operate. In such a case, your information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.

### Non-Private or Non-Personal Information.

Upserve may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated, anonymous or otherwise non-personal information and disclose such data only in a non-personally identifiable manner. We may share information that is not personally identifiable to you or your business, including aggregated statistical information derived from Program Data, with our affiliates, partners, merchants, and others.

## Modifying Your Personal Information

### Editing your profile.

If you are a registered user of our Service, we provide you with tools to access or modify the personal information you provided to us and associated with your account. You may change your profile information at any time by going to your settings page.

### Deleting your account.

You can delete your account by issuing a request via email to support@upserve.com or by following the “Delete Account” link on the settings page, if available. When you request us to delete your account for the Service, your loyalty program data will be expunged from our primary production servers and further access to your account will not be possible. However, portions of your data, consisting of aggregate, anonymized data derived from your Account Information, may remain on our production servers indefinitely. Your data may also remain on a backup server or media. Upserve keeps these backups to ensure our continued ability to provide the Service to you in the event of malfunction or damage to our primary production servers. We also reserve the right to use any aggregated or anonymous data derived from or incorporating your personal information.

### Limitations on Removal.

Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account, copies of that information may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent it has been shared with others, it was otherwise distributed pursuant to your privacy settings, or it was copied or stored by other users. Additionally, we may retain certain information to prevent identity theft and other misconduct even if deletion has been requested.

### Backup copies.

Removed and deleted information may persist in backup copies, but will not be available to others.

## Data Security – Your Information Is Secure

### Access controls.

We use a combination of firewall barriers, encryption techniques and authentication procedures, among others, to maintain the security of your online session and to protect Upserve accounts and systems from unauthorized access.

### Access password.

When you register for the Service, Upserve requires a password from you for your privacy and security. Upserve transmits information such as your Registration Information for Upserve securely. We maintain strict rules to help prevent others from guessing your password. We also recommend that you change your password periodically. Your password must be at least 6 characters in length. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Login ID and Password. You may not provide these credentials to any third party. If you believe that they have been stolen or been made known to others, you must contact us immediately at security@upserve.com, but in any event you should change your password immediately via the Service. We are not responsible if someone else accesses your account through Registration Information they have obtained from you or through a violation by you of this Privacy and Security Policy or Upserve’s Terms of Use.

### Encrypted communications.

All communications of your password or other sensitive data communications between your computer and Upserve are encrypted. This enables client and server applications to communicate in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering and message forgery. To encrypt these communications, Upserve employs an SSL-EV certificate, the highest grade of communications encryption available. You can verify your Account Credentials are being sent securely by looking for the ‘green bar’ that indicates an SSL-EV connection in your Web browser.

### Secure physical facilities.

Our servers are in a secure facility. Access requires multiple levels of authentication, including biometrics recognition procedures. Security personnel monitor the system 7 days a week, 24 hours a day.

### Database encryption.

Our databases are protected from general employee access both physically and logically. We encrypt your Service password so that your password cannot be recovered, even by us. All backups also are encrypted.

### Building access controls.

We enforce physical access controls to our buildings.
