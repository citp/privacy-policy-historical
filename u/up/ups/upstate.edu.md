SUNY Upstate Medical University (Upstate) is committed to protecting your privacy and making it easier and more efficient for individuals and businesses to interact with Upstate. Upstate recognizes that individuals and businesses need to be confident that their privacy is protected when visiting Upstate's Web sites. Most Web sites can be visited without providing any information about your visit, however sometimes Upstate needs information to provide services requested. This policy explains Upstate's practices.

Consistent with the provisions of New York State's Internet Privacy and Security Act, the Freedom of Information Law, and the Personal Privacy Protection Law, this policy describes Upstate's privacy practices regarding information collected from __user_ s_ of this Web site and how the information is used. Because this privacy policy only applies to Upstate's Web sites, __user_ s_ should examine the privacy policy of any Web site, including other linked Web sites and _state agency Web sites_ , that may be accessed using Upstate's Web sites.

**SUNY Upstate Medical University does not collect any _personal information_ about a visit unless that information is provided voluntarily by sending an e-mail, responding to a survey, or completing an on-line transaction.**
