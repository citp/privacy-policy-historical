**Information we collect and how it is used ...**

For each visitor to our Web page, our Web server automatically recognizes only the consumer's domain name, but not the e-mail address.

We collect only the domain name, but not the e-mail address of visitors to our web page. We collect, but do not share, the e-mail addresses of those who post messages to our bulletin board, those who make postings to our chat areas, aggregate information on what pages consumers access or information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information and/or site registrations.

The information we collect is used only to improve the content of our Web page, our programs, and our resources. The information is not sold, traded, or shared with any individuals or organizations for any purpose. (The only exception to this policy would be the specified release of information in response to a valid court order.)

With respect to cookies: We use cookies to store visitors preferences; record session information, such as items that consumers add to their shopping cart; record user-specific information on what pages users access or visit; or record past activity at a site in order to provide better service when visitors return to our site.

We do not send unsolicited e-mail. However, we do send e-mail newsletters to various Upper Room® e-mail listserves by request of the user. These lists are described on the following web page: <http://www.upperroom.org/subpages/mailinglists.asp> If you do not want to receive e-mail from us, you can unsubscribe your e-mail address by visiting the [unsubscribe page](http://www.upperroom.org/unsubscribe/) (instructions are appended at the bottom of each e-mail we send out). 

We publish an E-Mail Edition of The Upper Room® daily devotional magazine: <http://www.upperroom.org/devotional/email/>. Information collected in the process of subscribing to the E-Mail Devotional or any other Upper Room lists is not shared with any other organizations or individuals. 

If you supply us with your postal address on-line in a bookstore or print magazine order, you may receive mailings of interest to you from us or other selected, reputable companies. You can, however, put your name on our do-not-share list by sending e-mail to us at [marketing@bbs.upperroom.org](mailto:marketing@bbs.upperroom.org) or calling or writing to us at the above address or phone number. Please provide us with your exact name and address. We will be sure your name is removed from the list we share with other organizations.

Individuals and churches who supply us with their telephone numbers on-line may receive telephone contact from us with information regarding orders they have placed on-line. Please provide us with your correct phone number. We never sell, trade, or share these phone numbers with other individuals or organizations. Individuals will not receive any calls from us unrelated to the fulfillment of orders. However, from time to time we make phone contact with our church customers in order to improve our services to them. 

**Policies for Children (Under the Age of 13)**

The Upper Room encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in the activities offered on the Upper Room web site. No personally identifiable information should be submitted to or posted at The Upper Room by visitors under 13 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian. 

This web site does not solicit or allow children under 13 to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information. In the event that we ask for information online from children under the age of 13, we do not require personally identifiable information such as child's last name, city, or e-mail address. 

If our Upper Room staff receive e-mail from children under 13, we may contact the child under the following circumstances:  


  * **a)** to respond directly to the child's request on a one-time basis to a specific request from the child where it is not used to re-contact the child for other purposes, 
  * **b)** in order to request the name or online contact information of a parent for the sole purpose of obtaining verifiable parental consent or providing parental notification, and 
  * **c)** to respond more than once directly to a specific request from the child and not used to re-contact the child beyond the scope of that request (such as the case where a child requests a newsletter subscription). Where the information is used to contact the child more than once, The Upper Room uses reasonable efforts to provide parental notification. 



**Summary**

We are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect about you to process orders, to improve our web page and resource content, and to evaluate our ministry with you. If you should have questions about our privacy policy or want to have your name and address added to our do-not-share list, please call, write, or send us an e-mail with your exact name and address.
