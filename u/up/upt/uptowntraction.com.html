<br><br>
3. INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT<br>
Uptown Traction collects certain information from and about its users three ways:<br>1. Directly from our Web Server logs. <br>2. From the user. <br>3. Through the use of cookies.

 •The kind of browser or computer you use.<br>

 b. Use of Cookies<br>
Uptown Traction may use cookies to personalize or enhance your user experience. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web Server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. Hence, this simplifies the process of delivering relevant content and eases site navigation by providing and saving your preferences and login information as well as providing personalized functionality. 

<br><br>Uptown Traction reserves the right to share aggregated site statistics with partner companies, but does not allow other companies to place cookies on our website unless there is a temporary, overriding customer value (such as merging into UptownTraction.com a site that relies on third-party cookies).
 
<br><br>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If you reject cookies by changing your browser settings then be aware that this may disable some of the functionality on our Website.

If you are purchasing a service, we will request financial information. Any financial information we collect is used only to bill you for the services you purchased. If you purchase by credit card, this information may be forwarded to your credit card provider. For other types of registrations, we will ask for the relevant information. You may also be asked to disclose personal information to us so that we can provide assistance and information to you. For example, such data may be warranted in order to provide online technical support and troubleshooting.

 1.To fulfill your service requests for services.<br>

4. USE OF WEB BEACONS OR GIF FILES
 Uptown Traction's web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons – sometimes also called single-pixel gifs – that allow UptownTraction.com to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. UptownTraction may include Web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.Some of these Web beacons may be placed by third party service providers to help determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns or e-mail communications. These Web beacons may be used by these service providers to place a persistent cookie on your computer. This allows the service provider to recognize your computer each time you visit certain pages or e-mail s and compile anonymous information in relation to those page views, which in turn enables us and our service providers to learn which advertisements and e-mail s bring you to our website and how you use the site. Uptown Traction prohibits Web beacons from being used to collect or access your personal information.
