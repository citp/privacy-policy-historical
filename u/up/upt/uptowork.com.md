We use tracking technologies (including [cookies, flash cookies, unique device identifiers, web beacons/GIFs, embedded scripts, e-tags/cache browsers, cross-device tracking](https://zety.com/cookies-and-tracking)) to collect usage information. We can use tracking technologies for a variety of purposes, including:

Operationally-Necessary. We can use tracking technologies required for system administration, to prevent fraudulent activity, improve security or allow you to make use of shopping cart functionality. We are not required to obtain your consent to tracking technologies that are operationally necessary.

Performance-Related. We can use cookies or other tracking technologies to assess the performance of the online services, including as part of our analytic practices to improve the content offered through the online services. For example, as set forth in detail in our [Cookies and Trackings Technology Policy](https://zety.com/cookies-and-tracking), we use [Google Analytics](https://zety.com/cookies-and-tracking) and [Inspectlet](https://www.inspectlet.com/) to perform site analytics.

Functionality-Related. We can use tracking technologies to tell us, for example, whether you have visited the Site before or if you are a new visitor and to help us identify the features in which you have the greatest interest.

Targeting-Related. We can use tracking technologies to deliver content, including ads, relevant to your interests on our online service and third-party sites based on how you interact with our advertisements or content as well as track the content you access (including video viewing). Further information on this, and your [opt-out choices](https://zety.com/cookies-and-tracking), is below.

We can also collect password information from you when you log in, as well as computer and/or connection information. During some visits we can use software tools to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, time spent on certain pages and page interaction information.

To learn more about how we use tracking technologies and cookies, see Section 7 of this Privacy Policy.

g) Apply Tool Privacy Notice and Information We Collect. We can automatically collect certain information (including Personal Information) from your device or web browser. We can automatically collect information from location storage associated with your web browser, including your browsing behavior for career searching activity. We can also automatically record your interactions with certain webpages by accessing local storage associated with your web browser. The Apply Tool was made to automatically interact with third party websites, so we can also collect some non-personal data about you when you visit those websites including, clickstream data, operating system being used, the URL of the site you have come from and move to after your visit, data relating to your activities on third party websites (including IP addresses and URLs) via tracking technologies (such as cookies and measurement software), the date and time of your visit and your server's IP address, the geo-location of your device, and the type of payment you use. We collect this information for statistical purposes to find out how our website and the Apply Tool are being used. We can use this information to evaluate and, hopefully, improve your experience. As an example, when you visit a webpage that supports the autofill function, we can record metadata generated by your web browser that identifies one or more autofill fields that you interact with. In this example, we can also access local storage associated with your web browser to determine information (including Personal Information) which can be or has been entered into an autofill field. We use your information to facilitate your completion of job applications across the internet, on our websites and third-party websites and to provide advertising and/or other content that we believe can be of interest to you based upon your browsing behavior on the internet.

9\. Notice to California Residents

a) California Civil Code Section 1798.83, known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits our customers who are California residents to request and obtain from us a list of what Personal Information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year and the names and addresses of those third parties. Requests can be made only once a year and are free of charge. To make such a request, please contact us at [californiarequest@bold.com](mailto:californiarequest@bold.com). For all requests, you must put the statement "Your California Privacy Rights" in the body of your request, as well as your name, street address, city, state, and zip code.

You need to attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for our response. Please note that we will not accept requests via the telephone, mail, or by facsimile, and we are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or that do not have complete information.

b) California Business & Professions Code Section 22575 (b) provides that California residents are entitled to know how Provider responds to "Do Not Track" browser settings. Provider does not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been adopted. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is universally accepted.

10\. Notice to Residents of the European Union

Provider complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR"). As such, Provider affords to all European data subjects their respective data privacy rights to the extent they are applicable including: (i) right to rectify inaccurate data; (ii) right to erasure (deletion of your Personal Information); (iii) right to restrict processing of your Personal Information; (iv) right of data portability; and (v) right to object.

In certain situations, and subject to applicable law, Provider will not be able or obliged to comply with part or all of your individual requests. Please note that we have the right to refuse and/or charge a monetary fee for requests which are manifestly unfounded or excessive, for example due to their repetitive character. If you have unresolved concerns, you have the right to complain to an EU Supervisory Authority.

Providing your information to us is optional, but it can impact our ability to offer the Service to you. For example, if you do not provide your complete Personal Information, we will not always be able to respond to your request in a timely manner.

11\. Third Parties

Our Site can contain links to other third-party websites and Provider can provide products and services that share information with third party sites for your job search.

12\. Information Security

We maintain technical, physical, and administrative security measures designed to protect the security of your Personal Information against loss, misuse, unauthorized or accidental access, disclosure, copying, use or alteration.

When you create an account/profile or otherwise provide us with Personal Information, you consent to the collection, storage and/or processing of your Personal Information in the United States, Canada and other countries of your Personal Information and tracking technologies/cookies as described in this Privacy Policy. We take appropriate measures to ensure adequate protection of the privacy rights of EEA data subjects with respect to Personal Information that we transfer outside the EEA to a country that is not subject to an adequacy decision by the EU Commission.
