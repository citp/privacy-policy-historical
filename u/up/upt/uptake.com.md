# Privacy Policy

This statement is a part of the UpTake user agreement but trumps any conflicts with the agreement.  This statement only addresses our practices associated with the UpTake.com website. Other websites we operate may be subject to other practices. You have rights under California Civil Code 1798.83 to learn more about our disclosure of your personal data; to exercise those rights, contact [privacy@uptake.com](mailto:privacy@uptake.com).  The effective date of this statement is September 2 2010.

**Data You Provide Us.**

_Account Data_. You provide us with some personal data to create your account (or, we might get that data from a third party co-brand partner or other vendor). You can also tell us more about yourself via your account pages or elsewhere. We may give you choices about whether to publish specific items of account data to everyone, your friends, or just yourself.  In addition to displaying account data in connection with your accounts public profile and your public activity on the site, we use account data for many purposes, which may include to improve the site, generate reports of aggregated activity that we share with others, target ads to you and send emails to you. Typically, you can turn our emails on and off, but our administrative emails are mandatory so long as you have an account.

If you register through a co-branded site, we might share your account data with the cobrand partner, in which case your data is governed by that entitys privacy policies, not ours.

_Content and Ratings_. Our site allows you to publish Content. The user agreement describes how we and our licensees may republish (or stop publishing) your Content. We may publish some or all account data with your Content (but if we have asked for your preferences, we will honor them). We may publish your product/review/other ratings, license the ratings to others, and use the ratings to develop aggregate ratings, personalize site views, merchandise products and identify/feature popular members or reviews.

_Interest in Third Party Offerings_. You may have opportunities to express interest in, or register for, third parties offerings. If you do, we will follow your instructions about providing your data to the third party (and we may retain the data as well).

_Surveys_.  Unless otherwise specified at a surveys beginning, we treat your survey responses like we treat our other business records.

_Accessing Your Records_. The information described in California Business & Professions Code Sec. 1798.83 is available by submitting the statutorily required information to [privacy@uptake.com](mailto:privacy@uptake.com).

**Data We Collect Automatically.** As part of our servers normal operations, we log your IP address and referring/destination URLs. We may use this data and other server usage data to analyze site and user behavior, improve the site, troubleshoot technical problems, resolve disputes, address complaints and generate reports of aggregated activity that we share with others.

We and our third party vendors (such as our web analytics service provider) may use cookies and web beacons to analyze site usage, improve the site, target ads, store your preferences/passwords (if youve registered), personalize your experience (including tracking your site usage to do so) and generate reports of aggregated activity that we share with others.  You must accept cookies to access UpTake.com as a registered user.

**Other Data Collection.** We may get data from or about you in other ways not specifically described in this statement.  For example, you might contact Customer Service, or we may get a third party complaint about you.  We handle this data like other business records.

**Data Changes.** To the extent we permit you to modify or delete your data or Content, we usually update our live databases immediately, but some data may update more slowly, and some old data may remain indefinitely in our archives and records.  Also, we may be unable to propagate changes to partners who receive your data or Content.

**Contractors/Service Providers.** Third party contractors may have access to our databases. Usually these contractors sign a standard confidentiality agreement.

Some of our sites functionality may be operated by third party service providers, and in the course of providing this functionality, these service providers may obtain some of your personal data from you directly or transferred from us to facilitate your usage of this service.  Usually we require these providers to use and disclose your personal data only as necessary to perform their services.

Third party ad servers may place or recognize a cookie and, using the cookie or otherwise, collect and use data from your visits to this and other websites to serve ads to you.

**Our Corporate Family.** We may share your data with any parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, other entities under a common control or third party acquirers. We expect these other entities will honor this statement.  Also, we may allow a potential acquirer or merger partner to review our databases, although we would restrict their use and disclosure of this data during the diligence phase.

**Government Relations and Lawsuits.** We may disclose data about you to the government if we are required to do so or if we think the disclosure is appropriate; and you authorize these disclosures. We may also disclose data about you in connection with actual or potential legal proceedings (a) if we are required to do so, (b) if such disclosures might mitigate our liability, or (c) to enforce our rights.

**Communicating with Other Users.** You may not collect (manually or in an automated manner) other users personal data (including email addresses) from the site.

**Children.** If you are 12 and under, do not use the site or provide any data to us.

**Limits on Our Abilities.** Our site is very complicated, so we might inadvertently use or disclose

your data in ways inconsistent with this statement.  For example, a temporary software glitch could lead to public display of your personal data despite your contrary preferences.  We might also make ad hoc uses of your data in ways not mentioned here.  In these anomalous situations, your sole remedy is that we will try to rectify the anomaly as soon as we can.

**Security.** We use industry-standard security protocols, such as (if and where we think appropriate) firewalls and restrictions on which employees can access user data.  However, perfect security does not exist on the Internet.

**Amendment.** This privacy statement is part of the UpTake user agreement and can be modified in accordance with the amendment procedures described in that document.

We welcome suggestions on how to improve our service for you. Please [email us](mailto:feedback@uptake.com) your feedback - the good, the ugly, the things we should add and what needs to be fixed! We appreciate your input.
