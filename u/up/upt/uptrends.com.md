## Use of Personal Data

The following is an overview of our purposes for using personal data that we process as a data controller. Additional details on how we process your personal data may be provided to you in a separate notice or contract.

For individuals in the European Union, we justify our processing (i.e. use) of your personal data on the following legal bases:

  * **Performance of contract:**  the processing is necessary to perform a contract with you or take steps to enter into a contract at your request;
  * **Compliance with law:**  the processing is necessary for us to comply with a relevant legal obligation (for example, laws which require us to collect tax information from customers, carry out checks on customers, or which compel us to disclose information to public authorities or regulators);
  * **Our legitimate interests:**  the processing is in our legitimate interests, subject to your interests and fundamental rights, and notably our legitimate interest in using applicable data to conduct and develop our business activities, such as developing and maintaining relationships with our customers (the majority of the processing covered by this notice is legitimate interest based); *
  * **Defend our rights:**  where the processing is necessary to the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims; or
  * **With your consent:**  you have consented to the processing (for example, where local law requires us to rely upon your prior consent for the purposes of direct marketing).



* In all cases where legitimate interests are relied upon as a lawful basis, we take steps to ensure that our legitimate interests are not outweighed by any prejudice to your rights and freedoms. This is achieved in a number of ways including through the application of principles of data minimization and security, by taking steps to ensure that personal data is only collected or otherwise obtained where it is relevant to the lawful business activities, and where using personal data is reasonably necessary for those activities.

## Disclosure of Personal Data

Uptrends is a global group of companies, and we may share personal data with our affiliated businesses as part of our business operations and administration of the Services. We may also appoint third-party service providers (who will operate under our instructions) to assist us in providing information, products, or services to you in conducting and managing our business or in managing and improving our Services or the Sites. Uptrends may share your personal data with these affiliates and third parties to perform services that Uptrends has engaged the third parties to perform on Uptrends' behalf subject to appropriate contractual restrictions and security measures, if we believe it is reasonably necessary to prevent harm or loss, or we believe that the disclosure will further an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activities.

Uptrends reserves the right to share any information that is not deemed personal data or is not otherwise subject to contractual restrictions.

If personal data is transferred outside the EU to other Uptrends group companies or third-party service providers, we will take steps to ensure that your personal data receives the same level of protection as if it remained within the EU. You have a right to obtain details of the mechanism under which your personal data is transferred outside of the EU by [contacting us](https://web.archive.org/contact).

Uptrends does not transfer personal data to a third party for the third party’s own use, but only for Uptrends’ purposes as outlined above. Uptrends will remain liable under the Principles if one of its third-party processors processes personal data in a manner inconsistent with the Principles if we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

## Other Disclosures

_Law enforcement or national security_. In accordance with our legal obligations, we may also transfer Customer Data, subject to a lawful request, to public authorities for law enforcement or national security purposes.
