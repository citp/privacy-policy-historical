      The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices

      The Uptilt site offers several opportunities for visitors to register for 
      free information, seminars or demonstration copies of our software, and 
      for assistance in evaluating our software and services. These registration 
      forms are often linked to Uptilt mailing lists and require users to give 
      contact information (such as name and e-mail address). We use this contact 
      information to send users information about our company and its products 
      and services. The information is also used to contact site visitors by e-mail 
      for marketing purposes if they have granted permission to us to send it 
      to them on the mailing list form (or other forms on our web site), and for 
      administrative purposes such as time and location of seminars. Users may 
      also be contacted by phone or postal mail for marketing purposes. Any financial 
      information collected is shared with our credit card processor to bill users 
      for Uptilt software, and is stored by our credit card processor and Uptilt 
      <br>

      We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to 
      administer our Web site. Your IP address is also used to gather broad, personally 
      non-identifiable demographic information, such as which countries our site 
      visitors come from. This web site does not currently use cookies, but it 
      may do so in the future. If so, cookies may be used to correlate previously 
      supplied information about you for personalization and tracking purposes.

      Uptilt Clients</i></b><br>
      <br>
      Uptilt provides online marketing services and products to its clients. These 
      services include customer database management and analysis, e-mail delivery, 
      e-mail tracking and web site tracking. For all clients, Uptilt is contractually 
      bound to keep customer data private and prevented from sharing data across 
      multiple clients. For example, if one of our client's customers has two 
      e-mail addresses, and these addresses are stored in our database, we may 
      not share this fact with another client, even if the second client has the 
      same customer has the first client. The example below illustrates this. 
      Client A and Client B both share the customer John Doe. Client A has two 
      email addresses for John Doe, but Client B does not because Client B has 
      not gathered that information.</font><br>
