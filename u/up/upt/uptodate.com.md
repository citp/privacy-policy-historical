## Subscriber Information

UpToDate never automatically collects any information that specifically identifies you such as your name, address, or e-mail address. This information is collected only when you voluntarily provide it as part of the subscription process ("Subscriber Information"). We will ask you whenever we need Subscriber Information that identifies you or allows us to contact you. 

## Consent and Security

It is your choice whether or not you provide your Subscriber Information to UpToDate, but Subscriber Information is required for UpToDate to provide you with services (for example, access to UpToDate under a subscription agreement). 

## Use of Subscriber Information

Your Subscriber Information may be used internally within UpToDate. For example, UpToDate may use your Subscriber Information internally to provide subscription services to you and process your transactions, to contact you for customer service and billing purposes, to communicate to you about your subscription or changes to our service, to understand who uses the Website and to improve the Website. In addition, UpToDate reserves the right to disclose your Subscriber Information under limited circumstances in the event UpToDate believes that the Website is being used to commit unlawful acts, and/or if disclosure of your Subscriber Information is required to comply with applicable laws or regulations, or with a court or administrative order. 

## Usage Information

Non-personally identifying information ("Usage Information") comprises information that does not identify any particular user. Examples include: information about which of UpToDate's pages are visited on an aggregate level, browser type, operating system type, or IP address. 

## Use of Usage Information

Your Usage Information may be disclosed internally within UpToDate and to third parties. For example, UpToDate may disclose Usage Information in order to better understand which parts of the Website users are visiting, to improve the content of the Website, and for marketing, advertising, or research purposes. (Institutional licensees should refer to their subscription and license agreement).
