Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web Server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. Hence, this simplifies the process of delivering relevant content and eases site navigation by providing and saving your preferences and login information as well as providing personalized functionality. 

Uptown Traction reserves the right to share aggregated site statistics with partner companies, but does not allow other companies to place cookies on our website unless there is a temporary, overriding customer value (such as merging into UptownTraction.com a site that relies on third-party cookies).

USE OF WEB BEACONS OR GIF FILES Uptown Traction's web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons – sometimes also called single-pixel gifs – that allow UptownTraction.com to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services.
