# UpMyStreet Small print: Privacy policy

### Privacy policy

##### Your privacy is important to us

UpMyStreet believes your right to privacy is important. To run an efficient, effective service, however, we need to collect and use certain information about our users. 

##### What information do we collect and why?

UpMyStreet may also gather anonymous information for its own use and/or to be shared with third parties. This is information that does not personally identify you, but which may be helpful for marketing purposes, for improving the services we offer, or for informing advertisers of the number of consumers that have clicked on their advertising banners. Generally, this information involves 'traffic' data, such as the number of first-time and return users to the website every month. 

##### How do we protect your personal details?

We have strict procedures governing the storage and disclosure of personal details to prevent unauthorised access and misuse. In addition, all your personal information is password-protected: only you, UpMyStreet and our partner websites have access to your personal information. 

##### E-mail this page to a friend

If you use this service, you can be sure that UpMyStreet will not collect the e-mail addresses that you provide for other purposes. We will only hold this information for as long as is necessary to transmit the e-mail to the recipient. 

##### Do you have any other questions about privacy?

We want you to feel happy about any information you give us and know that you have control over the way it is used. If you have any questions about our privacy policy, please e-mail them to us by clicking on 'Feedback' on the website.
