# HealthGate's Privacy Policy CHOICE For UPMC Health

### Security

The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our users is of utmost concern to us. The level of security is established by the member of the HealthGate Network. You can determine the security status of the site by looking at the url: urls that start with “https: “ are secure sites.

Personal information submitted by you when you are using WellMed’s Health Risk Assessment or Personal Health Manager is transmitted to WellMed via a secure method that uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption. At WellMed, the information is stored in a secure database behind an electronic firewall and is password-protected. Once you have registered for access to secure area hosted WellMed, you would have been assigned a username and password. You are the only person who has access to this information. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. HealthGate will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or e-mail. Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and any account information.

If you access HealthGate from a public workstation in a library or hospital, remember to sign out and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if your computer is accessible to others.

HealthGate cannot completely ensure the privacy of e-mail communications to and from our site because they are not encrypted and, therefore, not secure. These communications, like most Internet e-mail, could be intercepted without your knowledge and permission, while in transit to or from our site. This includes e-mail you send to us through our various mailboxes, and URL information e-mailed from our site to others using the "Send to a friend" feature. If you are concerned about your privacy, we suggest that you do not use e-mail to communicate information to us that you consider sensitive.

Once we have information that we may have obtained while you have visited a site on the HealthGate Network, we store this information on database servers at the HealthGate Data Center, that we house at a Cable & Wireless Internet Services Inc. secure facility in Waltham, Massachusetts. Cable & Wireless Internet Services Inc. maintains both onsite guards, pass code locked doors access, and pass code authority.

Although HealthGate will make every effort to safeguard your personal information, you should know that no site could warrant that it is 100% secure from “hackers” who might learn how to evade security systems or intercept transmissions over the Internet.
