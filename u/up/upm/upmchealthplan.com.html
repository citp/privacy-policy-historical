<h2>Privacy Statement &amp; HIPAA Forms</h2>

<p>That's right — your personal information is   private and confidential. We at UPMC Health Plan want to take this opportunity   to remind you that this is the trust that we establish with you. It is a pledge   that we take seriously. Whether you are a prospective, current or former member,   living or deceased, we respect and safeguard the privacy and confidentiality of   the information that we have about you.<br>
</p>
Privacy is one of your rights as a consumer as well as a UPMC   Health Plan member. It also is a right that you retain even when you are no   longer a member of UPMC Health Plan.<br>
<br>
But what does "private and   confidential" <strong>really</strong> mean?<br>
<br>
When you fill out your enrollment or   renewal application form and sign it — you are doing two important   things:<br>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>verifying the correctness and truthfulness of the information   that you have provided to us</li>
  <li>acknowledging that UPMC Health Plan can only use the   information we collect or receive about you and your family for very   well-defined routine purposes:</li>
  <ul class="disc">
    <li>arranging for the provision of healthcare treatment and   services to you and your family members that you are enrolling as dependents on   your application.</li>
    <li>making payment to doctors, hospitals, and other health care   professionals for the treatment and services you and your family receive. </li>
    <li>and performing certain health care operations that UPMC   Health Plan uses to monitor the quality of the healthcare coverage and services   that you have purchased for you and your family. These operations include   measurement and review of all our data to see how many of our members receive   certain services, such as childhood immunizations, mammograms, and other   preventive health services. All these measurements are used so that we can   assess how well we are doing in providing quality healthcare to all our   members.</li>
  </ul>
</ol>
<br>
Your personal information covers   a number of elements that all have one thing in common: they are all unique to   you, they can be used to identify you. This means that any files containing   information that includes such things as your name, address, social security   number and birth date are considered "protected health information." And it is   our responsibility to ensure the privacy of the protected health information of   all our members — prospective, current or former. <br>
<br>
The files that a   managed care organization collects or maintains are <strong>not</strong> things   such as medical charts or records, but include things such as the claims we have   received and paid for the services provided to you, or the health care premiums   that you or your company have paid. So whether the protected health information   we have is considered health information or non-public personal financial   information — we only use the information we have in our files within our   company and with our contracted providers, vendors and agents for the purposes   of your health care insurance. <br>
<br>
Other than for the well-defined, routine   purposes described above, or as required by law, the only one who has access to   your personal information and records is you.<br>
<br>
UPMC Health Plan does not   share your protected health information with anyone else — including employers —   unless you provide us with permission to do so. Any reports to employers about   the services provided to their employees are based only on total employee group   percentages and totals — and <strong>not</strong> on any individual member data or   information. <br>
<br>
Not only do all the physicians and providers in our network   know that your information is private and confidential, but our Health Plan   employees know that too. In fact, we have training programs for our employees to   ensure that they know the procedures they need to follow to make sure that your   information — <strong>whether in oral, written or electronic format</strong> — is secure   and safeguarded. We will not disclose information for any purposes beyond the   provision of your health care coverage, unless authorized by you in writing or   required to do so by law.<br>
<br>
If we have any additional programs that we feel   would be beneficial to you and that would require us to use your specific   personal information in order to let you participate in the program, we would   contact you and let you know all the details. We would request your permission   and signed authorization before we would use your personal information for   anything other than routine purposes that we have explained. If you decline such   a request, your information will not be part of the special program   enrollment.<br>
<br>
You undoubtedly have heard a great deal about privacy in the   news — especially as concerns federal legislation about privacy of health   information. In addition to any new legislation, all health insurance carriers   and health care providers are dealing with the Health Insurance Portability and   Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and several important sets of regulations   that government agencies have recently issued for HIPAA implementation and   compliance. In fact, because the HIPAA Privacy Regulations require doctors,   hospitals, health care insurers as well as employee benefit plans that are   involved in your health care to have a "<strong><a href="#hipaa">Notice of Privacy   Practices</a></strong>", you will probably be receiving several of these   notices.<br>
<br>
So, in addition to this Privacy Statement, UPMC Health Plan's   Notice of Privacy Practices will give you even more specific information and   details about how we ensure the privacy of your protected health information.   The Notice will also explain all the rights that you have concerning the privacy   of your health information, and how you can exercise those rights.<br>
<br>
UPMC   Health Plan, through its Compliance Committee and Quality Improvement Committee   — monitors all applicable laws and government regulations. We continually review   our policies and procedures to ensure that we are meeting the needs of privacy   laws and our commitment to our members. As new laws are passed and new   regulations are issued or clarified, we will be providing you with revised   information with any changes or updates.<br>
<br>
If you have any questions   concerning your right to the privacy and confidentiality of your personal   information and data that have been entrusted to UPMC Health Plan, please   contact our Member Services Department at the phone number on the back of your   ID Card. <br>
