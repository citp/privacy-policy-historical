our Web site when we may need personal information from you. By "personal

as your email address, IP address, password and user name. We may disclose in 
aggregate form our statistical analyses or demographics of users to third parties,

inquiries, to enforce the Terms of Use, or to defend itself in the event of litigation. 
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer 
our Web site. We also can use the IP address to verify the identity of perpetrators

sell any of your personal information to third parties. However, by using this 
site's services, you assume the risk that a court or government agency may order 
UploadOrb.com to disclose your submission and/or personally identifying information 
about you, or that a litigant, a court, a grand jury, or government agency may 
subpoena that information. We do not disclose the identities of ours users unless 
we are legally required to do so. If a governmental agency (for example, law enforcement 
agencies, US Attorneys' offices or similar governmental agencies) sends us a subpoena, 
we will comply with it. We will attempt to notify you of such a subpoena or other 
legal process by sending a notice by electronic mail to the most recent e-mail 
address you have provided to us. The notice will include basic information concerning 
the subpoena, court order, or legal process (i.e., name of lawsuit, case number, 
place of filing, party issuing subpoena, the court where the subpoena was issued, 
contact information, deadline by which we plan to comply with the process, etc.). 
UploadOrb.com may need to consult its own attorneys. In doing so, UploadOrb.com 
may disclose personal information to its attorneys.</p><p>Cookies<br>There is 
a technology called "cookies" which can be used to provide you with

site can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system. Some UploadOrb.com 
pages use cookies so that we can better serve you when you visit and then return 
to our site. We use cookies to deliver information specific to your interests 
and to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit 
certain areas of our Web site.</p></div>
