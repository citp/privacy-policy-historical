However, all information about you stored on our site will never be released to anyone without your consent. Please read on for more information on ABF U-Pack Moving's commitment to your privacy.

## Where is my information saved and protected?

Your personal and shipment information is stored in a central, secure source in our mainframe system. All calls from the Internet to access this information must pass through our secure site.

## How does U-Pack protect my credit card information?

All credit card information is encrypted by digital certificates using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). Credit card information is then stored on a computer that is not connected to the Internet. For more information about SSL, read the Secure Sockets Layer at the Verisign site.

## Does the U-Pack site use cookies?

Certain information is stored in your cookie file; however, none of your personal or shipment information is stored in cookies. We believe cookies provide a safe and secure way to improve the usability of the site. Please note that we will never use cookies to find demographic information.

## Will ABF U-Pack Moving disclose the information it collects to third parties?

We employ other companies and individuals to perform services for us, such as analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, and providing additional customer service. They have access to your information as necessary to perform those services for us, but they are not permitted to use it for any other purposes. Otherwise, unless approved by you, ABF U-Pack Moving will not sell, rent or trade your information to others. In other words, all information about you stored on our site will never be released to anyone without your consent.

Please note that by using the ABF U-Pack Moving Web site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by ABF U-Pack Moving. If we decide to change this privacy policy, alterations will be posted to this page. ABF U-Pack Moving is committed to protecting your privacy.

Please note that we updated this privacy policy on May 4, 2005 to clarify that we share information with companies that assist us in providing services to our customers, and they may only use that information to assist us, not for their own purposes. What has not changed is that we will not sell, rent, or trade your information to others without your consent.

We practice permission marketing. If you would like to remove yourself from receiving future messages please visit our [opt out page](https://web.archive.org/un.asp). In any event, ABF will never provide your e-mail address to third parties.
