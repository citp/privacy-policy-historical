To collect this important information, UPI and UPI's online partners may use Web servers, beacons and cookies to do all or some of the following: (1) track user activity on UPI.com to generate site usage reports, (2) record registration information so the user does not need to re-enter it each time, (3) record user-specific information on what pages or other sites the user accesses or visits, and (4) record past activity at a site in order to provide better service when the users return to our site. The type of information collected includes user geographic location, which pages each user visits, ISP, GMT timeframe, referral and destination sources, as well as visit duration. This information may be disclosed to advertisers and other businesses in the form of anonymous, aggregate usage statistics (including "hits" on UPI.com) and demographics, but only in forms that do not reveal a user's identity. UPI's online partners, who serve ads when you visit our Web site and provide other online services, may also use beacons, cookies & other tracking technologies to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you and to track how ads are displayed and which ads are clicked on.
