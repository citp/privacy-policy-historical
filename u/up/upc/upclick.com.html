                <p> Online privacy is constantly evolving and Upclick.com plans to take all               reasonable efforts to maintain up to date and effective online privacy standards               and practices. We have linked every page of our website ("Website") to this page               for your convenience and you may also <a href="contactus.html"> contact us</a>&nbsp;with any questions or concerns that you may have.</p>
                <p> Upclick.com is committed to respecting your online privacy and recognizes your               need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable               information ("Personal Information") you share with us. In order to provide our               services, Upclick.com collects and uses your Personal Information provided               during your purchase.

This policy explains how we intend to treat your Personal               Information. </p>
                <p> If you choose to provide us with your Personal Information on our Website, we               may transfer that Information within Upclick.com or to Upclick.com’s third-party               service providers, across borders, and from your country or jurisdiction to               other countries or jurisdictions around the world. </p>
                <p> Upclick.com strives to comply with all applicable laws around the globe that are               designed to protect your privacy.

                <p> A cookie is a piece of data stored on the visitor's hard drive containing               information about the visitor that can only be read by the server that placed               cookie onto the visitor's hard drive. </p>
                <p> Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies.

In               addition, there are number of privacy-enhancing tools and software that you may               purchase that will enable you to identify and block cookies on a selective               basis. Please note that for some websites that require an authorization, cookies               are not optional.
