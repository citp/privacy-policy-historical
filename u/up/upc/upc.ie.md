# UPC Ireland - Footer - Chorus ntl: Privacy Policy

**DATA PROTECTION POLICY**

This Privacy Policy applies to all existing customers of UPC Ireland and its subsidiaries (collectively, “UPC,” “NTL,” “Chorus,” “we,” or “us”).  
UPC collects and uses certain types of information about people with whom it deals, to help it operate efficiently. Information may be held on current, past and prospective employees, suppliers, clients, customers and others with whom UPC communicates.

UPC may be required by law to collect and use certain types of information. This may be for security/statistical purposes to report to government departments, for example.

This personal information must be dealt with properly, irrespective of where it is collected from, or how it is recorded. The Data Protection Act 1988 as amended has statutory provisions which ensure personal information is dealt with properly.

UPC considers its operations are likely to be more effective and ultimately, more successful, if it handles personal information in accordance with the 6 principles of data protection set out in the Data Protection Act 1988. UPC is committed to providing information to its customers and those with whom it deals in such a way that its processes for dealing with personal information are transparent and efficient.

**The Principles Require that Personal Information:**

  * shall be processed fairly and lawfully; 
  * shall be obtained only for one or more specified and lawful purposes, and shall not be further processed in any manner incompatible with that purpose or those purposes; 
  * shall be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose or purposes for which they are processed;
  * shall be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; 
  * shall not be kept for longer than is necessary for those purposes;  

  * shall be processed in accordance with the rights of data subjects under the Act; 
  * appropriate technical and organisational measures shall be taken against unauthorised or unlawful processing of personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, personal data; 
  * shall not be transferred to a country or territory outside the European Economic Area unless that country or territory ensures an adequate level of protection for the rights and freedoms of data subjects in relation to the processing of personal data. 



**UPC applies these principles in the following ways:**

1\. UPC will ensure that personal information is collected and used fairly and will specify what the information collected will be used for.

2\. UPC will collect and process appropriate information. It will ensure only information that is necessary to fulfil UPC's statutory and operational needs and obligations will be collected. 

3\. UPC will ensure data held will be up to date and accurate, and will make sure that such data is held only as long as is necessary.

4\. UPC will put in place adequate processes and procedures to handle requests by people to see information that is held about them. The procedure will make specific arrangements for customers seeking to take advantage of a right to change information held about them.

5\. UPC considers the safeguarding of UPC personal information as paramount. It has in place extensive technical and organisational security measures to keep personal data secure. UPC has also put in place controls to ensure personal information does not get transferred to a location where data protection principles are at a different level to that applied by European legislators. 

**Implementation of Policy**

UPC has a Central Project Team dedicated to Data Protection implementation and has designated a Group Compliance Officer to be UPC's Data Protection Officer for the UPC group of companies.

The Project Team has identified key business areas where data protection awareness is a critical factor. These areas have to a greater awareness of data protection as the training programme on the intranet rolled out to all associates in February 2000.

UPC is constantly evaluating ways in which it can improve its internal and external processes. It keeps under review, management supervision and control of functions which habitually handles personal information and has standard procedures for handling personal information.

UPC Ireland has designated a Data Protection officer who acts as UPC Ireland’s contact point for advice and guidance on all data protection issues. Queries are logged on receipt and, where necessary, will receive a written response. As part of the compliance function, there are regular reviews of the types of queries received. This allows a proactive approach to resolving data protection issues that might arise, and improves overall compliance with data protection principles.
