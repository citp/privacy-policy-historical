This is the privacy and cookies policy for each of our website and mobile applications that we make available from time to time (Applications). The Site will be available for use in due course. The Site will be operated, and the Applications are provided, by ueni Limited (we, us and our). For the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998, we are the data controller. We are committed to protecting your privacy on-line. We appreciate that you do not want the personal information you provide to us distributed indiscriminately and here we explain how we collect information, what we do with it and what controls you have. By using the Site or any Applications, you consent to the collection and use of information in accordance with this privacy policy. We reserve the right to change this privacy policy from time to time by changing it on the Site or by updating the relevant Applications. This privacy policy was last updated on 1 June 2015.

We may collect and process the following information about you:

You are under no obligation to provide any such information. However, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with certain services.

We may, from time to time, run referral programmes or similar initiatives, such as a "Tell a Friend" programme, that invite you to provide us with the contact details of someone who is known to you who may find our products or services to be of interest. We will only use those contact details for the purpose of the relevant initiative (and not for general marketing purposes). By providing us with their details, you confirm that you have their permission to do so and must not provide us with the details of anyone from whom you do not have such permission. We reserve the right to identify you as the person who has made the referral in the message that is sent to them.
