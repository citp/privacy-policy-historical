**Boulder Brands USA Inc.**

**Privacy Policy**

** ** Your privacy is important to us. As such, we provide this privacy policy (this “Policy”) explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used at this Boulder Brands USA Inc. (“Boulder Brands”, “we” or “us”) site, and among Boulder Brands’s affiliated and operated websites, which includes any online or mobile sites, applications or services owned, operated or offered by or on behalf of Boulder Brands that collect data and display these terms (each a “Site”, collectively the “Sites”).

**The Information We Collect**

Boulder Brands collects many types of information in order to operate effectively and provide you the best products, services and experiences we can. This information includes:

  * Information you provide (such as your e-mail address, first and last name, home address or telephone number);
  * Information collected automatically (for example, we may use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies that collect non-personal information about your use of our sites, such as your IP address and information about your computer and web browser);
  * Information collected from other sources (for example, we may collect information from commercially available sources such as data aggregators and public databases).

  * Process job applications submitted online;
  * Share or post reviews of our products and services;
  * Enter you in sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions and notify you of the results; and
  * Contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.



**Geo-location Information**

If you are accessing a Site from a mobile device or through a mobile application, you may be asked to share your geo-location information with us so we can customize your experience on our Sites. If you agree to such collection, you will be able to turn off such data collection at any time by accessing the privacy settings of your mobile device and/or through the settings in the applicable mobile application.

**Mobile Device Advertising and Tracking**

We, our third party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, agencies, or our partners may also be collecting identifiers designed to enable advertising on your mobile device. However, depending on your device, you may be able to reset your mobile device’s advertising identifier at any time by accessing the device’s privacy settings. In addition, when using a mobile application you may receive tailored in-application advertisements. Each operating system, iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices and Windows for Microsoft devices, provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems in order to opt-out of tailored in-application advertisements.

**Information from Social Networks and Platforms**

Some of our Sites contain links to or integrations with other sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube, LinkedIn etc., whose information practices may be different than ours. When you engage with our content on or through third party social networking sites, plug-ins or applications, you may allow us to have access to certain Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information from your social media profile (e.g., name, e-mail address, photo, gender, birthday, location, user files like photos and videos, your list of friends, people you follow and/or who follow you, the posts or the ‘likes’ you make, etc.) to deliver the content or as part of the operation of the Site. We may also obtain Non-Personally Identifiable Information (e.g., content viewed and information about advertisements within the content you have been shown or may have clicked on through third-party platforms) from your interaction with our content.

Through some social networking sites’ privacy settings, you can control what information you share. For a description on how social networking sites handle your information, please refer to their privacy policies and terms of use.

**How We Share Your Personal Information**

Boulder Brands does not sell, rent, lease or disclose your personal information to unaffiliated third parties. We may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your personally identifiable information is not transferred to the third party. Boulder Brands may also share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to Boulder Brands, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.

In addition, we may disclose information where we think it’s necessary to investigate or prevent an actual or suspected crime or injury to ourselves or others, if required by law, or in response to a request from law enforcement authorities or other government officials.

During the normal course of our business, Boulder Brands may sell or purchase assets or equity. If another entity acquires us or any of our assets, information we have collected about you may be transferred to such entity. In addition, if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, such information may be considered an asset of ours and may be sold or transferred to third parties. Should a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to require that the transferee use personally identifiable information provided through this Site in a manner that is consistent with this Policy.

**How We Protect Your Information  **

Boulder Brands takes reasonable precautions to secure your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Boulder Brands maintains safeguards to protect your personal information such as:

  * Storing data in controlled facilities;
  * Company-wide training on privacy and data security;
  * Limiting access to personal information to employees who need that access to perform their jobs; and
  * HTTPS encryption.



Users are warned, however, that the Internet and electronic databases may be subject to interception, and you provide such information at your own risk.

**Choice and Control Over Your Personal Information**

**Children’s Privacy**

Our sites are intended for general audiences and Boulder Brands is mindful of the need to protect the privacy of children under the age of 13. At Sites or areas of Sites directed to children under the age of 13, Boulder Brands follows the guidelines established by the Children’s Advertising Review Unit and the requirements under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

We may ask visitors to enter a birthdate to restrict those who are underage from accessing certain Sites, areas or features. Boulder Brands does not collect and store personal information online from children who are under the age of 13 without the consent of a parent or a legal guardian, except as authorized by law and described in this Policy. In any Site or area of a Site directed to children under 13, Boulder Brands does not require children to disclose more information than reasonably necessary to participate in online activities.

Boulder Brands may collect a child’s first name and e-mail address without parental consent for the sole purpose of responding to a one-time question or request from a child, or in connection with certain sweepstakes or contests, but Boulder Brands will promptly delete this information after providing a response or at the end of the promotion. When a child under 13 seeks to participate in an activity that will require multiple online contacts, such as signing up for an online newsletter, or for certain internal marketing activities, Boulder Brands may also ask the child for a parent’s or guardian’s e-mail address to notify them and obtain permission or provide them with an opportunity to opt-out of that activity. Boulder Brands may collect additional personally identifiable information from a child, such as the child’s address, in connection with special offers, sweepstakes, contests, and games, so it can award prizes. Upon proper identification, any parent can review any personal information we have collected from their child, if we are still maintaining the information in our operational database. They may also request that the information be deleted from our database, and refuse to permit further collection or use of their child’s information. If you are a parent and wish to exercise these rights, please contact the Online Team at [webmaster@pinnaclefoodscorp.com](mailto:webmaster@pinnaclefoodscorp.com).
