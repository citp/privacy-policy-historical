We will occasionally provide an online program for children. When children participate in such a program they may be required to provide their personal information, which will be stored in our database. We will use this information to contact them for the purposes of the program and to notify them of any other programs for children that we may offer at another time. It is our policy not to request or accept donations from anyone under 18.

Financial Information is personally identifiable data you submit that may include the amount of a gift or payment, preferred payment method, a credit card number, debit tracking number, or other information required to complete a financial transaction.

The USHMM collects such financial information in a secure manner and discards such information after processing is complete. The USHMM employs error-checking procedures to make certain transactions are processed in an accurate, complete, and timely manner. Independent internal and external audits are conducted to ensure the privacy, security, and appropriateness of these transactions.

While we make efforts to choose our links carefully, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policy of linked Web sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies on those Web sites.
