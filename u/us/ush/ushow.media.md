Security

We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to guard against unauthorized or unlawful processing of the information collected and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, your personal data.

Furthermore, we have implemented procedures to ensure that your information is only made available to such designated staff as necessary to carry out the stated purposes that we have communicated to you.

In addition, we recommend that you do your part in protecting yourself from unauthorized access to your account by ensuring no one else uses your machine when you are logged in, by logging off from the Site when it is not in use and by keeping your password confidential.

(a) Personal information that is documented on paper will be shredded or incinerated.  
(b) Personal information that is saved in the form of electronic files will be destroyed by technical means making the records non-reproducible.
