## Collection And Use Of Information

**Data Collected or Received from You**

Our primary goals in collecting information are

  * to provide and improve our Services,
  * to administer your use of the Services (including your Account, if you are an Account holder),
  * to provide you with updates, security alerts and support and administrative notices and
  * to otherwise enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services.



_Personally Identifiable Information_. If you use our services we may collect certain information that can be used to identify you, such as your name, email address, profile photo, location and phone number (“ **PII** ”).

_Account Information_. If you create an Account to use our Services we will collect your name and email address. Optionally we may also collect your profile photo and, if you sign up for notifications, your phone number. 

_Information You Provide to Us When Using the Services_. We will also collect any information and PII that you choose to submit via the Services, whether you hold an Account with us or not. For example, if you are an Ushahidi user, we will collect any PII that you provide when you post a report or fill out a survey created by a Primary Account Holder through the Ushahidi Services. Depending on the information you choose to submit, this information may be information that can be used to identify you, such as your name, photo, email address, phone number or location; or it may be information that is not considered PII because it cannot be used by itself to identify you.

_Information from TenFour Users_. If you are a TenFour user, as the Controller of your data, your employer may share your PII with us, including your name, phone number, address, emergency contact, location and email address, so that we can provide the TenFour Services.

_Billing Information_. When you purchase a paid subscription to any of our Services, we will collect via Chargebee and Braintree, our third-party payment processors, your credit card number, credit card expiration date and billing address to complete your order. The information provided to Chargebee is subject to the Chargebee Privacy Policy (available at[ https://www.chargebee.com/privacy.html](https://www.chargebee.com/privacy.html)). You should read the Chargebee Privacy Policy to learn about Chargebee’s information collection and usage.

_Information Related to Use of the Services_. Our software or servers automatically record certain information about how a person uses our Services (we refer to this information as “ **Log Data** ”), including both Account holders and non-Account holders. Log Data may include information such as a user’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, URL request, browser type, operating system, the web page that a user was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a user browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services that a user clicked on and other statistics. We use Log Data to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) Log Data to improve and enhance our Services by expanding their features and functionality. We may use a person’s IP address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how our Services are used.

_Information Sent by Your Mobile Device_. We collect certain information that your mobile device sends when you use our Services, like the manufacturer, model, operating system, and version of your device, as well as information about your use of our Services. We use this information in order to debug flaws in our software, identify device profiles we need to better serve, and identify versions of our software we need to support. 

_Location Information_. When you use our Apps, we may collect and store information about your location by converting your IP address into a rough geo-location or by accessing your mobile device’s GPS coordinates or coarse location if you enable location services on your device. We may use location information to improve and personalize our Services for you. If you do not want us to collect location information, you may disable that feature on your mobile device. You may also choose to send your location to us when you use certain of our Services, such as Ushahidi, TenFour, SMSsync or CrowdMap.

_Information Collected Using Cookies and other Web Technologies_. Like many website owners and operators, we collect certain information when you visit one of our Sites or use our Services, even when you are not logged in. We use automated data collection tools such as Cookies and Web Beacons to collect certain information.

_Use of Cookies and Web Beacons:_

“ **Cookies** ” are small text files that are placed on your hard drive by a Web server when you access our Services. We may use both session Cookies and persistent Cookies to identify that you’ve logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use Cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve our Services. Unlike persistent Cookies, session Cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept Cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting Cookies. Please note, however, that if you don’t accept Cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Some third-party services providers that we engage (including third-party advertisers) may also place their own Cookies on your hard drive. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of Cookies and does not include use of Cookies by such third parties.

“ **Web Beacons** ” (also known as Web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how many visitors view our Services, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising. Unlike Cookies, which are stored on the user’s hard drive, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web pages (or in an e-mail).

Public identification of all contributed content may include, but is not limited to, display of your Account name and your location.

## Data Protection Laws

Under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the General Data Protection Regulation or “GDPR,” we rely on the following legal basis to process personal data:

## The Security Of Your Information

We take reasonable administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect the information that we collect from or about you (including your PII) from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.

Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information.

## How Long We Keep Your Data

**Deployment data**  


Ushahidi deployment data - including users, contacts (sms, email, twitter), and survey data - are retained as long as the deployment exists.

**User data**

Deployment user data is maintained as long as the deployment and user exist. If the user is deleted by the deployment administrator, all their data is removed. Data may remain in offline backups indefinitely.

**Customer and payment data**

We will retain your billing and payment information as needed to provide you services. Even if you close your account with Ushahidi, we will still retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. However, we will identify your account in our database as “deleted” or “closed".

**Support requests**

If you contact our support team - through [support@ushahidi.com](mailto:support@ushahidi.com) or the in application chat - we retain those messages indefinitely, unless you request we delete them.

## Links To Other Sites

Our Services may contain links to websites and services that are owned or operated by third parties (each, a “ **Third-Party Service** ”). Any information that you provide on or to a Third-Party Service or that is collected by a Third-Party Service is provided directly to the owner or operator of the Third-Party Service and is subject to the owner’s or operator’s privacy policy. We’re not responsible for the content, privacy or security practices and policies of any Third-Party Service. To protect your information we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of all Third-Party Services that you access.  


## International Transfer

Your PII may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you’re located outside the United States and choose to provide your PII to us, we may transfer your PII to the United States and process it there.  


## Our Policy Toward Children

Our Services are not directed to children under 16 and we do not knowingly collect PII from children under 16. If we learn that we have collected PII of a child under 16 we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as possible.  


## Contacting A Regulator

You can reach the ICO visiting their website: [www.ico.org.uk/concerns](http://www.ico.org.uk/concerns).
