**Personal Data we collect**

In general, you can browse the Site without providing us with any of personal information about yourself. You don’t have to create an account to use some of the uShip services, such as viewing public uShip profiles or public listings. However even when browsing, uShip may receive some personal information from you, like the device you’re using and your IP address.

In order to use most services or features on the Site, you must first complete the registration form and create a username and password. During the registration process, you are required to give contact information such as name, address, phone number, and email address. Note, once you agree to provide us with personal information, you are no longer anonymous to us.

If you choose to use our services, we may require you to provide contact and identity information, billing information, and other personal information as indicated on the forms throughout the Site. Under some circumstances we may require some additional financial information. Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and which are optional. You always have the option to not provide information by choosing not to use a particular service or feature.

If you choose to list, quote, or match on the Site, we collect information about your activity and behavior. We also collect other users’ comments about you in our feedback area.

Additionally, as part of the registration process, uShip allows members registering as a service provider the option to submit certain commercial information such as a commercial service provider’s license number, DOT number, Motor Carrier (MC) number, and/or any other authority a service provider chooses to include. It is up to each member individually to provide this information. uShip will not validate this information but will allow uShip’s 3rd party partners, SaferWatch and SaferWatch CertData, provided by Assure Assist, to access this information in order to obtain relevant information such as authority, insurance coverages and other business information as provided in FMCSA records and other information sources.

Only service providers that submit such commercial, identifying information on the uShip site will be eligible to be officially SaferWatch Monitored, which is signified by a seal on the member profile. This seal and all other public information that a service provider submits can be viewed by other members on the member’s profile page under the About Me section. At any point in time a service provider can choose to opt out of the 3rd party SaferWatch verification program from their uShip account within the edit profile section.

If you choose to post messages on our community discussion forums, Shipment Listing Q&A boards, or leave feedback for other members, we will collect that information you provide to us. We retain this information as necessary to resolve disputes, provide customer support and troubleshoot problems as permitted by law. See “Community Discussion Forums” section below.

If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the Site, we may collect such information into a file specific to you.

From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on the Site. If you choose to participate, we will request certain personal information, including your email address, from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information and demographic information. We will not share the personal information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.

If you choose to participate in the Bring Your Own Rates program, you will be asked to provide your login credentials for your carrier accounts as part of the enrollment process. uShip collects this information for the sole purpose of uploading your rates to the uShip Platform. All information provided is protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**Tracking Technologies  **

Technologies such as: cookies and similar technologies are used by uShip and our marketing partners, affiliates, and customer support and fraud prevention service providers.

**Behavioral Targeting/Re-targeting**

We partner with third parties to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partners may use technologies such as cookies and similar technologies to gather information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking _[here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/)_ (or if located in the European Union click _[here](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/)_ ).

**Information Sharing and Disclosure  **

As a matter of policy, we do not sell, rent or share any of your personal information, including your email address, to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. The profile you create on the Site will be publicly accessible unless otherwise indicated. You may change the privacy settings of your profile through your account portal. However, the following describes some of the ways that your personal information may be disclosed in the normal scope of business to provide our services.

**uShip Community:** Your uShip username is displayed throughout the Site and is therefore available to the public. All of your activities on the Site will be identifiable to your username. Other people can see your quotes, shipments you have listed, your feedback rating and associated comments, your postings on the site, and so on. Therefore, if you associate your name with your username, the people you have revealed your name to will be able to personally identify your uShip activities. If you are involved in a transaction, we have features that allow parties to the transaction to view your email address and obtain your contact information to help complete the transaction. Further, we may send out notices to you or other community members regarding suspicious activity or policy violations on the site. Additionally, we may share your written correspondence, including emails to the other party to your transaction as part of the dispute resolutions process. To request removal of your personal information from the uShip community, contact us at our contact information found below. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

**External Service Providers:** There may be separate services offered by third parties that we refer to as external service providers that may be complementary to your use of the site. If you choose to use these separate services, disclose information to the external service providers, and/or grant them permission to collect information about you, then their use of your information is governed by their privacy policy. We do not disclose your personal information, including your email address, to external service providers unless you provide your explicit consent. With your consent we may provide some of your personal information to the external service provider offering such services, for your convenience. To prevent our disclosure of your personal information to an external service provider, you can decline such consent or simply not use their services. Because we do not control the privacy practices of these third parties, you should evaluate their practices before deciding to use their services. Examples of external service providers include _[McGriff, Seibels& Williams of Oregon, Inc.](http://www.mcgriff.com/)_ and _[Roanoke](http://www.roanoketrade.com/)_ which provide the uShip Cargo Insurance and facilitate the claims process.

**Internal Service Providers for Our Operations:** We may use third parties that we refer to as internal service providers to facilitate or outsource one or more aspects of the business (sometimes utilizing framing techniques), product and service operations that we provide to you and therefore we may provide some of your personal information, including your email address, directly to these internal service providers. Any sensitive information that is transmitted to internal service providers involved in any payment processing functions will be encrypted or tokenized. These internal service providers' are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit their use of the information we provide them for any other purpose except to facilitate the specific outsourced uShip related operation, unless you have explicitly agreed or given your prior permission to them for additional uses. If you provide additional information to an internal service provider directly, then their use of your personal information is governed by their applicable privacy policy. Examples of internal service providers include Stripe which is involved in payment processing functions, PayPal which is involved in the credit card processing function, and Grizella’s SaferWatch tool (including SaferWatch CertData, provided by Assure Assist) which monitors all participating service provider’s licensure and insurance information.

**Frames:** Some of our pages utilize framing techniques to serve content to from our partners while preserving the look and feel of our site. Please be aware that you are providing your personal information to these third parties and not to _[http://www.uship.com](http://www.uship.com/)_.

**Legal Requests:** uShip cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce laws, such as: intellectual property rights, fraud and other rights, to help protect you and the uShip community from bad actors. Therefore, in response to a verified request by law enforcement or other government officials relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your name, city, state, telephone number, email address, user history, fraud complaints, and quoting and listing history without a subpoena. Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and our ability to keep the community free from bad actors, we will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement or other government officials without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to: prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss; or report suspected illegal activity.

Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose personal information, including your email address, to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the Site. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private. See “Security Section” below.

We collect your location-based information for the purpose of locating a place that you may be searching for in your area. We will only share this information with our mapping provider for the sole purpose of providing you this service. You may opt-out of location based services at any time by editing the setting at the device level or by emailing us at _[privacy@uShip.com](mailto:privacy@uShip.com)_.
