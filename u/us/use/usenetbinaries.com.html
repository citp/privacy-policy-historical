</p>

<h4>Information Collection</h4>
<p>
UsenetBinaries.com is the sole owner of the information collected on UsenetBinaries.com.
UsenetBinaries.com collects information from our users at several different
points on our Web site.
</p>

<i>Registration</i>

<p>In order to use this Web site, a user must first complete the registration form.
During registration a user is required to provide contact information and unique identifiers (such as username, password,
and email address). We use this information to contact the user about services
on our site for which he has expressed interest and to authenticate access to
registered user site features. 
</p>

<i>Upgrade</i>

<p>
We request information from the user on our
upgrade form. A user must provide contact information (such as billing address
and phone number) and financial information (such as credit card number,
expiration date). This information is
used for billing purposes and to fill customer’s orders.
If we have trouble processing an order, the user will be contacted via email 
address or billing information as necessary.
</p>

<h4>Information Use</h4>

<p>
UsenetBinaries.com uses information about our users for registration, billing, authentication,
site features, customer communications, and site security. Site features
include the downloading of images and videos, uploading of images, and
searching for site media. 
</p>

<h4>Profile</h4>

<p>
We store information that we collect through cookies,
database records, and log files. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users, 
which details their <b>optional</b> viewing preferences (e.g. ‘Group Favorites’).
If a user does not explicitly store viewing
preferences, none are collected or stored. Consequently, this optional
information is tied to the users personally identifiable information to improve
the content of the site for the user. This profile is used to tailor a user’s
visit to our Web site. We do not share
your profile with other third parties. Your profile is stored with your
username and password, but not with any personally identifiable data from your
billing information. Also, we do not reveal personal viewing preferences in any
customer support tools.
</p>

<h4>Cookies</h4>

<p>
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information
about the user. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session 
ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. 
A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user’s hard drive
for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following
Internet browser help file directions.
</p>

<p>
By setting a cookie on our site, users would not have to log in a password more
than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If users reject the cookie, they may still use our site.
the user will not be able to use registered user features
such as viewing full media or performing searches. Persistent cookies enable us
to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our
site. See the Profile”section.
</p>

<p>
Cookies contain information collected at signup time, including IP address, referrer,
and username.
</p>

<h4>Log Files</h4>

<p>
Like most standard Web site servers we use log files.&nbsp;
This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet
service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp,
and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s
movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for
aggregate use. IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information which is used only in matters of site abuse
and security. We use a log analyzing utility which uses log files to analyze user movement in the aggregate.
</p>

<h4>Communications from the Site</h4>

<i>Special Offers and Updates</i>

<p>
We send all new members a validation email containing a hyperlink which validates
their email address in order to complete registration on our site. Free members
will occasionally receive information on products, services, and special deals.
Paid users do not receive these emails.
</p>

<i>Service Announcements</i>

<p>
On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related
announcement. For instance, if our
service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an
email. Generally, users may not opt-out
of these communications, though they can deactivate their account.
</p>

<i>Customer Service</i>

<p>
We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in
regards to issues relating to their account via email and our web-based contact
form.
</p>

<h4>Sharing</h4>

<i>Legal Disclaimer</i>

<p>
Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal
information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such
action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order
or legal process served on our Web site.
</p>

<i>Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</i>

<p>
We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers.
This is not linked to any personally identifiable information.
</p><p>

</p><p>
<b>We do not share personal information with third parties with the following exceptions.</b>
</p>

<i>Third Party Intermediaries</i>

<p>
We use credit card processing companies to authenticate and bill users for
services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally
identifiable information for any secondary purposes.  We may also use a
third party intermediary to assist us in analyzing broad demographic
information about our site traffic.
</p>

<i>Business Transitions</i>

<p>
In the event UsenetBinaries.com goes through a business transition, such as a
merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets,
users’ personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets
transferred.
</p>

<i>Site Security and Abuse</i>

<p>
In the event an attempt is made by any user to disrupt our service, circumvent our Terms of Service,
or otherwise engage in activity which causes us concern regarding the normal operation of our service
or site security, we reserve the right to share personal information with ISP administrators in order
to resolve the issue and/or personally identify the user for further action.
</p>

<h4>Choice/Opt-out</h4>

<p>
Since all personal information is not optionally shared with third parties, there is
no opt-out of information use at UsenetBinaries.com. Promotional emails are a
mandatory condition of free accounts.
</p>

<h4>Links</h4>

<p>
This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we,
UsenetBinaries.com, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other
sites. We encourage our users to be
aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and
every Web site that collects personally identifiable information.
This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.
</p>

<h4> Surveys and Contests</h4>

<p>
From time-to-time our site may request information from users via surveys or
contests. Participation in these
surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice
whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such
as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip
code). Contact information will be used
to notify the winners and award prizes. Anonymous Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or
improving the use and satisfaction of this site. Users’ personally identifiable information is not shared with
third parties unless we give prior notice and choice. Though we may use an
intermediary to conduct these surveys or contests, they may not use users’
personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.
</p>

<h4>Email to a Friend</h4>

<p>
If a user elects to use our Email To a Friend service for sending images to a friend, we
ask them for the friend’s email address. UsenetBinaries.com will automatically send the friend a one-time email
inviting them to visit the site containing the selected media and associated
images. UsenetBinaries.com stores this information for the sole purpose of
sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.
</p>

<h4>Upload Form</h4>

<p>
UsenetBinaries.com
allows users to upload files to the Usenet network, which will then be
distributed worldwide according to the operation of the Usenet global system.
The post will include the user's email address they used to sign up with
UsenetBinaries.com. Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose
personal information online - for example on message boards, through e-mail,
Usenet, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by
others. In short, by posting personal information online that is publicly
accessible, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.
</p>

<h4>Security</h4>

<p>
This Web site takes every precaution to protect our
users’information. When users submit
sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both
online and off-line.
</p>

<p>
When our upgrade form asks users to enter sensitive
information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that
information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in
the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the 
bottom of Web browsers such
as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as
opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just surfing. In some cases, an
upgrade form may not display the lock as the form is not displayed on a secure
page. However, anything typed into that form will be submitted encrypted, and
any re-display of the form with the information enclosed (for, example, data
correction purposes) will be sent over SSL.
</p>

<p>
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive
information online, we also do everything in our power to protect
user-information off-line. All of our
users’information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is
restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our
billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to
personally identifiable information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and
privacy practices. When new policies
are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we
place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users’ information is
protected. Finally, the servers that
store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, behind a
locked cage in a locked facility.
</p>

<p>
If users have any questions about the security at our
Web site, users can contact us via http://www.usenetbinaries.com/contact.
</p>

<h4>Correcting/Updating Personal Information</h4>

<p>
If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone,
email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we
provide a way to correct or update users’ personally identifiable information.
This can usually be done at https://admin.usenetbinaries.com/cgi-bin/admin
or by emailing our Customer Support at http://www.usenetbinaries.com/contact
</p>

<h4>Notification of Changes</h4>

<p>
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy
statement so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we
use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
If, however, we are going to use users’personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at
the time of collection we will notify users by posting a notice on our Web site
for 30 days.
</p>

<h4>Contact Information</h4>

<p>
If users have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please
contact us at http://www.usenetbinaries.com/contact.
