electronic forms which you must fill in when you order a product or service, subscribe to a newsletter, request
information or take part in a survey or competition. Data may also be compiled when you use a service that is offered
on the website.
The personal data you fill in via these channels is stored in files held by Belgacom SA under public law (Bd. du Roi
Albert II, 27, B-1030 Brussels). This data is used to provide you with the service or information that you requested, to
improve service quality and to inform you about Belgacom products, services and special offers. The compiled data can
be combined with data about your use of other Belgacom services which will allow us to tailor our offers more closely to
your needs.
This data and your identification details can also be shared with Belgacom Group subsidiaries in order to keep you
informed of products and services offered by the entire Belgacom Group.
If you do not wish to receive information about Belgacom products and services or if you object to your data being
shared with Belgacom Group subsidiaries, please read the instructions at the end of this text on how to inform us of

and the information you provide us.

collected data is not disclosed to third parties unless explicitly specified or the communication of your data is required
by law.
