Our website exploits online Google AdWords and Google Display Network promotion systems. On this topic, Google guarantees its customers and users’ data privacy. Google AdWords enables a cookie on your computer. The cookie only remains valid for 30 days and is not used to identify personal data. If the user visits certain pages in the AdWords customer’s website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and the customer are able to recognise the user who clicked on the ad and who was sent to this page.

### 7\. Risk Ident GmbH

We employ the services of the IT Security Agency Risk Ident GmbH (Zippelhaus 2, 20457 Hamburg, Deutschland) for our website. All communication between us and Risk Ident takes place with the sole purpose of combating fraud when using our website.

#### a) Data Storage

Risk Ident collects and processes specific data on our users about the configuration of the user’s end device (“device-specific data”), raw data from the TCP/IP connection and data on the use of our website. In the process, tracking technology, such as cookies and JavaScript elements and Shockwave Flash objects are used which are integrated into the website. Cookies are text files which save the visited website via the browser onto your computer and which contain information about the use of this website. The JavaScript and Shockwave Flash objects make it possible to read information on the user’s end device, which is automatically transmitted after each internet session. For technical reasons, the user’s IP address is collected and processed by Risk Ident and encoded by Risk Ident within seconds. Risk Ident saves the information anonymously onto a databank for fraud prevention.

#### b) Data Retrieval

Whenever a user concludes a contract or aims to conclude a contract over our website, e.g. by setting up a user account or by beginning the check-out process in order to buy a certain item, we call up a risk assessment on Risk Ident’s databank which has been saved there for the user’s end device. This risk assessment, based inter alia on information ascertains (a) if the user’s end device is currently communicating or has communicated in the past a proxy connection, (b) if the end device has recently dialed into various internet service providers, (c) if the end device exhibits or has exhibited a frequent change in geo-reference, (d) how many internet transactions have been made in recent weeks (whereby we are not informed about the type of transaction), and (e) how probable it is that the end device saved in the Risk Ident data bank really belongs to the user. (The result of this risk assessment helps us to prevent fraud on our website. The data, however, is not a sole criterion to either complete or terminate a purchase).

### 8\. Survey Tools

Customer satisfaction surveys are carried out using a tool supplied by an external service provider (SurveyMonkey). Please ensure that the provider of this tool implements its own [ data protection strategy](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/policy/privacy-policy/). Participation in customer surveys is voluntary. The customer survey is configured so that IP addresses or e-mails are not collected automatically. E-mail addresses will not be disclosed to third parties. The SurveyMonkey website uses Cookies.
