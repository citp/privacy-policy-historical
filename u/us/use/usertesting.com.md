### 2.1 GENERAL

The following sections describe the specifics of both types of groups from which data is collected: Customers and Testers.

### 2.2 Testers

Testers should be aware that in taking part in User Tests, they may be disclosing information that could make them personally identifiable to UserTesting Customers. Testers should be aware that they are responsible for the content provided during their User Tests. UserTesting will not process Personal Data for purposes or by other means than as instructed by Customers or as otherwise necessary to provide the Services.

### 2.3 Customers

In order to provide the Services to Customers, UserTesting collects certain types of data from its Customers. Further, Customers may collect or request information from Testers when utilizing the Services, subject to the terms of service entered into between UserTesting and all Customers.

### 2.3.1 Collection of Customer Data

During a Customer’s utilization of the Platform and Services, Customers may be requested to provide information such as name, company name, email address, address, telephone or other relevant Personal Data (collectively “ **Customer Data** ”). This Personal Data is used by UserTesting to identify each Customer and provide them with Services, support, billing and to meet other contractual obligations. UserTesting will delete Customer’s Personal Data upon request from such Customer, unless complying with such request would violate an applicable law, statute or other contractual obligation.

### 2.3.2 Collection of Tester Data By Customers

User Tests are created by Customers. As such, it is the Customer’s responsibility to ensure that collection and processing of information provided by Testers during User Tests (“ **Tester Data** ”) is done in accordance with applicable law. UserTesting will not process Tester Data for other purposes or by other means than as instructed by Customers or as necessary to provide the Services.

Tester Data includes data from all Testers uploaded, transferred or manually entered during a User Test. Tester Data may include Personal Data, including personal contact information such as name, address, telephone number, email address or other personal demographic information. For Customers in the EEA (defined below), or for Customers engaging Testers in the EEA, the Customer will be the “controller” as defined by the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“ **GDPR** ”) as further explained below.

### 2.4 Geographical Location

For UserTesting Customers and Testers, all Personal Data shall be processed in data storage centers located in the United States.

### 2.4.1 Processing in the EEA

For Customers with accounts located in the EEA, all processing of Personal Data is performed in accordance with privacy rights and regulations following the EU Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 (the Directive), and the implementations of the Directive in local legislation. From May 25th, 2018, the Directive and local legislation based on the Directive will be replaced by the Regulations (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of Personal Data and on the free movement of such data, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and UserTesting’s processing will take place in accordance with the GDPR.

### 2.4.1.1 Controller and Processor (GDPR)

UserTesting processes Personal Data both as a Processor and as a Controller, as defined in the Directive and the GDPR:

UserTesting will be the Controller for User data, as outlined above in “Collection of Customer Data” section.

For Tester data collected during Customer’s utilization of the Platform and Services, as outlined in the “Collection of Tester Data” section, the Customer will be the Controller in accordance with Directive and GDPR, and UserTesting will be the Processor.

All data collected by UserTesting will be stored in secure hosting facilities provided by Amazon Web Services. UserTesting maintains a data processing agreement in place with its provider, ensuring compliance with the Directive and GDPR. All hosting is performed in accordance with the highest security regulations. All transfers of data internally in the EEA is done in accordance with this data processing agreement.

### 2.4.2 Processing Outside of the EEU

For Customers with accounts not located in the EEU, UserTesting processes data solely in data centers located in the United States of America. UserTesting has adopted reasonable physical, technical and organizational safeguards which substantially mirror the EU safeguards against accidental, unauthorized or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure, access, use or processing of the Customer’s data in UserTesting’s possession. UserTesting will promptly notify the Customer in the event of any known unauthorized access to, or use of, the Customer’s data.

Accordingly, UserTesting adheres to practices and policies that aim to safeguard all such data.

## 3\. RETENTION AND DELETION

UserTesting will keep information needed to provide the Services to Customers as long as there exists a valid business purpose, in accordance with applicable law and our Service and/or Tester Agreements, and will delete such data upon written request from a Customer or Tester, provided such deletion complies with all applicable laws or regulations. For Tester Data, Customers have control of the purpose for collecting data. Customers with an active UserTesting account will therefore have the responsibility to delete data if required.
