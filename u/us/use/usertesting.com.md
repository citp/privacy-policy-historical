# UserTesting.com Privacy Policy

We understand that your privacy is of the utmost importance to you. UserTesting.com is committed to protecting the privacy and confidential information of those who register. 

###  Your Personal Information

UserTesting.com collects personal information that you provide to us. Our software uses the personal information to personalize and manage the UserTesting.com website for you.

When you sign up with us, UserTesting.com logs you in automatically using your email address. This makes it easier for you as you don't have to create and remember a login identifier. The use of your email address for login also allows UserTesting.com the chance to email you a new password in case you forget or lose your old one. 

Anyone using UserTesting.com warrants and promises that they are 13 years of age or older. UserTesting.com does not intend to collect personally identifying information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13 we ask that you do not use this web service. 

**The personal information that you share with us is not going anywhere off of our site.** We won't sell your personal information to anyone. There might be one exception in the event UserTesting.com itself is sold. In this case we would transfer your personal information to our buyers so that they could continue to provide the same great UserTesting.com service.

UserTesting.com may disclose to authorized law enforcement personnel the personal data from anyone who poses a threat. This might include those that are attempting to commit fraud or those who conduct activities that could bring harm to others. We assume that this is not you so please don't worry.

All results you receive from UserTesting.com are private. You, of course, have the freedom to share them with others (if you'd like, you may share your videos under the [Creative Commons license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/))

UserTesting.com has a sophisticated security program intended to keep the information stored in our system protected from unauthorized access. We store your information in a secure data center located in the United States. Our system is configured with data encryption, or scrambling technologies and firewalls constructed to the highest industry standards. We also use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology that protects the data you send over the Internet. The bottom line is, when it comes to information security, we mean business.

When you visit UserTesting.com we may store information about your web session and assign you one or more 'cookies'. Your browser will store these cookies on your computer in a small text file. For example, when you decide to login as a UserTesting.com member, we store encrypted information in your browser so you don't have to login on every page.

Permanent cookie files remain on your computer's hard drive until you delete them manually using your browser or operating system software. You can enable your browser to refuse cookies, but doing so may disable access to some services and tools that we offer.

UserTesting.com reserves the right to modify this privacy statement at any time. If there are material changes to this statement on how UserTesting.com will use your personal information, we will prominently post these changes prior to implementing them. If you use our website after we post these changes, this indicates your acceptance of them. Regardless of later updates, we will follow the privacy practices described in this privacy statement at the time you provided us with your information. 

###  Your Videos

Videos and reviews that are done for your company will be kept confidential. Any samples that appear on our site weren't paid for.

If you have questions about our privacy policy, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20110602042029id_/http%3A//www.usertesting.com/contactus.aspx).
