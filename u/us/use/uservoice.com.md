# UserVoice - Privacy Policy

     UserVoice, Inc. ("UserVoice", "we" or "us") collects (a) the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail, (b) aggregate information concerning what pages consumers and/or users access or visit, and (c) information volunteered by the consumer (such as survey information and/or site registrations). The information we collect is used to improve the content of our Web pages and the quality of our service, and is not shared with or sold to other organizations for commercial purposes, except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances: 

  * It is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law.
  * We transfer information about you if UserVoice is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, UserVoice will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
  * We provide such information to trusted businesses or persons for the sole purpose of processing personally identifying information on our behalf. When this is done, it is subject to agreements that oblige those parties to process such information only on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
  * We provide such information to third parties who have entered into non-disclosure agreements with us.
  * We provide such information to a company controlled by, or under common control with, UserVoice for any purpose permitted by this Privacy Policy.
