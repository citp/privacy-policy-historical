# Privacy policy | UserEcho

UserEcho collects the email addresses of people who communicate with UserEcho via email, create accounts, or post topics. UserEcho also collects aggregate information on which pages users access or visit, and information volunteered by users (such as survey information and/or site registrations). The information UserEcho collects is used to improve the quality of our service, and is not shared with or sold to other organizations for commercial purposes, except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances: 

It is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law. 

We transfer information about you if UserEcho is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, UserEcho will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 

We provide such information to third parties who have entered into non-disclosure agreements with us. 

We provide such information to a company controlled by, or under common control with, UserEcho for any purpose permitted by this Privacy Policy.
