##### Right to file complaints with regulatory authorities

If there has been a breach of data protection legislation, the person affected may file a complaint with the competent regulatory authorities. The competent regulatory authority for matters related to data protection legislation is the Data Protection Officer of the German state in which our company is headquartered.

##### Right to data portability

You have the right to have data which we process based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract automatically delivered to yourself or to a third party in a standard, machine-readable format. If you require the direct transfer of data to another responsible party, this will only be done to the extent technically feasible.

##### SSL or TLS encryption

This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and for the protection of the transmission of confidential content, such as the inquiries you send to us as the site operator. You can recognize an encrypted connection in your browser's address line when it changes from "http://" to "https://" and the lock icon is displayed in your browser's address bar.

If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transfer to us cannot be read by third parties.

Dr. Jochen Notholt

80337 Munich

Telephone: +49-221-63060024  
Email: [privacy@userlike.com](mailto:privacy@userlike.com)

#### 4\. Applicants for Employment

The purpose of the data processing is the selection of applicants for an employment relationship. There are no plans to change these purposes.

Legal basis is § 26 BDSG (2017) in connection with Article 6 (1) (b) (employment contract) and Article 88 DS-GMO.

Applicant data is passed on internally to the responsible and decision-making employees. We also use service providers to process orders for the provision of services, in particular for the provision, maintenance and servicing of IT systems.

The data will be deleted three months after the end of the application process.

Personal data is required for the examination of the application and, if necessary, the subsequent conclusion of an employment contract. Without personal data, an application cannot be considered. However, applications can also be submitted without providing such information marked as voluntary.

In the course of the application process, data is processed by the service provider Hetzner. This processing is based on the conclusion of an order processing agreement under German law. A copy may be made available at any time by the Data Protection Officer.

#### 5\. Data collection on our website

##### Cookies

Some of our web pages use cookies. Cookies do not harm your computer and do not contain any viruses. Cookies help make our website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and saved by your browser.

Most of the cookies we use are so-called "session cookies." They are automatically deleted after your visit. Other cookies remain in your device's memory until you delete them. These cookies make it possible to recognize your browser when you next visit the site.

You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so that you can decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept or reject a cookie. Alternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically accept cookies under certain conditions or to always reject them, or to automatically delete cookies when closing your browser. Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of this website.

Cookies which are necessary to allow electronic communications or to provide certain functions you wish to use (such as the shopping cart) are stored pursuant to Art. 6 paragraph 1, letter f of GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the storage of cookies to ensure an optimized service provided free of technical errors. If other cookies (such as those used to analyze your surfing behavior) are also stored, they will be treated separately in this privacy policy.

##### Server log files

The website provider automatically collects and stores information that your browser automatically transmits to us in "server log files". These are:

  * Time of the server request,
  * Browser type and browser version,
  * IP-Address,
  * Operating system used,
  * Referrer URL.



These data will not be combined with data from other sources.

The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR, which allows the processing of data to fulfill a contract or for measures preliminary to a contract.

##### Contact form

Should you send us questions via the contact form, we will collect the data entered on the form, including the contact details you provide, to answer your question and any follow-up questions. We do not share this information without your permission.

We will, therefore, process any data you enter onto the contact form only with your consent per Art. 6 (1)(a) GDPR. You may revoke your consent at any time. An informal email making this request is sufficient. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.

We will retain the data you provide on the contact form until you request its deletion, revoke your consent for its storage, or the purpose for its storage no longer pertains (e.g. after fulfilling your request). Any mandatory statutory provisions, especially those regarding mandatory data retention periods, remain unaffected by this provision.

##### Live-Chat

Userlike uses a live chat of Userlike UG (haftungsbeschränkt), Probsteigasse 44-46, 50670 Cologne, Germany (yes, we use our own chat :-) ). You can use the live chat as a contact form to chat with our staff in near real time. At the start of the chat, personal data is collected.

  * Date and time of the call,
  * browser type/version,
  * IP address,
  * operating system used,
  * URL of the previously visited website,
  * amount of data sent.
  * First name, last name
  * email address



Depending on the course of the conversation with our employees, further personal data may arise in the chat, which are entered by you. The type of data depends strongly on your request or the problem you describe to us.

All our employees have been and will be trained on the subject of data protection and on the safe and confidential handling of customer data. All our employees are bound to confidentiality and have accordingly signed an addendum to the obligation to maintain confidentiality and to observe data protection in their employee contracts.

When you visit [userlike.com](https://userlike.com/), the chat widget is loaded as a JavaScript file from AWS Cloudfront. The chat widget technically represents the source code that is executed on your computer and enables the chat.

Furthermore, Userlike stores the chat record. This shall not only spare you the inconvenience of recalling the whole chat history of past chats when you ask for our assistance via live chat but shall also ensure an continuous quality control regarding our live chat. If you do not want to have your chat record stored please contact us and we will delete it immediately. You may find our contact details at the end of this privacy statement.

##### Use of Services

If you decide to make use of our services, we may ask you for further personal data. If you make use of services that are free of charge (e.g. Free Trial or Edition "Free") this is the name of your company or your website address, your first name, surname and username, your email address andyour password. If you want to use our fee-based services (e.g. Edition "Team", "Corporate", "Business", "Custom" or "Flex") you must furthermore provide us with the necessary payment details, depending on the chosen payment method (e.g. credit card details, etc.).

Depending on the individual use of the relevant service we might process further personal data insofar as it is necessary to render our services. This relates for example to the content of chats or chat records that have been conducted and stored by making use of our services and IT infrastructure.

##### Registration on this website

You can register on our website in order to access additional functions offered here. The input data will only be used for the purpose of using the respective site or service for which you have registered. The mandatory information requested during registration must be provided in full. Otherwise, we will reject your registration.

To inform you about important changes such as those within the scope of our site or technical changes, we will use the email address specified during registration.

We will process the data provided during registration only based on your consent per Art. 6 (1)(a) GDPR. You may revoke your consent at any time with future effect. An informal email making this request is sufficient. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.

We will continue to store the data collected during registration for as long as you remain registered on our website. Statutory retention periods remain unaffected.

##### Processing of data (customer and contract data)

We collect, process, and use personal data only insofar as it is necessary to establish, or modify legal relationships with us (master data). This is done based on Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR, which allows the processing of data to fulfill a contract or for measures preliminary to a contract. We collect, process and use your personal data when accessing our website (usage data) only to the extent required to enable you to access our service or to bill you for the same.

Collected customer data shall be deleted after completion of the order or termination of the business relationship. Legal retention periods remain unaffected.

##### Data transmitted when entering into a contract with online shops, retailers, and mail order

We transmit personally identifiable data to third parties only to the extent required to fulfill the terms of your contract, for example, to companies entrusted to deliver goods to your location or banks entrusted to process your payments. 

Your data will not be transmitted for any other purpose unless you have given your express permission to do so. Your data will not be disclosed to third parties for advertising purposes without your express consent.

The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR, which allows the processing of data to fulfill a contract or for measures preliminary to a contract.

##### Transfer of personal data

Userlike will transfer data to third parties only to the extent necessary to render its services. For any other purposes we will transfer personal data to third parties only with your prior and explicit consent. That applies in particular to the transfer of personal data for advertising purposes. Exceptions to this rule apply only in the following cases:

  * If required for investigating the illegal use of the services of Userlike or for legal proceedings, personal data will be transferred to the criminal investigation authorities and, if legally obliged, to injured third parties. We are also legally obliged to give certain public authorities information. These are criminal investigation authorities, public authorities which prosecute administrative offences entailing fines and the German finance authorities.
  * Occasionally we depend on contractually affiliated external companies and external service providers to supply services such as the supply of advertising measures (only if you have given your explicit prior consent), processing payments (credit card etc.), storing your data and customer service. In such cases, information is transferred to these companies or individuals in order to enable them to process this information further. The service providers may only use the data for the purposes stipulated by Userlike and solely in accordance with German data protection laws.
  * In order to further develop our business, we may alter the corporate structure of Userlike e.g. by changing its legal form. We may also form, sell or buy subsidiaries, divisions or parts of the company. In such transactions, customer information together with the part of the company to be transferred will be passed on. Every time personal data are transferred to third parties to the extent prescribed, Userlike will ensure that this is done in accordance with this privacy statement and the relevant data protection laws.

#### 7\. Analytics and advertising

##### Facebook "Custom Audiences" Retargeting

Userlike may use the "Custom Audiences" service of Facebook Inc. (1601 Willow Road, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA, or, if you are based in the EU, Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland ("Facebook")) through a pixel, a piece of JavaScript code incorporated into all our web pages, to provide personalized ads to visitors of our website. 

Facebook stores a cookie on the user’s computer to enable an analysis of the use of our online products and services. If not done manually by the user, the data and cookie are deleted after a predetermined time.

Facebook’s Custom Audiences service also allows us to track user behavior on our website after they have been redirected to the our website by clicking on a Facebook ad. This enables us to measure the effectiveness of Facebook ads for statistical and market research purposes.

The data collected in this way is anonymous to us, i.e. we do not see the personal data of individual users. However, the data is stored and processed by Facebook, which is why we are informing you here. Facebook may link the information to your Facebook account and also use it for its own promotional purposes, in accordance with Facebook’s Data Usage Policy: <https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/>

##### Google Analytics

This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service. It is operated by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.

Google Analytics uses so-called "cookies". These are text files that are stored on your computer and that allow an analysis of the use of the website by you. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there.

Google Analytics cookies are stored based on Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior to optimize both its website and its advertising.

###### IP anonymization

We have activated the IP anonymization feature on this website. Your IP address will be shortened by Google within the European Union or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area prior to transmission to the United States. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address sent to a Google server in the US and shortened there. Google will use this information on behalf of the operator of this website to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity, and to provide other services regarding website activity and Internet usage for the website operator. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with any other data held by Google.

###### Browser plugin

You can prevent these cookies being stored by selecting the appropriate settings in your browser. However, we wish to point out that doing so may mean you will not be able to enjoy the full functionality of this website. You can also prevent the data generated by cookies about your use of the website (incl. your IP address) from being passed to Google, and the processing of these data by Google, by downloading and installing the browser plugin available at the following link: <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en>.

###### Objecting to the collection of data

You can prevent the collection of your data by Google Analytics by clicking on the following link. An opt-out cookie will be set to prevent your data from being collected on future visits to this site: Disable Google Analytics.

For more information about how Google Analytics handles user data, see Google's privacy policy: <https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en>.

###### Outsourced data processing

We have entered into an agreement with Google for the outsourcing of our data processing and fully implement the strict requirements of the German data protection authorities when using Google Analytics.

###### Demographic data collection by Google Analytics

This website uses Google Analytics' demographic features. This allows reports to be generated containing statements about the age, gender, and interests of site visitors. This data comes from interest-based advertising from Google and third-party visitor data. This collected data cannot be attributed to any specific individual person. You can disable this feature at any time by adjusting the ads settings in your Google account or you can forbid the collection of your data by Google Analytics as described in the section "Refusal of data collection".

##### Google AdSense

This website uses Google AdSense, a service for including advertisements from Google Inc. ("Google"). It is operated by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.

Google AdSense uses so-called "cookies", which are text files stored in your computer that enable an analysis of the way you use the website. Google AdSense also uses so-called web beacons (invisible graphics). Through these web beacons, information such as the visitor traffic on these pages can be evaluated.

The information generated by cookies and web beacons relating to your use of this website (including your IP address), and delivery of advertising formats, is transmitted to a Google server in the US and stored there. This information can be passed on from Google to contracting parties of Google. However, Google will not merge your IP address with other data you have stored.

AdSense cookies are stored based on Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior to optimize both its website and its advertising.

You can prevent the installation of cookies by setting your browser software accordingly. Please be aware that in this case, you may not be able to make full use of all the features of this website. By using this website, you agree to the processing of data relating to you and collected by Google as described and for the purposes set out above.

##### Google Analytics Remarketing

Our websites use the features of Google Analytics Remarketing combined with the cross-device capabilities of Google AdWords and DoubleClick. This service is provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.

This feature makes it possible to link target audiences for promotional marketing created with Google Analytics Remarketing to the cross-device capabilities of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick. This allows advertising to be displayed based on your personal interests, identified based on your previous usage and surfing behavior on one device (e.g. your mobile phone), on other devices (such as a tablet or computer).

Once you have given your consent, Google will associate your web and app browsing history with your Google Account for this purpose. That way, any device that signs in to your Google Account can use the same personalized promotional messaging.

To support this feature, Google Analytics collects Google-authenticated IDs of users that are temporarily linked to our Google Analytics data to define and create audiences for cross-device ad promotion.

You can permanently opt out of cross-device remarketing/targeting by turning off personalized advertising in your Google Account; follow this link: https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/.

The aggregation of the data collected in your Google Account data is based solely on your consent, which you may give or withdraw from Google per Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR. For data collection operations not merged into your Google Account (for example, because you do not have a Google Account or have objected to the merge), the collection of data is based on Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing anonymous user behavior for promotional purposes.

For more information and the Google Privacy Policy, go to: <https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/>.

##### Google AdWords und Google Conversion-Tracking

This website uses Google AdWords. AdWords is an online advertising program from Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States ("Google").

As part of Google AdWords, we use so-called conversion tracking. When you click on an ad served by Google, a conversion tracking cookie is set. Cookies are small text files that your internet browser stores on your computer. These cookies expire after 30 days and are not used for personal identification of the user. Should the user visit certain pages of the website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and the website can tell that the user clicked on the ad and proceeded to that page.

Each Google AdWords advertiser has a different cookie. Thus, cookies cannot be tracked using the website of an AdWords advertiser. The information obtained using the conversion cookie is used to create conversion statistics for the AdWords advertisers who have opted for conversion tracking. Customers are told the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a conversion tracking tag page. However, advertisers do not obtain any information that can be used to personally identify users. If you do not want to participate in tracking, you can opt-out of this by easily disabling the Google Conversion Tracking cookie by changing your browser settings. In doing so, you will not be included in the conversion tracking statistics.

Conversion cookies are stored based on Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior to optimize both its website and its advertising.

For more information about Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking, see the Google Privacy Policy: <https://www.google.de/policies/privacy/>.

You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so that you can decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept or reject a cookie. Alternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically accept cookies under certain conditions or to always reject them, or to automatically delete cookies when closing your browser. Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of this website.

##### Doubleclick

Userlike uses Doubleclick, a web analytics service provided by Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway in 94043 Mountain View, USA (hereinafter: Doubleclick).

The legal basis for data processing is Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The legitimate interest consists in an error-free function of the website. Doubleclick has certified itself under the EU-US Privacy Shield Agreement (see <https://www.privacyshield.gov/list>). The data will be deleted as soon as the purpose of their collection has been fulfilled. For more information on the handling of the transferred data, please refer to Doubleclick's privacy policy: <https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/>. You can prevent Doubleclick from collecting and processing your data by disabling script code execution in your browser or by installing a script blocker in your browser (which can be found at [www.noscript.net](http://www.noscript.net/) or [www.ghostery.com](http://www.ghostery.com/), for example).

##### AMP

Userlike uses AMP, a website publishing technology developed by Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway in 94043 Mountain View, USA (hereinafter: AMP) to reduce the loading time of its website, especially on mobile devices, and improve the user experience.

In this context, Userlike uses the Google AMP Client ID API to receive a Client ID through which a website visitor’s page activity on pages with and without AMP can be connected to Google Analytics via a cookie. The legal basis for data processing is Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The website owner's legitimate interest consists in an interest to analyze user behavior in order to optimize website services and advertising.

For more information on the handling of the transferred data, please refer to the section "Google Analytics" and AMP’s data privacy policy: <https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/>.

If the collection of data for Google Analytics is deactivated as described in the section "Google Analytics", no link via AMP Client ID takes place.

Linkedin stores a cookie on the user’s computer to enable an analysis of the use of our online products and services. If not done manually by the user, the data and cookie are deleted after a predetermined time.

If you would like to receive our newsletter, we require a valid email address as well as information that allows us to verify that you are the owner of the specified email address and that you agree to receive this newsletter. No additional data is collected or is only collected on a voluntary basis. We only use this data to send the requested information and do not pass it on to third parties.

We will, therefore, process any data you enter onto the contact form only with your consent per Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR. You can revoke consent to the storage of your data and email address as well as their use for sending the newsletter at any time, e.g. through the "unsubscribe" link in the newsletter.

MailChimp is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield. The Privacy Shield is an agreement between the European Union (EU) and the US to ensure compliance with European privacy standards in the United States.

We use MailChimp to analyze our newsletter campaigns. When you open an email sent by MailChimp, a file included in the email (called a web beacon) connects to MailChimp's servers in the United States. This allows us to determine if a newsletter message has been opened and which links you click on. In addition, technical information is collected (e.g. time of retrieval, IP address, browser type, and operating system). This information cannot be assigned to a specific recipient. It is used exclusively for the statistical analysis of our newsletter campaigns. The results of these analyses can be used to better tailor future newsletters to your interests.

If you do not want your usage of the newsletter to be analyzed by MailChimp, you will have to unsubscribe from the newsletter. For this purpose, we provide a link in every newsletter we send. You can also unsubscribe from the newsletter directly on the website.

Data processing is based on Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR. You may revoke your consent at any time by unsubscribing to the newsletter. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.

The data provided when registering for the newsletter will be used to distribute the newsletter until you cancel your subscription when said data will be deleted from our servers and those of MailChimp. Data we have stored for other purposes (e.g. email addresses for the members area) remains unaffected.
