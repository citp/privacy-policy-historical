The following statement discloses The USENIX Association's information gathering and dissemination
practices.
<p>
The USENIX Association maintains member databases that contain mailing, billing, and member profile
information, as well as a record of each member's product purchases and registrations for conferences.
The information in these databases is used by authorized USENIX staff members to process orders; mail
invoices, purchases, renewal notices, and announcements; and respond to member inquiries. Member
records are maintained as long as an individual is a USENIX member and for three years following a
membership lapse. Purchase and registration databases may be retained for up to three years.
</p><p>
USENIX logs all accesses from your IP address to our Web site, and summary information derived from
these logs may be displayed on the Web
</p><p>
Personal information is stored in a relational database and standard security methods are used to protect it.
We require full confirmation of identity before releasing information back to the user for update over the
Web.
</p><p>
Commercial information (such as credit card numbers) is obtained using our secure Web server and may be
stored on our machines. When the data are stored, we use public key encryption on the sensitive data and
require our staff to supply a private key to decrypt it. When passing such information internally over the
Internet, we use our secure server.
</p><p>
</p><h3>Electronic Communication</h3> The USENIX Association does not rent or sell email addresses. USENIX may use
email addresses to contact members to answer member questions or to acknowledge the receipt of
membership applications and other orders, to send membership renewal notices, and to send occasional announcements
about USENIX events to those members who have not opted out of receiving such announcements. These
announcements are short straightforward messages that contain pointers to online resources where
members can explore the information more fully.
<p>
</p><h3>Postal Mail</h3> USENIX uses the postal addresses of its members to mail invoices, products, and announcements
from USENIX. The names and mailing addresses of members who have not opted out (see below) may be
rented to outside organizations to send mailing packages that have been carefully screened by authorized
USENIX staff for their suitability. USENIX member names and mailing addresses are never sold.
<p>
</p><h3>Opt-Out</h3> Our site gives you the opportunity to opt out from either receiving email communications or from
having your name and address made available to anyone other than the USENIX Association.  When registering for
a conference, you have the option not to be on the Attendee list.
<p>
</p><h3>Change/Modify</h3> The USENIX site gives users the opportunity to change and modify information previously
provided by using the online form found at <a href="http://www.usenix.org/membership/membership.html">
www.usenix.org/membership/membership.html</a>, or by phone:

Note: Information is always updated
whenever a new conference registration occurs or upon renewal of a membership.
<p>
</p><h3>Links</h3>This site contains links to other sites. The USENIX Association is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.
