<p>
This Privacy Policy describes how uSell.com ("we" or "us") gathers and uses
personal information submitted on our website www.uSell.com (uSell.com). It also describes the
choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access
and update this information.</p>

<p>uSell.com searches the web for the best offers to trade in or recycle your old electronics; then
uSell.com refers you to a reseller or recycler's website to sell or recycle your product. uSell.com
will share your personal information with these carefully selected resellers and recyclers when
you agree to submit for a quote. This means we do not take your credit card information and we
do not take your money. Registration on uSell.com is voluntary, if you do decide to register, we
will not share your personal information until you agree to submit to a quote. You do get access
to certain features if you register, but membership is not necessary to find trade-in and recycling
offers.</p>

<p>uSell.com has been awarded TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy policy and
practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with <a href="http://www.truste.com/privacy-program-requirements/index.html" target="_blank">TRUSTe's program requirements</a>
including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your
personal information. The TRUSTe program covers the website www.uSell.com. TRUSTe's
mission, as an independent third party, is to accelerate online trust among consumers and
organizations globally through its leading privacy trustmark and innovative trust solutions. If you
have questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact us <a href="http://support.usell.com">here</a>. If
you are not satisfied with our response you can contact TRUSTe <a href="http://watchdog.truste.com/pvr.php?page=complaint" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>

<p>If you create a member account at the uSell.com website, you will be asked to provide certain
personally identifiable information ("PII") such as your email address. Once you register you can
visit your profile on the uSell.com website at any time to add, edit or remove PII, such as your
first and last name. If you decide to provide PII, you are telling us that this information is both
true and accurate, and that you are authorized to provide it to us.</p>

<p>If you join uSell.com using a third-party social network account, such as Facebook Connect,
we will collect information shared by the third-party network according to that third-party's
privacy policy. In addition to the above personal information, we collect standard information
about uSell.com users such as IP addresses, browser type, operating system, what you searched
for, referring and exit pages, the dates and times of visits, and other site usage behavior ("Site
Visitation Data"). Site Visitation Data is used to administer the site and provide general statistics
regarding the use of the uSell.com website. We may also use Site Visitation Data to display
advertising or send targeted email marketing messages you may find interesting and to suppress
advertising that might not interest you.</p>

<p>To help improve our site and services, we may collect certain technical information from your
browser software, screen resolution and the website that referred you to us.</p>

<h2>Keeping in Touch</h2>

<p>When you choose to register with us, uSell.com logs you in automatically using your email
address or Facebook profile (if you registered using Facebook Connect). This saves you the trouble of having to create and remember a log in identifier and it allows us to email you a new
password should you forget your old one. If you do register with us, uSell.com will save your
information and recognize you regardless of where you log in from.</p>

<p>uSell.com gives you the option of receiving emails from us. You can opt out of receiving these
emails at any time by following the instructions located in the "Control of Personal Information"
section below. Also, every email we send has an opt-out URL, so that you can unsubscribe
whenever you want.</p>

<h2>Sharing information with friends and in user forums</h2>

<p>The uSell.com website allows you to share certain information with friends that you select.
Please bear in mind that uSell.com cannot control what your friends do with the information you
share with them, so you should only share with friends you trust. Once displayed on publicly
viewable web pages, information that you share can be collected and used by others. To request
removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, please contact us at
privacy@uSell.com.<script type="text/javascript">

/* ]]> */
</script> In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in
which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if you participate in a user forum on the uSell.com website, your comments and
your uSell.com username will be displayed to all uSell.com users on the forum. uSell.com is not
responsible for what any user or third party may do with information that you choose to share.</p>

<p>We may also provide a feature allowing you to invite a friend to join uSell.com. If you
provide a friend's email address to us for this reason, we will use that email address only for
the purpose of sending a onetime invitation to your friend. Your friend may contact us at

<h2>Use of personal information</h2>

<p>We will treat your personal information as confidential, and we will not share your personal
information with third parties without your permission, except in the limited circumstances
described below.</p>

<p>If you accept a referral from uSell.com to one of our partner sites, we may provide PII to the
partner site to save you having to re-enter that information. When you select a partner site to sell
your phone to, you must opt in to allow your PII to be submitted to that partner site, and you
agree to be bound by their privacy policy as regards use of your PII.</p>

<p>We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with
our business activities such as fulfilling your request for a free shipping kit, purchasing your
phone, or sending confirmation or other emails. These companies are authorized to use your
personal information only <i>as necessary to provide</i> these services to us.</p>

<p>We may disclose your personal information when we reasonably believe that it is required by a
law or legal process and to protect and defend the rights and interests of uSell.com, its affiliates,
suppliers, or users. In the event uSell.com goes through a business transition, such as a merger,
being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information
will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.</p>

<p>We may use and disclose your aggregated usage information with others, in a form that does not
identify any individual, to allow uSell.com and our advertisers to present targeted advertising
to you. We may disclose to third parties, including advertisers and potential business partners,
aggregated statistics that we develop from your usage habits, preferences, and history. For
example, we may disclose generalized information about usage habits based on aggregated
statistics developed from your site usage behavior and search history. This statistical information
will not identify any individual.</p>

<h2>Control of personal information</h2>

<p>You can confirm, change, delete or update personal information you have provided to us
by logging into your account and going to the Account Settings page, or by contacting us at
<a href="mailto: support@usell.com">support@usell.com<script type="text/javascript">

</script></a>.</p>

<p>You can change your email and contact preferences at any time by logging into your account
and going to the Account Setting page and amending your email notification choices. If
you wish, you can also opt-out of receiving promotional emails, by sending a request to

/* ]]> */
</script></a>. When you opt-out of promotional communications from us, you may
still receive service messages (such as an order confirmation) and legally mandated notices.</p>

<p>Please note that, even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account,
copies of that information may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent it has been shared with
others, it was otherwise distributed pursuant to your privacy settings, or it was copied or stored
by other users. We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed
to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our
legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

<h2>Security of personal information</h2>

<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted

storage is one hundred percent secure and we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Please
contact us, if you have any questions about security on our site.</p>

<h2>Protection of children's privacy</h2>

<p>We do not knowingly collect any PII from people under the age of 13. If we become aware that a
child under 13 is attempting to submit this information, we will inform the minor that he or she is
ineligible to do so. We will then remove this information from our records.</p>

<h2>Use of cookies and tracking technology</h2>

<p>When you visit our site we may store information about your web session and assign you one
or more cookies. Your browser will store these cookies on your computer in a small text file,
and if you return to the site the cookie may be read. For example, when you decide to log in as a
uSell.com member, we store encrypted information in your browser so you don't have to log in

<p>We may also use web beacons, clear gif technology, or action tags as mechanisms to collect
aggregate site visitation data by tracking how users navigate to and through our website. We may
also use this technology to track the delivery of HTML email messages. Data collected through
this mechanism is not linked to personal information.</p>

<p>Permanent cookie files remain on your computer's hard drive until you delete them manually
using your browser or operating system software. You can enable your browser to refuse
cookies, but doing so may disable access to some services and tools that we offer.</p>

<p>uSell.com works with advertising partners to place advertising on our site. Our third party
advertising partners often use a cookie or third party web beacon to track when a click becomes a
sale. No PII is ever sent to these advertising partners.</p>

<p>The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers is
not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our
partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers use session ID cookies to make it
easier for you to navigate our site.</p>

<p>We use Java script to gather email address entered into the site. When you enter an email
address onto the site, we may send periodical reminder emails to that address about items left in
a cart. You may opt-out of these emails by following the unsubscribe link in an email.</p>
