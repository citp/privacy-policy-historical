# USENIX - USENIX/SAGE Membership - Privacy Statement

**Our Privacy Statement**

The following statement discloses The USENIX Association's information gathering and dissemination practices. 

The USENIX Association maintains member databases that contain mailing, billing, and member profile information, as well as a record of each member's product purchases and registrations for conferences. The information in these databases is used by authorized USENIX staff members to process orders; mail invoices, purchases, renewal notices, and announcements; and respond to member inquiries. Member records are maintained as long as an individual is a USENIX member and for three years following a membership lapse. Purchase and registration databases may be retained for up to three years. 

USENIX logs all accesses from your IP address to our Web site, and summary information derived from these logs may be displayed on the Web 

Personal information is stored in a relational database and standard security methods are used to protect it. We require full confirmation of identity before releasing information back to the user for update over the Web. 

Commercial information (such as credit card numbers) is obtained using our secure Web server and may be stored on our machines. When the data are stored, we use public key encryption on the sensitive data and require our staff to supply a private key to decrypt it. When passing such information internally over the Internet, we use our secure server. 

### Electronic Communication

The USENIX Association does not rent or sell email addresses. USENIX may use email addresses to contact members to answer member questions or to acknowledge the receipt of membership applications and other orders, to send membership renewal notices, and to send occasional announcements about USENIX events to those members who have not opted out of receiving such announcements. These announcements are short straightforward messages that contain pointers to online resources where members can explore the information more fully. 

### Postal Mail

USENIX uses the postal addresses of its members to mail invoices, products, and announcements from USENIX. The names and mailing addresses of members who have not opted out (see below) may be rented to outside organizations to send mailing packages that have been carefully screened by authorized USENIX staff for their suitability. USENIX member names and mailing addresses are never sold. 

### Opt-Out
