		<h1>Privacy Policy for WWW.USG.EDU</h1>
	<p>This Privacy Policy sets forth the University System of Georgia's ("USG")
  policy with respect to the gathering and dissemination of information we obtain
  from you on the web site for the University System of Georgia located
  at <a href="/">www.usg.edu</a> ("Site").</p>
<p>USG is the operator of this Site, although software, hosting and other functions
  may be provided by third parties ("Service Providers"). This Privacy Policy
  describes the type of information USG and its Service Providers collect from
  visitors to this Site, what we do with that information, and how visitors can
  update and control the use of information provided on this Site. This policy
  does not necessarily describe information collection policies on other sites,
  such as separate sites operated by our Service Providers that we do not control.
  Many of the resources linked from this Web site are not maintained by the USG.
  The USG cannot monitor all linked resources, only those pages which fall directly
  within the USG world-wide web structure. The USG is in no way responsible for
  the privacy practices or the content of these linked resources and the statements,
  views, and opinions expressed therein are neither endorsed by nor do they necessarily
  reflect the opinion of the USG.</p>
<p>This policy may be changed from time to time and without further notice. Your
  continued use of the Site after any such changes constitutes your acceptance
  of the new terms. If you do not agree to abide by these new terms or any future
  terms, please do not use the Site. This site is not directed to children under
  13 years of age, and children under 13 years of age shall not use this Site
  to submit any personal information about themselves.</p>
<h3>Information We Gather </h3>
<p>When you visit the Site, we may collect certain routing information, including,
  but not limited to, the Internet Protocol address of your originating Internet
  Service Provider, and information provided by "cookies" stored on your hard
  drive. We may also collect aggregate information about the use of the Site,
  including, but not limited to, which pages are most frequently visited, how
  many visitors we receive daily, and how long visitors stay on each page. We
  may disclose and publish aggregate information on an aggregate basis to any
  party through any means, but such aggregate information will not disclose any
  personal information. Any information collected through this Site may also
  be used in aggregate by system administrators in the administration of the
  Site. You may be required to provide certain personal information in order
  to access various features and information on the Site. Such information may
  include, among other things, your name, address, and phone number. If you do
  not want to provide such information, you may choose not to access those features
  of the Site. Any personal information that you choose to provide through the
  Site will be protected in accordance with the provisions of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3>Cookies </h3>
<p>Cookies are small pieces of data that may be stored by a Web browser. Cookies
  are often used to remember information about preferences and pages you have
  visited. For example, when you visit some sites on the Web you might see a "Welcome
  Back" message. The first time you visited the site a cookie may have been
  set on your computer; when you return, the cookie is read again. You can refuse
  to accept cookies, can disable cookies, and remove cookies from your hard drive.
  However, if you do not accept cookies from the Site, you may lose access to
  the Site or experience decreased performance of the Site.</p>
<h3>Security and Accuracy of Confidential Information </h3>
<p>The USG does its best to ensure that the personal information obtained from
  you is accurate. You may review the information saved or submitted via the
  Site at any time up to the point when it is purged from the flat file or database.
  In the event that there is an error in your personal information, we will correct
  the information on your request.</p>
<p>While we strive to protect your personal information by encryption and other
  means, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of the information you transmit
  to us, and if you choose to use the Site, you do so at your own risk.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that the information disclosed by you on our Site in certain
  forums -- for example, information, including personal information, that you
  may provide to others on bulletin boards, through blogs or in chat rooms that
  may be available on the Site -- can be collected and used by visitors to the
  Site.</p>
<h3>Sharing of Information </h3>
<p>The USG is committed to maintaining the privacy and accuracy of your personal
  information. We do not actively share personal information gathered from the
  Site. However, some information collected from the Site may be subject to the
  Georgia Open Records Act. This means that while we do not actively share information,
  in some cases we may be compelled by law to release information gathered from
  the Site. Georgia public universities also comply with the Family Educational
  Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which prohibits the release of education records
  without student permission. For more details on FERPA, currently enrolled students
  should see their institution's catalog.</p>
<h3>Questions </h3>
<p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or you believe that your personal
  information has been released without your consent or if you wish to correct
  information held by the USG, <a href="/about/contact/">please contact us</a>.</p>
