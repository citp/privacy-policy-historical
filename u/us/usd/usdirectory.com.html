<p>Publisher recognizes the importance of privacy and has attempted to conform this Privacy Policy with applicable industry standards and practices existing at the time of its posting.  We welcome your feedback.  This Privacy Policy provides you information on the following areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>The information Publisher collects, and whether this includes personally identifiable information;</li>
<li>What Publisher does with your information, and how  Publisher shares your information;</li> 
<li>Security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information under Publisher's control;</li> 
<li>Choice and Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information; and</li>   
<li>Changes to the Privacy Policy.</li></ol>

<p><strong>1. Information Publisher collects, and whether this includes personally identifiable information</strong></p>
<p>Personally identifiable information is collected if it is necessary to provide the Publisher Services.  For example, when you visit Publisher websites, performance and usage information (such as search term, time of day, browser type, default language setting, IP address, an anonymous unique ID, and a code which identifies the distribution source of the Software) will be transmitted to Publisher for Services evaluation.  This information does not personally identify you.  If a search query is generated as a result of a misspelled search term, we also receive the misspelled search term. Importantly, all information collected from a search query is recorded on a non-personally identifiable basis and is kept strictly anonymous. In addition, all search activity information is evaluated only on an aggregated basis (except in response to a customer service inquiry or legal process).  When you sign up for a Publisher account or other Service that requires registration, we ask you for personal information such as your name, email address and an account password.  The information voluntarily provided by you during the Publisher registration and the submission process may also include or naturally entail other demographic information such as gender, age, occupation, household income, zip code and country.  We also request credit card or other payment account information which we maintain in encrypted form on secure servers.</p>
 
<p>We may combine the information you submit under your account with information from other Publisher  services or third parties in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our Services.  Our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website.  These server logs may include information such as your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.</p>
  
<p>Cookies are small files that contain information that Crawler uses to track trends and patterns of how people search.  We send one or more cookies to your computer that uniquely identify your browser.  We use cookies to improve the quality of our Service.  Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.  However, some Publisher features may not function properly if your receipt of cookies is disabled.  When you send email or other communication to Publisher, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our Services.</p>
 
<p>We collect the full Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the Web page from which you came to Publisher, your IP address, which may include a domain name, the date and time for each page you view; the name of and information about any advertisement or other link that brought you to Publisher.</p>
 
<p>We also collect the name of and information about any advertisement or other link that brought you to Publisher.  If you e-mail Publisher, we may store copies of such e-mail or similar communications between you and Publisher.  This can result in the collection of your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information you may have in your e-mail text, addresses, or other fields, as well as the collection of the your IP address, the Internet or other routing of your communication, and the date and time of your communication.</p>  
<p>All transmissions between you and Publisher, including e-mails, URLs, cookie identification numbers, usage paths, and any personally identifiable information they might contain, pass through many third party machines, operating systems, programs, browsers, Web servers, networks, routers, Ethernet switches, ISPs, proxy servers, intranets, the public telephone systems, or other devices, any of which may create activity logs containing such transmissions, and many of which Publisher cannot control.</p>

<p><strong>2. What Publisher does with the information it collects and how it Publisher shares the information</strong></p>
<p>We use your information solely for providing Services, and therefore, as a natural part of providing the Services, Publisher will share your information with its employees, contractors, or agents.  Publisher also may contact you by e-mail to respond to your customer service inquiries.  We do not disclose your e-mail address to business partners or to anyone other than employees, contractors and  agents working for or on behalf of Publisher, except as required by law.  If you have given us your e-mail address but wish to unsubscribe at any time, please see our section regarding changing your information for instructions on how to do so.</p>

<p>We may share personal information with persons outside of Publisher if we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable <a href="http://www.usdirectory.com/Terms.aspx" target="_blank">USdirectory.com Terms of Offer</a>, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of Publisher , its users or the public as required or permitted by law. We disclose any information we possess in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal requirements, and such information might be used by the receiving party to determine your identity.  We do not rent or sell your personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>If Publisher becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice if such a transaction results in your information being subject to a different privacy policy.</p> 
<p>We use cookies for such functions as verifying that you are a Publisher user and enabling the fulfillment of Services.  We use IP addresses to diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our website.  Your IP address also is used by Publisher to gather broad demographic information, such as your general geographic location and internet service provider.  IP addresses are further used to help determine the number of Publisher users.  This demographic information may also be used by Publisher to analyze aggregate usage behavior.</p>
<p>We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf, such as technical support services.  To perform those functions, it may be necessary for them to obtain access to Publisher databases and servers, which may contain personally identifying information about users.  We will not provide your account information to any third party except as described in this Privacy Policy or with your consent.  These parties are obliged to use the information according to our instructions and they are bound to this Privacy Policy and must apply appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</p>
  
<p><strong>3. Security measures used to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information under Publisher's control</strong></p>
<p>Publisher uses commercially reasonable computer security safeguards to protect its databases and servers against risks of loss, unauthorized access, destruction, misuse, modification, or inadvertent or improper disclosure of data.  These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.  We restrict access to personal information to Publisher employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our Services.  Security risks, however, cannot be completely eliminated and Publisher therefore cannot guarantee complete security.</p>
<p>If you send us an email, you should know that email is not necessarily secure against interception. Therefore, if your communication will include sensitive information like your bank account, charge card, or social security number, and you prefer not to transmit it electronically, please contact us by postal mail or telephone rather than email.</p> 

<p><strong>4. Choice and Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information</strong></p>

<p>You can decline to submit personal information to any of our Services, in which case Publisher may not be able to provide the Service to you.  If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy, we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes.  If your personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if you no longer desire the Services, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally identifiable information.  This can usually be done emailing our customer support through the Publisher site.</p>
 
<p><strong>5. Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong></p> 
<p>This Privacy Policy may change from time to time.  We expect most such changes to be minor.  You are responsible for periodically reviewing this Privacy Policy for any applicable changes.</p>
