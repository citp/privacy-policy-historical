# USseek.com - Privacy Policy

Whether you've come to USseek.com merely to search or as a business owner considering a listing in our directory, we want you to know that we take your privacy seriously. 

USseek.com may ask you to supply basic information, such as your city, state, or zip code in order to provide local results, or for tracking purposes (so we can see where our visitors are coming from). With your permission, some of this data may be used to help us better provide the information or services you are seeking. However, we will _never_ sell, lease or trade your data to anyone at any time. 

When submitting a listing to our directory, we will ask you for slightly more information, including your name, and a method of contacting you (usually an email address, sometimes an email address or phone number), but, again, this data will be used only to contact you about issues pertaining to your listing in USseek.com. As above, your contact information will never be sold, leased or traded. 

From time to time you may click on one of the links in our directory, which will lead you to a third-party website. Some of these third-party sites may ask you for additional data in order to provide accurate information, or confirm that they offer the service you are seeking. While we make every effort to vet our partners, affiliates, and directory members to ensure that they are as diligent about protecting your privacy as we are, we cannot, and do not, take responsibility for what they may do with information you provide to them, and strongly suggest that you read their privacy policies before providing any sensitive information. 

We understand that there is inherent risk in doing business over the internet, and we pledge to reduce that risk as much as possible where our own site is concerned. We appreciate your trust in us, and invite you to contact us if you have any questions or concerns.
