	Welcome to </font><a href="http://www.usta.com/">
	<font face="Arial" size="2">www.usta.com</font></a><font face="Arial" size="2">. 
	This site (the "Site") is owned by the United States Tennis Association (the 
	"USTA"). This Privacy Policy is designed to tell you about our practices 
	regarding collection, use and disclosure of information that we may collect 
	from and about you. Please be sure to read this entire Privacy Policy before 
	using or submitting information to this Site. This Site is intended for use 
	by residents of the United States. <p></p>
	<strong>
	</strong></font><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Your Consent</strong><b><br>
	</b><br>
	By using this Site, you agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy. 
	Whenever you submit information via this Site, you consent to the 
	collection, use and disclosure of that information in accordance with this 
	Privacy Policy, the Terms of Service and any specific provisions of this 
	Site that may be presented at the time information is collected.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>About Children</strong><br>
	<br>
	The Site is a general audience site.&nbsp; We do not knowingly collect any 
	personal information from children under the age of thirteen on the Site.&nbsp; 
	If in the future, we collect personally identifiable information from 
	children, we will do so in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy 
	Protection Act of 1998 (15 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.).&nbsp; The Internet offers 
	children wonderful educational and entertainment resources.&nbsp; Your 
	guidance and involvement are essential to help ensure that children have a 
	safe and rewarding online experience.&nbsp; We encourage you to visit the 
	Direct Marketing Association's Web site (</font><a href="http://www.the-dma.org/"><font face="Arial" size="2">www.the-dma.org</font></a><font face="Arial" size="2">)

	to learn more about parental control tools.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Active Information Collection</strong><b><br>
	</b><br>
	Like many Web sites, this Site actively collects information from its 
	visitors both by asking them specific questions and by permitting them to 
	communicate directly with us via e-mail, feedback forms, chat rooms and so 
	forth. Some of the information that you submit may be personally 
	identifiable information (that is, information that can be uniquely 
	identified with you, such as your full name, address, e-mail address, phone 
	number and so on).<br>
	<br>
	Some areas of this Site may require you to submit information in order for 
	you to benefit from the specified features (such as newsletter 
	subscriptions, tips/pointers, order processing and so forth) or to 
	participate in a particular activity (such as sweepstakes or other 
	promotions and so forth). You will be informed at each information 
	collection point what information is required and what information is 
	optional.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Passive Information Collection</strong><br>
	<br>
	As you navigate through this Site and/or receive emails in connection with 
	this Site, certain information may be passively collected (that is, gathered 
	without your actively providing the information) using various technologies 
	and means, including, without limitation, those described below:<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Cookies</strong><b><br>
	</b><br>
	As with many Websites, the Site uses standard technology called "cookies," 
	which are small data files that are transferred to your computer when you 
	allow your browser to accept cookies.&nbsp; Cookies automatically identify 
	your Web browser to the Site whenever you visit the Site, and make using the 
	Site easier for you by saving your passwords, purchases, and preferences.&nbsp; 
	By tracking how and when you use the Site, cookies help us determine which 
	areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the 
	Site are based on data obtained from cookies.&nbsp;<br>
	<br>
	Accepting cookies allows you, among other things, to personalize your 
	experience on the Site.&nbsp; Cookies may also allow the Site to present to 
	you advertising which may be of interest to you. If you do not want 
	information collected through the use of cookies, you generally can opt out 
	of providing this information by turning the cookies off in your browser; 
	however, some areas of the Site may not provide you with a personalized 
	experience if you have disabled the use of cookies.&nbsp;<br>
	<br>
	<strong>IP Addresses and Automatic Information</strong><br>
	<br>
	We may collect IP addresses and/or automatic information for purposes of 
	system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers 
	and sponsors.&nbsp; An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned 
	to your computer whenever you access the Internet. Our computers identify 
	your computer by its IP address.&nbsp; When you request Web pages from the 
	Site, our computers log your IP address.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
	<br>
	Automatic information is information collected by our computers when you 
	request Web pages from the Site.&nbsp; Automatic information may include 
	such information as the page served, the time, the source of the request, 
	the type of browser making the request, the preceding page view and other 
	such information.&nbsp; When analyzed, this data helps us analyze how 
	visitors arrive at the Site, what type of content is most popular, what type 
	of visitors in the aggregate are interested in particular kinds of content 
	and advertising, and the like.&nbsp;</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2">
