Cookies for improving service by measuring traffic

We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, in order to find out how visitors interact with Russell Investments so we can improve it. Information is collected anonymously and website trends are reported without identifying individual visitors.

__utmb and __utmc | The B and C cookies work together to calculate how long a visit takes.

__utmb takes a timestamp of the exact moment in time when a visitor enters a site, while __utmc takes a timestamp of the exact moment in time when a visitor leaves a site.

__utmc has no way of knowing when a user closes their browser or leaves a website, so it waits 30 minutes for another pageview to happen, and if it doesn't, it expires.

The LinkedIn Insight Tag

This tag enables the collection of data regarding members’ visits to your website, including the URL, referrer, IP address, device and browser characteristics (User Agent), and timestamp. This data is encrypted, the IP addresses are truncated, and members’ direct identifiers are removed within seven days in order to make the data pseudonymous.

LinkedIn does not share the personal data with the website owner, it only provides aggregated reports about the website audience and ad performance. LinkedIn also provides retargeting for website visitors, enabling the website owner to show personalized ads off its website by using this data, but without identifying the member.
