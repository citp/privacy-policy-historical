USA Ultimate respects and protects the privacy of our users. We encourage parents and kids to use and enjoy our Web site. Our privacy policy as described below is spelled out with the intention of educating parents and kids about how to safeguard their privacy when surfing on the web. We urge parents to discuss with their children the importance of protecting the confidentiality of personally identifiable information.
