If you identify yourself by sending us an e-mail containing personal information, then the information collected will be solely used to respond to your message.

The information collected is for statistical purposes and for the purposes of providing demographics to test owners. UsabilityHub Pty Ltd may use software programs to create summary statistics, which are used for such purposes as assessing the number of visitors to the different sections of our site, what information is of most and least interest, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas. Company logos and names may be used for promotional purposes.

For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, UsabilityHub Pty Ltd uses software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.

UsabilityHub Pty Ltd will not obtain personally-identifying information about you when you visit our site, unless you choose to provide such information to us, nor will such information be sold or otherwise transferred to unaffiliated third parties without the approval of the user at the time of collection.

### Confidentiality

UsabilityHub, its employees, agents, and subcontractors, will keep confidential all data and customer information including test content, imagery and test results. Information in your account may be seen by UsabilityHub employees only for the purposes of providing support. All test content is private and confidential, and will not be shared with any third-parties or published in any form without prior written approval.

Your tests are not visible to other members of UsabilityHub except upon request in the form of a response order. Ordering responses from UsabilityHub makes your test temporarily available to a sub-set of our users until the order has been fulfilled or cancelled. UsabilityHub testers agree to keep confidential all information and imagery viewed on UsabilityHub tests.

All test results are private and cannot be viewed publicly or by other UsabilityHub members unless actively shared by you or invited members of your account.

If you require custom NDAs in order to use our services please contact support@usabilityhub.com.

### Payment information

Credit card processing is handled by [Stripe](https://stripe.com/). To enable Stripe to provide secure payment facilities it will typically acquire information which may include the Cardholder's name, credit card number (with the expiry date) and billing address. Stripe uses the information to obtain authorization of the transaction from the Issuing bank of the credit card to process the payment. Some details from the transaction (including name, email, and delivery address) are made available to UsabilityHub. Credit card numbers and CVC numbers are handled exclusively by Stripe in accordance with PCI Data Security Standards (PCI DSS) and are not made available to UsabilityHub. Please see [Stripe's Security Documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/security/stripe) for more details about their payment system and security measures.
