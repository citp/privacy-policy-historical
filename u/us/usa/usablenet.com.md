# Customer Support - Privacy Policy - UsableNet

## USABLENET INC. PRIVACY AGREEMENT

The information you enter in UsableNet, Inc. website will be known to only by you and UsableNet. UsableNet will not release your personal data to anyone else without your consent. 

## USAGE OF INFORMATION GATHERED BY USABLENET

UsableNet collects data from your IP address to help diagnose your web pages or website. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information about our audience which we use to improve UsableNet products and services, and deliver statistical information such as the Web Usability Index (WUI). UsableNet uses cookies to track users when they come to our Web site. This allows us to learn how many unique visitors we have, aid in analyzing navigation paths through our site, grant discounts to visitors who elect to take part special promotions, and to maintain login information during a subscriber's session. Cookie tracking identifies visitors with a unique number; personal information such as name and address are only correlated with cookie information that allows us to manage subscriber login sessions. Other companies which eventually place advertising on our site or that are part of the UsableNet Inc. affiliate program, also have the ability to assign their cookies to you in a process that UsableNet Inc. does not control. However, cookies cannot be used to identify individuals, only machines, so these advertisers will not know who you are, and UsableNet Inc. will not disclose this information. 

## FREE SERVICE USERS

When using our free services, we have a form for users to enter their URL, email address and other site-related information. The URL is always required because our tool needs this information in order to run a test on the website. Due to the nature of our other services an email address is also required (for example to contact a user about a server problem). Personal data is never released to any third party. 

## SUBSCRIPTION USERS

The UsableNet, Inc. registration form requires users requesting a product or service to provide their contact information (such as name, email address, postal address etc.). We use this information to process the order, to email information on the company (such as a promotional mailing on new services), and to contact the visitor when necessary. We do not collect the visitor's financial information (such as credit card numbers) via our website. Such information is directly communicated through a secure connection from clients' browsers to the site of the institution processing the credit card transaction. 

## FOR ALL USERS

Whether you are a free user or subscription user, you can be assured that if you provide information to UsableNet Inc., no individual data will passed on to a third party. UsableNet Inc. will divulge information only if requested by state court and federal laws. On occasion, UsableNet Inc. conducts online surveys that ask visitors for contact information (like their email address) and demographic information. These surveys are conducted to determine better ways to support our customers. Survey results provide us information that enables us to better tailor our content to user needs and to help our advertisers better understand the aggregate demographics of our audience. No individual personal data will ever be released from these surveys. Data may be used in aggregate form to learn more about our customers' needs. UsableNet Inc. may present information to our advertisers in the form of summative statistics compiling among all of our visitors' answers to survey questions as well as collective on-site behavior. This is to help our advertisers tailor the content of ads to the interests of our customers. At no time is individual data shared with anyone. The UsableNet site contains links to other sites and is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. For this we advice you to read the privacy statements of linked websites, as their Privacy Policy may differ from that of UsableNet.
