**Usablenet Privacy Policy**

**Last updated: November 2012**

Usablenet respects your privacy and takes the protection of personal information very seriously. This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) describes how we protect your privacy in connection with your use of the Usablenet website currently located at [http://www.usablenet.com](http://www.usablenet.com/) (the “Site”). 

BY USING THE SITE, YOU CONSENT TO THE PRIVACY PRACTICES DESCRIBED IN THIS POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SITE. 

**Types of Information Collected by Usablenet**

Usablenet collects anonymous information and, depending on how you choose to use our Site, may collect personal information. Anonymous information is information that may be collected by web browsers and servers, but that cannot be traced to a specific personal identity (for example, browser type, language preference, referring site, or the date and time of visitor requests). Usablenet may use this anonymous information to collect and publish aggregate statistics, including statistics about the behavior of its website visitors. Usablenet may store this information on its servers or elsewhere for an indefinite period of time. Personal information is information that can be used to establish the identity of an individual user (for example, your name, address or phone number). Other than as described below, Usablenet does not disclose personal information.

**Cookies.**  A “cookie” is a small data file that a website stores on your computer when you visit, and which your browser will provide to the website each time you return. Usablenet uses cookies to collect, store and sometimes track information for development of statistical information, and to improve user experience by tracking Site preferences. Usablenet does not collect any personal information through its use of cookies. You can set your browser to refuse cookies before using the Site, or to be notified as soon as cookies are sent. However, if you decide not to accept Usablenet’s cookies, certain features of the Site may not function optimally.

**IP Address.**  An Internet Protocol (“IP”) address allows web servers to identify your computer by a unique string of numbers assigned to your computer. Usablenet collects IP addresses but does not use the information to identify its visitors, other than to collect demographic information, help diagnose problems with our server, administer the Site, or as otherwise described in this Policy.

**Correspondence.**  You may visit the Site without giving us your personal information. However, you may choose to provide your personal information to Usablenet. The amount and type of information Usablenet gathers will depend on the nature of your interaction with Usablenet. For example, you may provide personal information to ask about our services, report a problem, sign up for notifications of updates to our blog site or apply for a job. The type of personal information you provide may include name, phone number, address, e-mail address and information from your resume such ask educational background and work history. Usablenet will use this information to respond to your requests or inquiries, or otherwise fulfill the purpose of your interaction with Usablenet. Usablenet may also use the contact information you provide to communicate with you from time to time about our services and products, third party services and products that we believe may be of interest to you, or requests for feedback. 

**Use and Disclosure of Personal Information.**

Usablenet does not sell your personal information to third-parties. Access to personal information collected by Usablenet is limited to employees, contractors and agents of Usablenet or Usablenet’s affiliates who are bound by non-disclosure obligations. By using the Site and by providing us your personal information, you consent to the disclosure and transfer of personal information to such employees, contractors, agents and affiliates, who may be located anywhere in the world. Usablenet may use and disclose anonymous and personal information in the following circumstances, in addition to circumstances described elsewhere in this Policy:

  * When you have consented to such use or disclosure;

To ensure that your personal information is protected, our third party vendors may not use or disclose your personal information for any other purpose;
  * As part of any merger, acquisition, or other business transfer. For example, if a company acquires part of our business, and your information is part of the acquired assets, then your information will be transferred to the acquiring company;
  * When we believe in good faith that disclosure is appropriate to comply with law, regulation or legal process, such as a subpoena or court order; and
