# UsableNet - Privacy Policy

## UsableNet Inc. Privacy Agreement

The information that you submit on the UsableNet, Inc. website will be for internal use only. UsableNet will not release your personal data to any third parties without your consent.

## Usage of Information gathered by UsableNet

UsableNet collects data from your IP address to diagnose your web pages or website. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information about our audience which we use to improve UsableNet products and services, and deliver statistical information such as the Web Usability Index (WUI). UsableNet uses sometimes cookies to track users when they come to the website. This allows us to learn how many unique visitors we have, aid in analyzing navigation paths through our site, grant discounts to visitors who elect to take part in special promotions, and to maintain login information during a subscriber's session. Cookie tracking identifies visitors with a unique number; personal information such as name and address are only correlated with cookie information that allows us to manage subscriber login sessions. Other companies which eventually place advertising on our site or participate in the UsableNet Inc. affiliate program, also have the ability to assign their cookies to you in a process that UsableNet Inc. does not control. However, cookies cannot be used to identify individuals, only machines, so these advertisers will not know who you are, and UsableNet Inc. will not disclose this information.

## Free Service Users

When using our free services, we have a form for users to enter their URL, e-mail address and other site-related information. The URL is always required because our tool needs this information in order to run a test on the website. Due to the nature of our other services, an e-mail address is also required (for example to contact a user about a server problem). Personal data is never released to any third party.

## Subscription Users

The UsableNet, Inc. registration form requires users requesting a product or service to provide their contact information (such as name, e-mail address, postal address etc.). We use this information to process the order, to e-mail information on the company (such as a promotional mailing on new services), and to contact the visitor when necessary. We do not collect the visitor's financial information (such as credit card numbers) via our website. Such information is directly communicated through a secure connection from the clients' browsers to the site of the organization processing the credit card transaction.

## For all Users

Whether you are a free user or subscription user, you can be assured that if you provide information to UsableNet Inc., no individual data will be passed on to a third party. UsableNet Inc. will divulge information only if requested by state court and federal laws. On occasion, UsableNet Inc. conducts online surveys that ask visitors for contact information (like their e-mail address) and demographic information. These surveys are conducted to determine better ways to support our customers. Survey results provide us information that enables us to better tailor our content to user needs and to help our advertisers better understand the aggregate demographics of our audience. No individual personal data will ever be released from these surveys. Data may be used in aggregate form to learn more about our customers' needs. UsableNet Inc. may present information to our advertisers in the form of summary statistics compiling among all of our visitors' answers to survey questions as well as collective on-site behavior. This is to help our advertisers tailor the content of ads to the interests of our customers. At no time is individual data shared with anyone. The UsableNet site contains links to other sites and is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. For this we advice you to read the privacy statements of linked websites, as their Privacy Policy may differ from that of UsableNet.

## Security

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of your personal information. Access to computer data and files at UsableNet, Inc. are secured by firewalls and password coding to prevent unauthorized access. UsableNet utilizes industry standard SSL encryption when accepting your credit card information during our online checkout process. SSL encryption is a method by which information transmitted across the internet is encoded to defeat theft by anyone who should intercept the data before it reaches its destination. Our security and privacy policies are periodically updated and enhanced as necessary, and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our customers.

All credit cards processing supported by UsableNet's site is implemented in a way that credit card numbers and data are not stored in UsableNet's database, but are directly passed (in a secure encrypted way) to a bank service that processes them. Therefore in the unlikely situation that third parties can get access to UsableNet's database, this information won't be available at all. For more details please read the [Safe Transactions](https://web.archive.org/web/20051213202852id_/http%3A//www.usablenet.com/customer_support/safe_transaction.html) page. 

## E-mail Management

UsableNet keeps e-mail addresses in its own private database and does not use any other internet resources to collect them. When you receive an e-mail from UsableNet you will find an URL that lets you to unsubscribe to the news service. By doing so, your e-mail address will be marked in our database as "REMOVED", so that you will not receive any other unsolicited e-mails from any UsableNet services. If you want to re-subscribe your e-mail address, you need to send an e-mail to UsableNet customer support ([support@usablenet.com](mailto:support@usablenet.com)), asking to reactivate your e-mail address. If you have used more than one e-mail address to operate UsableNet's website or tools, you'll need to mark each of these addresses in order to avoid receiving news messages.
