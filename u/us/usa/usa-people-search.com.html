			The records that you see when you run searches on USA People Search are all public records.  If you are surprised to see yourself in our database, this is most likely 
			due to having property records, marriage records, or some other type of public record that was created at some time in your life.  We don't create 
			any of the records in our database, we simply aggregate public records from thousands of sources.  We are basically like Google, but instead of 
			searching for web sites you are searching for people.

			USA People search takes every precaution to protect our users' information.  When users submit sensitive information via the website, your 
			information is protected both online and offline.
			<br><br>
			When our registration form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number or contact information), that information is encrypted and 
			protected with the best encryption software in the industry.  Our servers are behind firewalls as well.
			<br><br>
			While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user information offline.  All 
			of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a 
			specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they 
			leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information. Finally, the servers that we store 
			personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment.
