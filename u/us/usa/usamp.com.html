Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, we do not trade, share, rent, sell or give away information concerning you to third parties.

                <p>United Sample will only share data and/or information with its clients in an aggregated form or format, which does not permit the client to identify individual respondents. We sometimes may share non-personal information with third parties about our user base, but that information does not include any personally identifiable information.</p>
                <p>We may disclose your Personal Information or otherwise use such information to communicate with you if required or permitted to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (i) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process or any governmental request; (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of United Sample or its affiliated companies and clients; (iii) enforce the Website terms of service or any applicable agreements; or (iv) protect the personal safety or interests of United Sample’s employees, other users of the Website, or members of the public in urgent circumstances. We may also disclose any of your personal information to law enforcement or other appropriate third parties in connection with criminal investigations, investigation of fraud, infringement of intellectual property rights, or other suspected illegal activities, or as otherwise may be required by applicable law, or, as we deem necessary in our sole discretion, in order to protect the legitimate legal and business interests of United Sample.</p>

Prior to performing services, United Sample requires Subcontractors to agree in writing to protect and maintain the security and integrity of the Personal Information disclosed by United Sample and to use the Personal Information only in accordance with the specific purpose for which such Personal Information was disclosed by United Sample.</p>

                <h3>Change of control</h3>
                <p>In the event that another company acquires all or substantially all of the assets related to the Website, or if we experience some other change of control event such as merger, insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership, we reserve the right to include any or all Personal Information among the assets transferred to the acquiring company. United Sample will require the surviving entity in the case of a merger, or the acquiring entity in the case of an acquisition or sale, to agree in writing to protect and maintain the security and integrity of the transferred Personal Information in accordance with the applicable laws. We do not guarantee that any entity receiving such information in connection with any of these transactions will comply with all the terms of this policy.</p>

                <h3>Data security &amp; integrity</h3>
                <p>United Sample is committed to protecting the security and integrity of all Personal Information collected by, or disclosed to, United Sample and takes appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of such Personal Information. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. We also restrict access to Personal Information to our employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the Personal Information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.</p>

                <h3>Accessing and updating personal information</h3>
                <p>We make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your Personal Information and to correct this data if it is inaccurate. Individuals may access their Personal Information in order to review, correct, or delete any Personal Information by accessing their individual membership account and following the instructions contained therein. We request individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed or corrected before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.</p>

                <h3>Opting-out of panels</h3>
                <p>If a panel member desires to end his or her membership with an United Sample panel, such panel member may terminate his or her membership by (a) following the instructions set forth in their membership account, or (b) sending an email request to support@usamp.com. Upon opting out of panel membership, United Sample will deactivate the applicable membership account and the individual will not receive any further survey invitations; although the individual may continue to receive some previously prepared survey invitations for a few days following the termination of membership. United Sample will retain the Personal Information of a terminating member for an indefinite period of time; however, United Sample will continue to protect such Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

                <h3>Compliance</h3>

                <p>We strive to conform our privacy practices, policies and/or procedures with applicable laws, regulations and rules and the industry codes, standards and regulations of various market and opinion research professional associations and/or organisations, including without limitation the ICC/ESOMAR International Code on Market and Social Research and the Code of Standards and Ethics for Survey Research of the Council of American Survey Research Organizations ("CASRO"), with whom United Sample is a member.</p>

                <h3>DIGITAL FINGERPRINTING</h3>
                <p>Digital fingerprinting technologies assign a unique identifier to a user's computer to identify and track the computer.</p>
                <p>United Sample will not use digital fingerprinting to collect Personal Information, or track the online activities, of the user of a computer; and will not disrupt or interfere with the use or control of a computer or alter, modify or change the settings or functionality of a computer. United Sample will use digital fingerprinting to assist United Sample's clients in ensuring the integrity of survey results. In furtherance of United Sample's efforts to assist its clients in protecting and ensuring the integrity of survey results, United Sample (a) may link or associate your unique identifier to you and any of your Personal Information; (b) may share your unique identifier with United Sample's clients and with other sample or panel providers; and (c) may receive or obtain a unique identifier linked to you from a related or unrelated third party. Any unique identifier received or obtained by United Sample and linked to a specific individual will be protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy. United Sample shall use digital fingerprinting in a professional and ethical manner and in accordance with (a) United Sample's privacy policy, (b) any statements and/or disclosures made by United Sample to respondents, and (c) applicable laws and industry codes.</p>

                <h3>Children's privacy protection</h3>
                <p>United Sample complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and all other applicable laws and regulations concerning children and the Internet.</p>
                <p><strong>Children under the age of 13</strong></p>
                <p>Because the Website and surveys are not directed to children under the age of 13, we do not provide memberships to persons under age 13.

                <p><strong>Information for Parents/Guardians</strong></p>
                <p>If you are a parent or guardian who has discovered that your child has submitted his or her personal information without your permission or consent, United Sample will take reasonable steps to remove that information from the its database at your request. To request removal of your child’s information, please send us an e-mail at support@usamp.com and be sure to include in your message the same user name, password, and e-mail address that your child submitted.</p>
