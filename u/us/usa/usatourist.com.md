USATourist.com is committed to protecting your privacy. We do not automatically collect personally identifiable information such as your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address. Our server collects non-identifiable information about all site accesses such as the country of origination, the Internet Service Provider, the type of browser and the type of computer used. We use that information to study our audience and better serve our readers. 

In some cases, you may voluntarily provide personal information in response to a reader survey, a request for information or a posting on an electronic bulletin board. We do not collect such information or use it unless we notify you of our intended use beforehand. As an example, we may ask for information such as your e-mail address in conjunction with subscription to a newsletter. We will clearly tell you about our intended use of that information when we request it. 

USATourist sometimes works with other advertisers, and we normally offer useful links to other Internet resources. We can not know the privacy policies of all these other sites. We encourage you to question the privacy policies and the intended usage of any personal information requested from you.
