## Our Privacy Promise to You

## Your Personal Information and Identity

There are precautions you can take to help protect your personal information and your identity online.

### Don't Become a Victim of Identity Theft

Identity theft occurs when someone uses your name, Social Security number, credit card number or other personal information to purchase a product or service.

#### Signs You Could be a Victim

  * You're not getting your bills or other mail.
  * You see suspicious charges on your accounts.
  * You get a credit card you didn't apply for.
  * You're unexpectedly denied credit.
  * You get information about services and products you didn't buy.



### Protect Yourself Online

  *  **Keep a clean machine.** Having the latest security software, web browser and operating system are the best defenses against viruses, malware and other online threats for all your devices. Turn on automatic software updates if that's an available option.
  *  **Protect your personal information.** Make passwords long and strong, and create different passwords for each of your accounts. If you write down your passwords to remember them, make sure they are stored in a secure location away from your devices.
  *  **Connect with care.** Delete or mark as junk any suspicious links in email, tweets, posts and online advertising. If you don't know and trust the source, delete it. Limit the type of business you conduct in public Wi-Fi hotspots.
  *  **Be web wise.** Be wary of communications that ask you to act immediately or that ask you for personal information. Protect your valuable work, music, photos and other digital information by making an electronic copy and safely storing it.
  *  **Be a good online citizen.** Post only about others as you would have them post about you. Help the authorities fight cyber crime by reporting stolen finances or identities and other cybercrime to the Internet Crime Complaint Center at [www.ic3.gov](http://www.ic3.gov/ "Opens New Window"), and to your local law enforcement or state attorney general as appropriate.



You can find more information about these and other online safety habits from **[STOP. THINK. CONNECT. ™](http://www.stopthinkconnect.org/ "Opens New Window"),** the global cybersecurity awareness campaign launched in partnership with the U.S. government to help all digital citizens stay safer and more secure online.

### Use Social Media Wisely

Social media can connect you with family and friends, colleagues and businesses in an online community. However, just as in real-world communities, you should be careful what you share and how you share it.

#### Use Privacy Controls

Privacy controls allow you to restrict who can see your profile and posts. Options change frequently and you should check and update your settings often.

#### Watch What You Post

When posting, keep in mind that even a deleted post may have already been copied and the content may still be in the provider's system even if you can no longer see it. You also shouldn't post significant information about family members, such as their birthdays, ages or even their names.

#### Don't Reveal Too Much on the First Date

Personal information such as where you live, work or go to school could be used against you. Travel plans can give an indication that your home may be unoccupied. Identity thieves will read through your profile history which can paint a detailed picture of who you are.

#### How and Where to Post Photos

Photos taken with newer cameras and Smartphones can include your location embedded in the image. This can show criminals where you are even if you don't mention it in the post. The background of the photo may also give away information.

#### Phishing

Social media has seen an increase in phishing as people migrate away from email. Beware of links from friends or business users whose accounts you have not verified. These links could infect your computer with malicious software and put your information and online activity at risk.

### Practice Public Safety

When using a credit or debit card:

  *  **Only carry the identification, credit and debit cards that you need.**
  *  **See if the card reader appears to be damaged or modified.** If so, don't use it. Thieves sometimes use a tactic called skimming where they alter a machine to get a copy of your card information.
  *  **Be aware of people and surroundings.** Don't approach an ATM if you don't feel secure about its location or people around it. Protect your privacy by shielding the keypad with your hand or body while entering your PIN.
  *  **Stash your cash.** After completing your transaction, secure your card and cash immediately, before leaving the area. Count your cash later, in the safety of your home or locked car. Your card is like cash, so keep it in a safe place.
  *  **Keep your card in sight.** When completing a purchase in person, make sure you can see the cashier who takes your card whenever possible. If they leave the area and you feel uncomfortable, ask to speak to a manager. Make sure you check your statement and charges regularly, especially if you're worried about suspicious behavior.



#### Tell us about identity theft, lost cards   
or suspicious activity.
