#### Rights Under The Privacy Act Of 1974 

The Privacy Act of 1974 (Privacy Act) (5 U.S.C. § 552a) prohibits the disclosure of information about individuals that the federal government maintains in a system of records without their consent. The FCC is required to provide notice of its systems of records by publication in the Federal Register. The FCC published a systems of record notification (SORN) for the Lifeline Program that is designated as [FCC/WCB-1](https://transition.fcc.gov/omd/privacyact/documents/records/FCC-WCB-1.pdf). The National Lifeline Accountability Database (NLAD) and the Lifeline National Eligibility Verifier (National Verifier) are part of the FCC's Lifeline program systems of record (FCC/WCB-1) and the data is protected under the Privacy Act. USAC adheres to the Privacy Act requirements with respect to all information that it collects, maintains, uses, or disseminates in NLAD and the National Verifier.

If you participate in the Lifeline program, you will be asked to provide additional information to verify your eligibility to receive federal Lifeline benefits. This information includes first name, last name, address, last four digits of social security number (SSN) and date of birth. USAC will share this information that you provide with a third-party verification service to verify your identity and may share your data with other state and federal agencies to verify your eligibility to receive Lifeline support. In addition, your information may also be used for the purposes described in the SORN.
