				Collection and Use</b></font><br>
				USA ePay collects personally identifiable information when you 
				register for an USA ePay account, and when you use certain USA 
				ePay products and services. USA ePay may also receive personally 
				identifiable information from its resellers and other business 
				partners.<br>
				<br>
				When you register with USA ePay, we ask for your contact 
				information (such as your name, street address and email 
				address), as well as certain information pertaining to your 
				business, along with billing information such as a bank account 
				and/or credit card number.<br>
				<br>
				In the course of processing a payment transaction, we typically 
				receive information related to the transaction from the merchant 
				or a financial institution. This normally includes information 
				about the payment that a consumer has furnished to the merchant 
				or financial institution in the course of placing the order. We 
				do not acquire any information directly from consumers through 
				the www.usaepay.com Web site. We do not sell your personal 
				information to third parties.<br>
				<br>
				The personally identifiable information we acquire in processing 
				payment transactions varies according to the nature of the 
				transaction and the way in which merchants or financial 
				institutions are using our payment services. It may include, for 
				example, the amount of the transaction, the consumer's name, 
				credit card number and expiration date or checking account 
				number, billing address, and shipping address.<br>
				<br>
				USA ePay uses the information collected to fulfill your requests 
				for products and/or services, to process payment transactions, 
				to facilitate billing, and otherwise deliver the payment gateway 
				services. Personally identifiable consumer information is only 
				used to process payment transactions and is never used for any 
				other purpose.<br>
				<br>
				USA ePay does not offer services or sell products to children. 
				USA ePay does not request or knowingly collect personally 
				identifiable contact information from anyone under the age of 
				13.<br>
				<br>
				Information Sharing and Disclosure<br>
				Protecting personally identifiable information about merchants 
				and consumers is an important part of our business. We share and 
				disclose such information only as described below.<br>
				<br>
				USA ePay will only send personally identifiable information 
				about you to other companies or people when: 1) we have your 
				consent to share the information; 2) we need to share your 
				information to provide the product or service you have 
				requested; 3) we need to send the information to companies who 
				work on behalf of USA ePay to provide a product or service to 
				you (unless we tell you differently these companies do not have 
				any right to use the personally identifiable information we 
				provide them beyond what is necessary to assist us).<br>
				<br>
				Personally identifiable consumer information is shared with 
				third parties (such as banks and credit card processors) to the 
				extent necessary for USA ePay to deliver payment processing 
				services.<br>
				<br>
				We also may release personally identifiable information when we 
				believe release is appropriate to comply with law, such as a 
				subpoena, or similar legal process; enforce or 
				apply our Merchant Agreement and other agreements; or protect 
				the rights, property, or safety of USA ePay, our users, or 
				others. This includes exchanging information with other 
				companies and organizations for fraud protection and risk 
				reduction.<br>
				<br>
				In the unlikely event that USA ePay is acquired, merchant 
				account information may be one of the transferred assets. <br>
