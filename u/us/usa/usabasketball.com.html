On the Site, you may enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise share your opinions, subscribe to one of our email newsletters or shop for products at the Store.  Through these services, the Site collects various forms of personally identifiable information. When subscribing to one of our email newsletters, we collect the email address you supply to us.  When you shop at our Store, the information we collect includes: your first and last name; mailing address; phone number; e-mail address; and credit card information. We may on occasion combine the information that you provide with information that we obtain from public sources or reputable third parties.
<br><br>
We also may collect non-personally identifiable information regarding your visit to the Site, including browser information, page views, content and advertisements you have viewed and/or clicked on, and other technical information, including Internet Protocol (IP) address and Internet Service Provider (ISP) information. We may combine this and other non-personally identifiable information with the personally identifiable information that we have collected, including to customize and/or enhance your experience on the Site.
<br><br>
<strong>Use of Cookies.  </strong>We use "cookie" technology (including browser and flash cookies) to customize and enhance your online experience on the Site. Cookies are pieces of information transferred to your hard drive when you visit the Site that automatically identify your browser to our server whenever you interact with the Site. Such technology is a common feature of many websites and is necessary in order for certain features of the Site to function properly or in order to provide an online service to you (e.g., to recognize you or maintain your shopping cart when you visit the Store). We do not collect personally identifiable information through the use of cookies; however, once you furnish the Site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. You may customize the browser settings of your computer to notify you when a browser cookie is sent or to refuse browser cookies altogether. Please check your browser for instructions on how to make these adjustments.
<br><br>
<strong>Third Party Cookies. </strong> You also should be aware that we cannot generally control the use of cookies (or the resulting use of information obtained from cookies) by third parties that host or provide data, content and services for, or advertise on, the Site.  The Site uses reputable third party vendors, such as DoubleClick, to serve most of the advertisements that you see on the pages of our site. If you would like to know more about the information gathering practices and "opt-out" procedures of DoubleClick, please <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/index.aspx" target="_new">click here</a>.  If you do not want any third parties to use cookies to collect information about your activities on the Site, you may customize your browser settings to reject “third party” cookies.
<br><br>
<strong>3. How your information is used</strong>
<br><br>
We may use your information to provide you with services, products and information you have requested on the Site (e.g., e-mail newsletters, Store orders); to respond to your inquiries (e.g., e-mailed questions); to offer you other products, services, programs or information that we think may be of interest to you; and for any other purpose for which you provided the information. We also may use your information to prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities; enforce our Terms of Use; and to improve the design and/or content of the Site or our other services. In addition, we may use your information and/or supplement your information with information we obtain from other sources to analyze usage of the Site and to customize and/or enhance your experience on the Site.
<br><br>
<strong>4. With whom your information may be shared</strong>
<br><br>
As indicated above, we may disclose personally identifiable information to those within the USA Basketball Family. From time to time, we may also share personally identifiable information with third parties we have engaged to perform certain services in connection with the operation of certain aspects of the Site, including to analyze usage of the Site and to improve the design and/or content of the Site or our other services. These third party service providers are required to use this information only in a manner consistent with this Policy (e.g., not using the information for purposes unrelated to the services they are providing to us).
<br><br>
Members of the USA Basketball Family have several sponsors and other business partners that can offer valuable products and services to our users. Except as indicated otherwise on the Site, we will not disclose your e-mail address to these partners if you have indicated that you do not wish to receive information, special offers or promotions from third parties via e-mail. If you do not want your personally identifiable information shared with these partners, you may make such a request by sending us an e-mail at <a href="mailto:usab-fanrelations@nba.com">usab-fanrelations@nba.com</a> or writing to us at 645 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10022, Attn: USA Basketball Online Opt Out. From time to time, we may share or provide non-personally identifiable information to these partners so that they may better understand the users of our Site. Your personally identifiable information also may be shared if we, or one of our business units, is acquired by, sold to, or merged with another entity. In this case, you will be advised of any change in the applicable privacy policy.
<br><br>
Our third party partners and service providers may also set their own (third party) cookies on the Site.  If you do not want third parties to use cookies to collect information about your activities on the Site, you may customize your browser settings to reject “third party” cookies.
<br><br>
While we are careful to select only reputable third parties as partners and service providers, and we take appropriate measures to ensure that they only use your personally identifiable information in a manner consistent with this Policy, we do not control the actions of these third parties and cannot be responsible for their actions. All third parties associated with the Site with whom we share information have independent privacy and data collection practices. We also encourage you to read the privacy policy of every third party web site that you visit via a link on the Site.
<br><br>
Finally, we may disclose personally identifiable information in our discretion to cooperate with law enforcement or other government officials; if asked to disclose information by subpoena, court order or other legal process; or where we believe it is appropriate to prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and to enforce our Terms of Use.
