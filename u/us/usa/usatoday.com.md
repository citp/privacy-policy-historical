Effective Date: July 12, 2005

The following Privacy Policy governs USATODAY.com's online information collection practices.  Specifically, it outlines the types of information that USATODAY.com gathers about you while you are using the USATODAY.com website (the "Service"), and the ways in which USATODAY.com uses and doesn't use this information.  This Privacy Policy, including the children's privacy statement, does not apply to any information you may provide to us or that we may collect offline and/or through other means (for example, at a live event, via telephone, or through the mail).  In addition, this Privacy Policy does not apply to any activities (online or otherwise) of the 

USA TODAY print newspaper.

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.  By visiting the USATODAY.com website, you agree that your use of our Service, and any dispute over privacy, is governed by this Privacy Policy and our [Terms of Service](http://www.usatoday.com/marketing/tos.htm).  Because the Web is an evolving medium, we may need to change our Privacy Policy at some point in the future, in which case we'll post the changes to this Privacy Policy on this website and update the Effective Date of the policy to reflect the date of the changes.  By continuing to use the USATODAY.com website after we post any such changes, you accept the Privacy Policy as modified.

**Your California Privacy Rights**

California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law,  permits our customers who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, information about the personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year.  If applicable, this information would include a list of the categories of personal information that was shared and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared information in the immediately preceding calendar year.  If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to:

**What Information is Collected About Visitors? '**

The information that USATODAY.com collects about you while you are using the Service falls into two general categories: 

1\. _Information You Provide to Us_.

USATODAY.com may collect and store information, personal or otherwise, that you voluntarily supply either while on the USATODAY.com website or in responding via email in connection with a feature provided on the USATODAY.com website.  Some examples of this type of information include demographic information that you electronically submit when you sign up for access to certain features on the Service, information (such as your name or email address) that you electronically submit when you register for surveys, sweepstakes or contests on the USATODAY.com website, information that you post on message boards on the USATODAY.com website, and information contained in search requests or questions that you submit to the USATODAY.com website.  If you decline to supply or provide USATODAY.com with certain information while using the Service, you may not be able to use or participate in some or all of the features offered through the Service.

2\. _Information that is Automatically Collected._

USATODAY.com also collects and stores information that is generated automatically as you navigate through the USATODAY.com website.  For example, to enhance your experience on the USATODAY.com website, USATODAY.com uses a standard feature found in browser software called a "cookie."  Cookies are small files that your web browser places on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. By showing how and when visitors use the USATODAY.com site, cookies help us track user trends and patterns.  They also prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences on certain areas of the USATODAY.com site where you have entered preference information before.  USATODAY.com also uses web beacons (also known as "single-pixel GIFs") to access cookies and to count users who visit the USATODAY.com site or open USATODAY.com's HTML-formatted email messages.  Another example of information that USATODAY.com automatically collects as you navigate the USATODAY.com site is information about your computer's connection to the Internet.  This information allows us, among other things, to improve the delivery of our web pages to you and to measure traffic on the USATODAY.com site.

In addition, third party advertisers or third party ad servers that place and present advertising on the Service also may collect information from you via cookies, web beacons, clear .gifs or similar technologies.  These third party advertisers and ad servers may use the information they collect to help present their advertisements, to help measure and research the advertisements' effectiveness, or for other uses. The use and collection of your information by these third party advertisers and ad servers is governed by the relevant third party's privacy policy and is not covered by our privacy policy.  Indeed, the privacy policy of these third party advertisers and ad servers may be different from our privacy policy.  If you want more information about the privacy policies of these third party advertisers and ad servers or want more information on how to opt-out of the cookies that some advertisers and ad servers may use, click _[here](http://www.usatoday.com/marketing/advertiser-list.htm)_.

**How is this Information Used?**

USATODAY.com uses the information it collects from you while you are using the Service in a variety of ways, including using the information to customize features and advertising that appear on the USATODAY.com website.  We also may provide your information to third parties, such as service providers, contractors, and advertisers, for a variety of purposes.  For example, we may provide our advertisers with information about you and other visitors that will enable our advertisers to better target ads to specific types of visitors. 

USATODAY.com reserves the right to use and to disclose to third parties all of the information that USATODAY.com collects online about you and other visitors in any way and for any purpose, with one important exception.  USATODAY.com will not use the information that it collects online from you while you are using the Service, nor will USATODAY.com authorize third parties to use such information, to mail or email promotional offers directly to you unless you have specifically informed USATODAY.com that you would like to receive promotional offers from USATODAY.com and/or from third parties.  If you choose to receive these promotional offers, then your information may be used for direct mail or email marketing.  You may view or update your preference to receive these promotional offers by visiting _[registration.usatoday.com](http://registration.usatoday.com/)_.

Please also keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily make your personal information available for viewing by third parties online – for example on message boards, through email or web logs, or in chat areas – that information can be seen, collected and used by others besides USATODAY.com.  USATODAY.com cannot be responsible for any unauthorized third party use of such information.

The USATODAY.com website includes links to other websites and provides access to products and services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we do not control.  When you access another website or purchase third party products or services through the Service, use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting or the provider of such products or services. 

We also make some content, products and services available through our Service through cooperative relationships with third party providers, where the brands of our provider partner appear on the Service in connection with such content, products and/or services.  We may share with our provider partner any information you provide, or that is collected, in the course of visiting any pages that are made available in cooperation with our provider partner. In some cases, the provider partner may collect information from you directly; in which cases the privacy policy of the provider partner may apply to the provider partner's use of your information.  The privacy policy of our provider partners may differ from ours.  If you have any questions regarding the privacy policy of one of our provider partners, you should contact the provider partner directly for more information.  In addition, certain affiliated 

USA

TODAY divisions, such as the 

USA TODAY print newspaper, provide online services that are separate from our Service and may be subject to privacy policies that are different from ours.  If you have any question about the privacy policy that applies to the online service you are using, you should click on the relevant link on the page of the service that you are using.

USATODAY.com is an affiliate of the CareerBuilder online careers service.  Through our cooperative relationship with CareerBuilder, we are able to provide you with access to the CareerBuilder products and services through a co-branded CareerBuilder site.  When you provide information through the co-branded CareerBuilder site, CareerBuilder may share your information with us and we may use that information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.

Be aware that USATODAY.com may occasionally release information about visitors when release is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce our [Terms of Service](http://www.usatoday.com/marketing/tos.htm) agreement, or to protect the rights, property or safety of visitors to our site, the public, or USATODAY.com.

Please also note that as our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets.  In the unlikely event that USATODAY.com, some or all of our assets, or our site is acquired by another company, information about our visitors may be among the transferred assets.
