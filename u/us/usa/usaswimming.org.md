While we encourage children to engage in our interactive website, we also wish to educate parents and kids about issues of privacy when visiting our site.

As a result, we are committed to full compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"). We collect from children only that information which is necessary for participation. In addition, we have provided parents with the ability to review the type of personal information currently collected about their children, to have that information deleted, and to request that no further personal information be collected by USA Swimming.

USA Swimming respects and protects the privacy of our users. We encourage parents and kids to use and enjoy our Web site. Our privacy policy as described below is spelled out with the intention of educating parents and kids about how to safeguard their privacy when surfing on the web. We urge parents to discuss with their children the importance of protecting the confidentiality of personally identifiable information.
