<h1><strong><u>Usablenet Privacy Policy&nbsp;</u></strong><br>
<strong>Last updated: February 2016</strong></h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Usablenet respects your privacy and takes the protection of personal information very seriously. This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) describes the information we collect and how we protect your privacy in connection with your use of the Usablenet website currently located at http://www.usablenet.com (the “Site”).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>BY USING THE SITE, YOU CONSENT TO THE PRIVACY PRACTICES DESCRIBED IN THIS POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SITE.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What Personal Information Do We Collect?</strong></p>

<p>Personal information is information that can be used to establish the identity of an individual user. You may visit the Site without giving us your personal information. However, you may choose to provide your personal information to Usablenet. The amount and type of information Usablenet gathers will depend on the nature of your interaction with the Site. For example, you may provide personal information to ask about our services, post a comment, report a problem, sign up for notifications of updates to our blog site or apply for a job. The type of personal information you provide may include name, phone number, mailing address, e-mail address and information from your resume such as educational background and work history. Usablenet may store this personal information on its servers or elsewhere for an indefinite period of time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How Do We Use Your Personal Information?</strong></p>

<p>Usablenet may use personal information you provide to respond to your requests or inquiries, or otherwise fulfill the purpose of your interaction with Usablenet. Usablenet may also use the contact information you provide to communicate with you from time to time about our services and products, third party services and products that we believe may be of interest to you, or requests for feedback.</p>

<p>Usablenet uses a third party online commenting system that allows visitors to post comments on the Site. In order to post a comment you will need to enter your e-mail address. Your comments and e-mail address may be shared with the third party online commenting system, and their use and disclosure of such information is governed by the commenting system’s privacy policy.</p>

<p>Please note that Usablenet is not responsible for the information you volunteer about yourself in the discussions in our forums, blogs, or other publicly accessible interaction. We discourage users from posting personally identifiable information in this fashion, and any personally identifiable information you post to these areas is not covered by this Policy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What Anonymous Information Do We Collect and How Do We Use Your Anonymous Information?</strong></p>

<p>Anonymous information is information that may be collected by web browsers and servers, but that cannot be traced to a specific personal identity (for example, browser type, IP address, operating system, language preference, referring site, or the date and time of visitor requests). Usablenet uses cookies, such as Google Analytics, to collect, store and sometimes track anonymous information for development of statistical information, and to improve user experience by tracking Site preferences. Usablenet may also use anonymous information to collect and publish aggregate statistics, including statistics about the behavior of Site visitors. Usablenet may also use cookies to track the effectiveness of e-mail marketing campaigns. Usablenet may store anonymous information on its servers or elsewhere for an indefinite period of time.</p>

<p>A “cookie” is a small data file that a website stores on your computer when you visit, and which your browser will provide to the website each time you return. Usablenet does not collect any personal information through its use of cookies. You can set your browser to refuse cookies before using the Site, or to be notified as soon as cookies are sent. However, if you decide not to accept Usablenet’s cookies, certain features of the Site may not function optimally.</p>

<p>An Internet Protocol (“IP”) address allows web servers to identify your computer by a unique string of numbers assigned to your computer. Usablenet collects IP addresses but does not use the information to identify its visitors, other than to collect demographic information, help diagnose problems with our server, administer the Site, or as otherwise described in this Policy.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Is Your Personal or Anonymous Information Shared? </strong></p>

<p>Usablenet does not sell your personal information to third-parties. Access to personal information collected by Usablenet is limited to employees, contractors and agents of Usablenet or Usablenet’s affiliates who are bound by non-disclosure obligations. By using the Site and by providing us your personal information, you consent to the disclosure and transfer of personal information to such employees, contractors, agents and affiliates, who may be located anywhere in the world. Usablenet may use and disclose your anonymous and personal information in the following circumstances, in addition to circumstances described elsewhere in this Policy:</p>

<ul>
	<li>When you have consented to such use or disclosure;</li>
	<li>With third party vendors or internally in the course of operating our business. For example, we may hire a third party vendor to analyze trends among our visitors. To ensure that your personal information is protected, our third party vendors may not use or disclose your personal information for any other purpose;</li>
	<li>As part of any merger, acquisition, or other business transfer. For example, if a company acquires part of our business, and your personal or anonymous information is part of the acquired assets, then such information will be transferred to the acquiring company;</li>
	<li>When we believe in good faith that disclosure is appropriate to comply with law, regulation or legal process, such as a subpoena or court order; and</li>
	<li>To enforce or protect our rights, property or safety, or the safety of others in an emergency situation.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Compliance With Laws</strong></p>

<p>Usablenet is committed to complying with applicable law and regulation. If permitted by applicable law of the jurisdiction in which you reside, you have the right to request access to, and correction or deletion of, your personal information controlled by Usablenet, if any. You can do this by contacting us via the email or mailing address listed below.</p>

<p>We are also dedicated to complying with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). The Site is not intended for use by those under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not continue to use this Site or provide personal information of any kind whatsoever. If you are a parent who believes that your child has provided us with personal information, you can contact us via the e-mail or mailing address listed below. We will promptly delete information relating to a child under the age of 13.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>California Residents</strong></p>

<p>California Business &amp; Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how we respond to “Do Not Track” browser settings.&nbsp; We do not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed.&nbsp; We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created.</p>

<p>Users of the Site that are California residents may request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request please contact us via the e-mail or mailing address listed below.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Data Security</strong></p>

<p>We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration and disclosure. All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers behind firewalls.</p>

<p>Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our Site. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any&nbsp;privacy&nbsp;settings or security measures contained on the Site.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>International Transfer</strong></p>

<p>If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that you are transferring information and permitting the transfer of information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. and the use and disclosure of information about you, including personal information, as described in this Policy. If you would like to request modification or deletion of your personal information, please contact us via the email or mailing address listed in below this Policy.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>External Links</strong></p>

<p>If any part of the Site links you to other websites, including links to social media sites, those external websites do not operate under this Policy. We recommend that you examine the privacy statements posted on those other websites to understand their procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing personal information.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Changes to Policy; Contact Information</strong></p>

<p>Usablenet reserves the right to change this Policy at any time, in its sole discretion, by posting the updated Policy on this page. Your continued use of the Site following the posting of the updated Policy constitutes your acceptance of such changes.</p>

<p>If at any time, you wish to update your information or would rather not receive communication from us, please let us know by contacting us at the email or mailing address listed below.</p>

<p>If you have any comments or questions about this Policy, please contact us by <a href="mailto:contact@usablenet.com">email</a> or by mail at Usablenet Inc., 142 West 57th Street, 7th Floor, New York, NY 10019.</p>
