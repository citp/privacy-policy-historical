******What's the purpose of this site?  
**  
This site is designed to provide current and accurate information on how to make health-related information Web sites and other user interfaces more usable, accessible, and useful. The site also links to a variety of quality Web sites and resources on usability, accessibility, and related topics that exist in the field. (See our Linking Policy.)

  
  
**********Why is the National Cancer Institute providing this resource?  
**  
Clear and effective online communication to patients, health professionals and researchers is a critical element in the overall communications strategy of the [National Cancer Institute](http://cancer.gov/) (NCI), the federal government's principal agency for cancer research. Because NCI designs and manages a significant number of cancer-related information Web sites, this site was developed to specifically assist NCI Web managers, designers, and authors improve their overall communications and design efforts. However, since the general principles of good design and usability are applicable to anyone who works with information Web sites, we decided to make the site available to other federal agencies and to the general public.

  


**Who manages this site? **

Usability.gov is managed by the Communication Technologies Branch (CTB) of the [National Cancer Institute's](http://cancer.gov/) (NCI's) Office of Communications. The NCI is a component of the [National Institutes of Health](http://www.nih.gov/), the focal point for the nation's biomedical research.

**********  
  
************Who is this site designed for?**

Anyone interested in creating Web sites and other user interfaces that are responsive, easy-to-use, and accessible. Other user interfaces include software applications, personal digital assistants (PDAs) and other mobile technologies, or any device the user can operate in some way or another.

  
  
**********W hat's on this site? **

**********What other communications activities does NCI support? **

NCI has identified cancer communications as a priority. A primary goal is to increase knowledge about, tools for, access to, and use of cancer communications by the public, consumers, patients, survivors, and health professionals — with a special focus on diverse populations — to accelerate reductions in the U.S. cancer burden. 

Usability.gov is one of many communications activities at NCI:

  * [Extraordinary Opportunities in Cancer Communications](http://dccps.nci.nih.gov/eocc/)

  * [Plans & Priorities for Cancer Research: Cancer Communications 2002](http://plan2002.cancer.gov/scpcomms.htm)   
http://plan2002.cancer.gov/scpcomms.htm 
  * [Health Communications and Informatics Research](http://dccps.nci.nih.gov/hcirb)

**Does Usability.gov have a linking policy? **

Usability.gov uses the following guidelines for linking to non-NCI Web sites. Web sites and pages that Usability.gov links to must provide information that 

  * Relates to the mission of Usability.gov. and complements and enhances the information on Usability.gov; 
  * Provides credible, accurate and current information, is subject to adequate procedures for the review and updating of material;
  * Makes reasonable accommodations for users with disabilities, such as the visually impaired; 
  * Primarily focuses on information or educational content, rather than the promotion of a product or service; and

**********What is Usability.gov's Privacy Policy?**

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) respects the privacy of visitors to the Usability.gov Web site. 

**Why is information collected?** We may collect a limited amount of information on usage of the Web site for statistical purposes, in order to measure the number of visitors to the various sections of our site and to help us make our site more useful to visitors. 

**What information is collected?** The information collected includes standard server log information, such as the domain name or IP address from which you access the Internet, the date and time you access our site, the pages you viewed, the type of browser and operating system you used to access our site, and, if you linked to our site from another Web site, that Web site's address. We collect this information on an aggregate basis only. Our Web site logs are not personally identifiable, and we make no attempt to link them with the individuals who actually browse the site. For example, we track which pages are most popular among visitors as a whole, but pages viewed are not identified with individual users. With email inquiries, we store the inquiry and the email address information so that we can respond electronically. 

**What information is not collected?** Unless otherwise required by statute, we do not identify publicly who sends questions or comments to our Web site. We will not obtain information that will allow us to personally identify you when you visit our site, unless you choose to provide such information to us.
