### **What This Privacy Policy Covers**

This Privacy Policy explains the kinds of personal information collected by USAFIS Organization regarding individuals, and discusses how USAFIS Organization gathers, uses, processes, retains, and shares with third parties, the personal information that it collects, and other relevant matters.

### **Informed Consent**

Through your use of the USAFIS Organization website and/or application for any reason (such as to utilize the content and/or services offered, as well as to pay for different services offered on the USAFIS Organization website and/or the application), you hereby confirm that you have read, understand and agree to the conditions stated in this Privacy Policy, and you give your informed consent for all of the uses that are made or might be made by USAFIS Organization with the personal information that you provide on the company’s website (including the transfer of your personal information to third parties for the reasons stated in this Privacy Policy) and/or of the personal information that will be gathered regarding your use of the company’s website, whether by itself or through third parties working on behalf of USAFIS Organization.

By your decision to submit your personal information to USAFIS Organization through its website and/or via the application and/or using any of the methods described in this Privacy Policy, you hereby declare and obligate the following:

A. Personal information that you provide to USAFIS Organization belongs to you and is accurate, complete and correct.

B. USAFIS Organization will retain the personal information that you provide in the company’s data stores, and the company will be entitled to utilize that personal information and transfer it to third parties that cooperate with USAFIS Organization or act on its behalf, in adherence with the conditions this Privacy Policy sets forth.

### **Minors**

To the extent that your consent is a basis for collecting personal information about you, there is an age requirement for you to be at least 16 years of age (or to be at least 13 years of age, if this is what has been determined by the law in your country). In the event that you do not meet the minimum age requirements, you must receive consent from your parent or guardian so that information can be processed in adherence to this Privacy Policy, and if you lack such consent, the USAFIS Organization will not provide you with its services and/or products. The USAFIS Organization reserves the right, at the discretion of the company, to request information and proof regarding your age.

The USAFIS Organization recognizes the need to provide further privacy protections with respect to personal information the company may process from children on our websites, channels and applications. Personal information for underage individuals (aged 16 and less) will be stored only after their legal guardian consents, and will be used only to deliver the application to the relevant authorities. The USAFIS Organization won’t register an individual 16 years old (or younger) as a client.

### **When We Collect Your Personal Information**

USAFIS Organization collects personal information about you when you actively submit information to us through various means (including by email, telephone, postal delivery, online chat or social media, and/or when you provide your details in an application operated by our company), and we also gather information whenever you utilize our services, products or service channels, including through observation of your usage of our websites.

When you visit our website, our company system assigns an identifying number to the device that you used to access our website and a cookie file is installed on that device. There may also be times when our company permits the installation of cookie files on your device (either on a temporary basis or permanently) by third parties which are related to their websites, services and/or products.

### **Data Controller**

USAFIS Organization serves as the Data Controller of the personal information about you.

In the event that you have enrolled to receive services offered by USAFIS Organization, but a portion of that service is provided by a third party, the third party will serve as a separate “Data Controller.”

Furthermore, USAFIS Organization is part of a Group of companies that also includes: AbroadEd, AustraliaGSM, Canadian Visa Expert, International Job Master, Jobs Across The World, Natively Academy, and New Zealand Visa Expert.

Each company in the Group conducts certain activities that make up a portion of the Group’s overall activity, which involves relocation, immigration, and education. In this activity, the members of the Group share among themselves personal information about individuals for their internal purposes.

Thus, personal information that USAFIS Organization collects about you may be shared with the other companies in the Group and these other companies may utilize that personal information only for their internal requirements. Similarly, personal information collected about you by other companies in the Group may be shared with USAFIS Organization, which will utilize it only for its internal purposes.

In each of the above cases, USAFIS Organization and the other companies in the Group will be considered “Joint Data Controllers” in regards to personal information about you, and they will be responsible individually and collectively for complying with the requirements to safeguard your personal information.

If you would like to realize your rights about personal information or should you have any questions about activities related to the processing of your personal information, please feel free to contact USAFIS Organization, which will handle your request even if it involves another member of the Group, at the company’s address provided above, or by sending an email to: [privacy@usafis.org](mailto:privacy@usafis.org)

### **Sharing Personal Data with Third Parties**

There is no obligation for you to provide your personal information to USAFIS Organization. It should be noted, however, that USAFIS Organization may not be able to provide you with the services and/or products that you request from our company unless you submit your personal information.

Although you are not required to provide USAFIS Organization with your personal information, there are certain situations in which providing your personal information is a necessary condition for establishing a contractual relationship between you and USAFIS Organization.

Notwithstanding the aforementioned, these rules will apply concerning particular users: In general, with the exception of any lawful requirement for users to provide our company with specific information, you are not legally obligated to provide USAFIS Organization with your personal information, and you have the freedom to decide whether or not to do so. In the event that you decide not to provide USAFIS Organization with your personal information in accordance with the company’s requirements, USAFIS Organization may be prevented from responding to your request and/or may not be able to provide you with the services and/or products that you ask to receive.

### **You May Request That Your Personal Information Not be Used for Marketing**

USAFIS Organization seeks to take into account the needs and personal preferences of its potential and current customers in order to provide them with relevant content and offers. With this goal in mind, USAFIS Organization conducts analyses of personal information using certain technologies and techniques in order to reach conclusions regarding content and offers that you may find personally relevant. Furthermore, to the extent that you agree to be sent marketing offers from USAFIS Organization, our company can refine its offers made to you by using the conclusions drawn from these analyses of your data. USAFIS Organization is using the following domains to send customers who provided their consent to receive promotional, transactional & other types of emails through the email marketing channel: usafisnews.org, email.usafis-mail.net, usafis.com, including its main sending domain usafis.org.
