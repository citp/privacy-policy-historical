**What information do we collect?**

U.S. College Search collects personally identifiable information you voluntarily choose to disclose and "aggregate information" that is automatically collected when you visit the web site.

Personally identifiable information refers to information that tells us specifically who you are and is collected when you choose to request information from a school that is listed on the site. This information can include your name, current e-mail address, programs of interest and other information you choose to provide. If you choose to correspond with us through e-mail, we may retain your e-mail address and messages together with our responses.

Aggregate information is automatically provided by your computer and cannot be tied back to you as a specific individual. Examples include:

  * referral data (the web sites you visited just before and just after the web site)
  * date and time of your visits
  * pages viewed and time spent at the web site
  * browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform)

**Cookies**

U.S. College Search uses cookie technology to allow us to deliver customized information to you and track which site features are most popular. Cookies let sites and advertisers "remember" users across pages of a site and across multiple visits to a site. In addition, your computer may occasionally receive cookies from our advertisers. U.S. College Search does not control these cookies, and they are not subject to our Privacy Policy. You can disable cookies, but doing so may impact the functioning of parts of the U.S. College Search site.

**How do we use the personal information that you provide to us?**

Broadly speaking, your personal information is used to help match your interests with schools that provide the training you seek. If your search yields no results, we may store your information and send you updates if and when programs you specified do become available. We also use personal information for purposes of administering our business activities, providing customer service, and making other products and services available to our customers and prospective customers. Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to the web site, new services and special offers we think you will find valuable.

**Information collected in ad delivery**

U.S. College Search may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single-pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous.

**How do we protect your information?**

We utilize encryption/security software to safeguard the confidentiality of personal information we collect. This software provides a limited degree of protection against unauthorized access or disclosure, as well as accidental loss, alteration or destruction.

**Do we comply with legally compelled disclosure of information?**

We may release any private information about you that we possess when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, to enforce or apply our Privacy Policy and/or other agreements, or to protect the rights, property or safety of U.S. College Search, the site users, or others.
