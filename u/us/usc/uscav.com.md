Safe and Secure Shopping

We are aware that our customers have concerns regarding the use of credit cards over the Internet. We share your concern and have provided the ability to encrypt your transactions using our Secured Sockets Layer (SSL), ensuring that your ordering information remains private, protected, and secure. This means that your name, address, credit card numbers and any other information you provide through our SSL, cannot be read by anyone else.
