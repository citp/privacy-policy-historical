**_Safe & Secure Shopping!_**

We are aware that our customers have concerns regarding the use of credit cards over the Internet. We share your concern and have provided the ability to encrypt your transactions using our Secured Sockets Layer ([SSL](https://web.archive.org/web/20021209121103id_/http%3A//www.uscav.com/uscprivacy.asp#ssl)), ensuring that your ordering information remains private, protected, and secure. This means that your name, address, credit card numbers and any other information you provide through our SSL, cannot be read by anyone else. In order for you to take advantage of this technology, you must be using an [SSL-enabled browser](https://web.archive.org/web/20021209121103id_/http%3A//www.uscav.com/uscprivacy.asp#browsers). So you can rest assured that your credit card information is safe and protected ( **Much more safer than using your credit card at a store or restaurant!** ).

  


**_SSL-Enabled Browsers_**

* Netscape Navigator 2.0 to current version
* Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 to current version
* AOL 3.0 to current version

  


**_What is SSL?_**

SSL, or Secured Sockets Layer, is a program layer that was created to ensure that data transferred between a client (your computer) and a server (our computer) remains private by encrypting it. When a client and server connect via a Secured Sockets Layer, the client authenticates the server and then they agree on the security keys that they will use for the session. After this connection has been established, SSL encrypts and decrypts all information passing between the two computers (client requests and server responses). 

**_How can I tell if my computer is connected via SSL?_**

When you click on the 'Click to Pay' button on our web site, you are taken to the secured area automatically. You will notice that the URL heading is now HTTPS in the URL window, and if you are using Netscape, the closed padlock icon appears in the lower left corner of the browser (In Internet Explorer, it is about midway at the bottom). If you are using a browser that does not have support for HTTP over SSL, you will not be able to access URLs beginning with HTTPS. These non-SSL browsers will simply not allow the submission of forms that require secure submission.
