			<h1>U.S. College Search Privacy Policy&amp;Terms of Use</h1>
			<p>Our
Privacy Policy was developed as an extension of our commitment to
combine the highest-quality products and services with the highest
level of integrity. It is designed to assist you in understanding how
we collect, use and safeguard the personal information you provide and
to help you in making informed decisions when using our site, products
and services. This Privacy Policy will be continually assessed against
new technologies, business practices and our customers' needs.</p>
			<p>Access
to and use of the U.S. College Search web site is available only to
United States residents who can form legally binding contracts under
applicable law. If you do not qualify, you may not use the web site. In
compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998,
no one under 13 years of age can use the web site. If you are a minor
between the ages of 13 and 18, you may use the site only in conjunction
with your parent, legal guardian or other responsible adult.</p>
			<p>As
described below, some of your personally identifiable information will
be used by us and shared with third parties. By using the web site, you
expressly consent to our use of your personal information, and also to
the disclosure to and use of this information by third parties. You
acknowledge that communications to, from and through the U.S. College
Search web site are not confidential. You agree that by submitting
communications through the U.S. College Search web site, no
confidential, fiduciary, contractually implied or other relationship is
created between you and U.S. College Search other than pursuant to this
Privacy Policy. </p>
			<p><strong>What information do we collect?</strong></p>
			<p>U.S.
College Search collects personally identifiable information you
voluntarily choose to disclose and "aggregate information" that is
automatically collected when you visit the web site.</p>
			<p>Personally
identifiable information refers to information that tells us
specifically who you are and is collected when you choose to request
information from a school that is listed on the site. This information
can include your name, current e-mail address, programs of interest and
other information you choose to provide. If you choose to correspond
with us through e-mail, we may retain your e-mail address and messages
together with our responses.</p>
			<p>Aggregate information is
automatically provided by your computer and cannot be tied back to you
as a specific individual. Examples include:</p>
			<ul>








<li>referral data (the web sites you visited just before and just after the web site)</li>
<li>date and time of your visits</li>
<li>pages viewed and time spent at the web site</li>
<li>browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform)</li>
<li>Internet Protocol (IP) address. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer on the Internet.</li>
</ul>
			<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
			<p>U.S.
College Search uses cookie technology to allow us to deliver customized
information to you and track which site features are most popular.
Cookies let sites and advertisers "remember" users across pages of a
site and across multiple visits to a site. In addition, your computer
may occasionally receive cookies from our advertisers. U.S. College
Search does not control these cookies, and they are not subject to our
Privacy Policy. You can disable cookies, but doing so may impact the
functioning of parts of the U.S. College Search site.</p>
			<p><strong>How do we use the personal information that you provide to us?</strong></p>
			<p>Broadly
speaking, your personal information is used to help match your
interests with schools that provide the training you seek. If your
search yields no results, we may store your information and send you
updates if and when programs you specified do become available. We also
use personal information for purposes of administering our business
activities, providing customer service, and making other products and
services available to our customers and prospective customers.
Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you
about important changes to the web site, new services and special
offers we think you will find valuable.</p>
			<p><strong>Information collected in ad delivery</strong></p>
			<p>U.S.
College Search may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads
on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also
known as single-pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising
effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via
cookies and action tags is completely anonymous.</p>
			<p><strong>How do we protect your information?</strong></p>
			<p>We
utilize encryption/security software to safeguard the confidentiality
of personal information we collect. This software provides a limited
degree of protection against unauthorized access or disclosure, as well
as accidental loss, alteration or destruction.</p>
			<p><strong>Do we comply with legally compelled disclosure of information?</strong></p>
			<p>We
may release any private information about you that we possess when we
believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, to enforce or
apply our Privacy Policy and/or other agreements, or to protect the
rights, property or safety of U.S. College Search, the site users or
others.</p>
			<p><strong>What about other sites linked to U.S. College Search?</strong></p>
			<p>Many
of the links in the U.S. College Search web site allow you to leave the
site. Please be aware that once you leave the site and enter another
web site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. U.S. College
Search is not responsible for the privacy practices employed by these
sites, nor the information or content contained therein. Please read
over the rules and policies of these sites before proceeding.</p>
			<p>Although
our site is called U.S. College Search, we feature a variety of
educational options: technical schools, training centers, universities
and other institutions that may or may not be classified as colleges.</p>
			<p><strong>U.S. College Search web site accessibility statement</strong></p>
			<p>The
majority of the pages on this web site are accessible to individuals
with disabilities in accordance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation
Act. In addition, images on our web site are accompanied by alternative
text describing graphics if your browser supports the alt-text
function. Documents on our web site are generally accessible to users
