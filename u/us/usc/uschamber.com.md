**U.S. Chamber of Commerce Privacy Policy, applicable to uschamber.com/uschamber.org**

**General Statement of Privacy**

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce respects the privacy of its members and of those who visit this site. Subject to the provisions of applicable laws, any information you submit to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce will not be used in any manner to which you have not consented. While the U.S. Chamber does analyze its Web site logs to monitor the flow of traffic and make improvements to the site’s content, its Web site logs are not personally identifiable, and no attempt to link them to individual visitors to this site is made.

**Personally identifiable information**

We do not collect personally identifiable information about you on the U.S. Chamber Web site without your knowledge or action. Your information is collected through the membership registration form, e-mail newsletter registration and/or event registration forms. This information includes, but is not limited to, your name (first and last), company name, company address, phone number, fax number, e-mail address, and credit card information. You should be aware that if you disclose any information on a bulletin board or in a chat room or other open forum that is hosted by the U.S. Chamber, others may collect that information to send you unsolicited information from outside the U.S. Chamber, or for other purposes.

**Use of personally identifiable information**

We reserve the option to share your contact information with Chamberbiz, the U.S. Chamber’s small business Internet portal, and certain third parties. You will always have the ability to opt out from receiving information from the U.S. Chamber as well as third parties.

**Non-personally identifiable information**

Non-Personally Identifiable Information includes, but is not limited to, information we automatically collect on your use and/or actions on our Web site (e.g., user traffic patterns, page views on the Web site, click-through rates, search terms that users enter into our search utility). In addition, when a visitor arrives at our site, we collect the IP address, operating system and browser software used. An IP address (which is not the same as an e-mail address) can tell us the user's internet service provider and, based on that, can suggest the geographic location of the connection. The U.S. Chamber recognizes that certain User Information of a key demographic nature (e.g., race, age, gender, national origin, income), while Non-Personally Identifiable Information, is still of a sensitive nature to users. As a general matter, the U.S. Chamber does not collect such information about you through the uschamber.com Web site. However, in recognition of the sensitive nature of such information, in the event the U.S. Chamber comes into possession of such information, whether through your voluntary submission of such information in response to a special feature on the Web site or by receiving such information from any of our business partners, such information shall, when coupled with any of your Personally Identifiable Information, itself be deemed to be Personally Identifiable Information and treated by the U.S. Chamber as such. 

**Use of Non-personally identifiable information**

As a general matter, Non-Personally Identifiable Information helps us determine how the uschamber.com Web site is being used, helps us identify popular areas of the Web site, and helps determine the effectiveness of our promotional activities regarding the Web site.

Uschamber.com's cookies do not include personal information about you, but they are unique to each user and include a member ID # (a randomly generated unique number) that enables the chamberbiz.com website to identify you when you visit, so you: (1) do not have to remember your username and password each time you visit the Web site; and (2) receive any personalized services you requested when you registered. 

Neither our Web site, nor the cookies we write to the hard drives of our users, read any data off of your hard drive outside of our cookies. This includes not reading any cookie files created by other Web sites. You can refuse our cookies by turning them off in your browser (for more information on how to do this, please refer to your browser's documentation). You do not need to have cookies turned on in your browser to use our Web site; however, without cookies certain of the automated functions and features of our Web site will not be available to you. We also use cookies to measure the click through rate on e-mails delivered.
