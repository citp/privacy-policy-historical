    <p>We collect no personal information about you when you visit our website 
      unless you choose to provide this information to us. However, we collect 
      and store certain information automatically. Here is how we handle information 
      about your visit to our website. </p>
    <p><strong>What We Collect and Store Automatically </strong></p>
    <p>If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the website, read 
      pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain information 
      about your visit automatically. This information does not identify you personally. 
      We automatically collect and store only the following information about 
      your visit: </p>
    <ol>
      <li> The Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use 
        a private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you 
        connect from a university's domain) and IP address (an IP address is a 
        number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are 
        surfing the Web) from which you access our website; </li>
      <li> The type of browser and operating system used to access our site; </li>
      <li> The date and time you access our site; </li>
      <li> The pages you visit; and </li>
      <li> If you linked to our website from another website, the address of that 
        website. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>We use the information we collect to count the number and type of visitors 
        to the different pages on our site, and to help us make our site more 
        useful to visitors like you. 
    </p>
    <p><strong>If You Send Us E-mail </strong></p>
    <p>You may choose to provide us with personal information, as in e-mail with 
      a comment or question. We use the information to improve our service to 
      you or to respond to your request. Sometimes we forward your e-mail to other 
      government employees who may be better able to help you. Except for authorized 
      law enforcement investigations, we do not share our e-mail with any other 
      outside organizations. </p>
    <p><strong>Cookies </strong></p>
    <p>"Cookies" are small bits of text that are either used for the 
      duration of a session ("session cookies"), or saved on a user's 
      hard drive in order to identify that user, or information about that user, 
      the next time the user logs on to a Web site ("persistent cookies"). 
      This Web site does not use persistent cookies or any other persistent tracking 
      technology. One or more of our component sites may use session cookies to 
      provide streamlined navigation. These session cookies are deleted from the 
      component's server after your session ends and information from them is 
      not collected or saved. </p>
    <p><strong>Information Protection </strong></p>
    <p>For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available 
      to all users, this government computer system employs software programs 
      to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or 
      change information, or otherwise cause damage. If such monitoring reveals 
      evidence of possible abuse or criminal activity, such evidence may be provided 
      to appropriate law enforcement officials. Unauthorized attempts to upload 
      or change information on this server are strictly prohibited and may be 
      punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National 
      Information Infrastructure Protection Act or other law. </p>
