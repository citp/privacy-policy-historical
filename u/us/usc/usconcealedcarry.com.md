This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.

We use your data to provide and improve the Service. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, the terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions.

We are strongly committed to safeguarding consumer privacy on our website. We operate under the following set of strict privacy principles:

The only information our website will obtain from you is information we need to process credit card charges of membership fees or for other purchases. That information is never revealed, resold, or made public for any reason.

Our Online Community collects information from you when you register on our site and gathers data when you participate in the forum by interacting with content there.

When registering on our community, you may be asked to enter your name and e-mail address. You may, however, visit our community without registering. Your e-mail address will be verified by an email containing a unique link. If that link is visited, we know that you control the e-mail address.

When registered and posting in the community, we record the IP address that the post originated from. We also may retain server logs which include the IP address of every request to our server.

To protect your privacy when posting or replying to messages in the community message board, your personal information and email are not revealed.

However, remember that any information that you disclose in the message board areas can be read by all other members, so exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.

Personally identifiable information that you provide to us (name, e-mail or home address, etc.) is never disclosed to anyone.

The 3rd party platforms are responsible for protecting your privacy on their platforms. For more information about these platforms, see their Privacy Policies and Terms of Use. These platforms are considered to be “public forums” so the information you post is “public information”. Public information is information that is public and can be seen by anyone, at anytime, and can be shared on any platform or website.

Remember that any information that you disclose on a 3rd party public forum is public information so exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information such as your name or pictures of yourself.

The USCCA reserves the right to utilize any posts, comments, or reviews made by any person on any USCCA webpage, the USCCA community pages, and on any 3rd party platform forum associated with the USCCA for marketing purposes.
