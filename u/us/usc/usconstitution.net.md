# Our Privacy Policy - The U.S. Constitution Online - USConstitution.net

USConstitution.net is concerned about your privacy, as you might guess from the subject matter on this site. This site is also frequented by people of all ages, as young as elementary school children, on up to centegenarians. To ensure that all visitors are aware of our policies, the following privacy policy is being published.

**Collection of Personal Information**

USConstitution.net is available to all, without need for registration or login. With one exception, no one from this web site will ask any one to provide a name, address, or any other type of personal information.

The Message Boards maintained on this site do request several pieces of information that can be considered personal information. However, all of this information is entirely optional. The Message Board may be read without any divulgence of any information. New messages may even be posted without any login or registration. However, as a courtesy to other visitors, you may wish to become a registered user of the message boards. When you register, we do request the following personal information:

  * Name 
  * Email address 
  * Gender 
  * Birth date 
  * Location 
  * WWW site 
  * Instant Messenger codes 



Frequent users may wish to register. Registered users choose a user name and password. All other information listed above is optional. Even the name you provide can be blank or a pseudonym. The email address **must** , however, be valid so that the message board software can mail you your initial password. By creating a profile, you protect yourself - no one else will be able to user your user name without the password that is on file. As noted, however, registration is totally optional.

Children 12 and under should get parental permission before registering and using their real name to post messages or before registering as a user.

USConstitution.net does request that users who choose to use a pseudonym or handle use the same one consistently. Other Message Board policies [are posted and available](https://web.archive.org/web/20081217173224id_/http%3A//www.usconstitution.net/constpolicy.html).

In addition to the information discussed above, each message posted includes the IP address of the computer posting the message. The IP address is saved to allow tracking and filtering of anyone who abuses or misuses the Message Board system. The IP address is stored internally, and is accessible only by the Webmaster.

**Cookies**

Cookies are not used on this site to store any information, unless you post to the Message Board. In that case, your user name is saved along with an encoded version of your password, so that you do not need to login each time you visit the site. The cookie from USConstitution.net can safely be deleted at any time, though if you delete your cookie and intend to post to the message boards, you will have to login before you can use your user name.

**Links**

The pages at USConstitution.net contain many links, some within the site and some outside the site. USConstitution.net has no control over external links. Some links may point to sites that contain material unsuitable for children. Parental guidance is suggested.

**Questions**

If you have any questions about this policy or about USConstitution.net, please [email the webmaster](https://web.archive.org/web/20081217173224id_/http%3A//www.usconstitution.net/mailtowm.php3).
