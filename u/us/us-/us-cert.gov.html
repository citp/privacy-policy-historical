<div class="heading1">US-CERT Privacy Policy</div><p>
Thank you for visiting the US-CERT website of the Department of Homeland
Security and reviewing our privacy policy.  This privacy policy governs this
website and our activities - and yours - when you visit this site. Our
privacy policy is plain and simple. We collect NO personal information like
names or addresses when you simply visit our website.  However, if you choose
to subscribe ("opt in") to one of our information products by submitting your
email address, we will retain and use your email address solely to send you
the information product(s) you request, and for no other purpose, except as
provided in this agreement (see  Site Security, below) or explicitly
agreed to by you. If you choose to provide other personal information such as
your name and address, that information will only be used to fulfill your
request for information.            

</p><p>
We do collect some technical information when you visit to make your visit seamless.  The section below explains how we handle and collect technical information when you visit our website.            
</p><blockquote>
<p>
</p><div class="heading2">Information Collected and Stored Automatically</div>

When you browse, read pages, or download information on this website, we
automatically gather and store certain technical information about your visit.
This information never identifies who you are.  The information we collect and
store about your visit is listed below:             
<ul>
<li>The Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect from a university's domain) and IP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) from which you access our website;            

<p></p></li><li>The type of browser (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer) and operating system (Windows, Unix) used to access our site;            
<ul>
<li> The date and time you access our site;
</li><li> The pages you visit; and
</li><li>If you linked to this website from another website, the address of that website.            
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p> This information is only used to help us make the site more useful for you.  With this data we learn about the number of visitors to our site and the types of technology and information our visitors use.  We never track or record information about individuals and their visits.            
</p><p>
</p><div class="heading2">Cookies </div>
When you visit some websites, their webservers generate pieces of information known as cookies.  Some cookies collect personal information to recognize your computer in the future.  This is not the case at this website, where the only cookies we will ever use are non-persistent cookies or "session" cookies.  These cookies do not collect personal information on users and they are erased as soon as you leave our website.
   <p>  
Session cookies serve technical purposes like providing seamless navigation through this website.  These cookies do not permanently record data and they are not stored on your computer's hard drive.  These cookies are stored in memory and are only available during an active browser session.  Again, once you close your browser, the cookie disappears.            
</p><p>
</p><div class="heading2">If You Send Us Personal Information</div>
If you choose to join the mailing list for one of our information products by
submitting your email address, or choose to provide us with personal
information - like filling out a Contact Us form with personal information and
submitting it to us through the website, we use that information to send you the information product(s) you requested, or to respond to your message and to help us get you the information you have requested.  
<p>
We only share the information you give us with another government agency if your inquiry relates to that agency, or as otherwise required by law. We do not create individual profiles or give your information to private sector organizations for marketing or other purposes. US-CERT does not collect information for commercial marketing.            
</p><p>
</p><div class="heading2">Site Security</div>
<ul>
<li> For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, this government computer system employs commercial software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.            
<p>
</p></li><li>Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits. Raw data logs are used for no other purposes and are scheduled for regular destruction in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration guidelines.
    <p>        
       </p></li><li> Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on this service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act.            
</li></ul>
