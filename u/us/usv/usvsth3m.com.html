<p>We are committed to protecting the personal information you give us and telling you how we use the information we gather about you </p>
<p><strong>WHY WE COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT YOU</strong></p>
<p>We want to offer you a service which you want to use. We may use information about you to help us customise the Website, to remember you and to improve its usefulness to you. We may use this information to notify you about changes to the Website or products, services or promotions of ours and others (with your consent) that we think you might find of interest. It can also help us to choose articles and services we think will interest you.</p>
<p>Information about you helps us sell space to advertisers of products and services relevant to you so that we can continue to fund the Website through advertising and you can continue to use the Website for free. </p>
<p>We may send you administrative and promotional emails relating to the Website and updates about the Website. </p>
<p>We may personalise your visits to the Website and develop the design and style of the Website to improve the services provided to you.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT FROM YOU?</strong></p>

<p><strong>HOW WE ENSURE PRIVACY IS MAINTAINED</strong></p>
<p>We endeavour to ensure that your data is stored securely and to prevent unauthorised access. We have security measures in place to protect your information which we monitor regularly. Unfortunately, despite our measures, because of the nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that your information will remain at all times 100% secure. The continuing efforts of hackers to defeat even the newest of security systems means that we can never make this promise. </p>
<p>Please be aware that if you disclose information on chat areas, your Profile page, comment areas, forums or other public services it may be possible for other people to use this information. We are not responsible for the disclosure of any information you post in this way. </p>

<p>In particular, even where we have your consent we will only disclose your financial, credit card or bank details to our agents and/or third party suppliers of products or services on a need to know basis including, for example, in relation to the fulfilment of any e-commerce transactions.</p>
<p>We may disclose details about use of the Website to other businesses e.g. to demonstrate patterns of use to advertisers and other business partners. The information we pass on will not include any personal information by which you may be identified. </p>
<p>We compile anonymous records of user trends which we may make use of ourselves, or pass to our associated companies. </p>
<p>We will comply with any court order requesting or requiring the disclosure of the identity or location of or any other information in relation to anyone who has accessed the Website and we may also disclose such information where we are advised by our lawyers that a court order would be granted requiring us to disclose it, even if no legal proceedings have been commenced in relation to the same. </p>
