THANK YOU for visiting the Postal Service’s Web site and reviewing our privacy commitment to you. Your privacy is of great importance to us and our Web site has been developed with that in mind. We recognize your right to know what information is being collected about you and how that information will be used, as well as our obligations to limit collection and protect what we do collect.

Our privacy policy tells you about our information practices when you visit us online to browse, obtain information, or conduct a transaction. The policy includes, among other things, what data is collected and why; ways for you to access information or submit inquiries; customer choices; security features; and Web analysis tools used. 

You will find major benefits in how we have developed our privacy policy including:

  * You do not have to register or provide personal information to visit our site, and we only collect personal information if specifically and knowingly provided by you. Personal information may include your name, email, mailing and/or business address, phone numbers, or other information that identifies you personally. 
  * The Postal Service does not sell or otherwise provide your personal information to outside parties. Partners and contractors that assist us in developing usps.com or in providing services for usps.com must adhere to our privacy requirements. 
  * The Postal Service uses cookies and other Web analysis tools for limited purposes, such as to perform statistical analyses of the use of the site, and to enable your use of certain features, like a shopping cart.



##### Information Collected and Stored Automatically

We collect certain information about your visit automatically. We limit this data collected to meet specific business needs and to fully protect your privacy. We do **not** use this information to identify you personally. We thus may know what path(s) you took on usps.com, but we don’t know who you are unless you choose to provide us personal information. 

We automatically collect and store the following information about your visit:

1\. General log information—Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" or "yourschool.edu"); Internet Protocol (IP) address; operating system; the browser used to access our Web site; the date and time you access our site; and the pages that you visited. 

2\. Referral and statistical information where we have links or ad banners to or from usps.com. Such data may include aggregate data such as the number of click-throughs that occurred. It may also include specific data, such as whether you are a repeat visitor; whether you viewed or clicked on an ad banner and used our site (for instance, to register or make a purchase); the value, date and time of any sale; and the identity of the site which you linked to or from usps.com. We do not use such data to identify you personally. 

We use the general site information to help us make usps.com more useful to visitors. We use it to learn about how the sections of our site are being used, what information is of most and least interest, and how we may enhance ease of use by ensuring usps.com can interface with the types of technology our visitors use. We also use such statistics to tell us of any possible site performance problems. 

We collect referral statistics from links to let us know which links are useful, both to and from usps.com. Likewise, we collect data from ad banners to let us know which ads are effective. This allows us to determine which ads may be of most interest and to help us control how many times a specific ad is displayed. 

This explains **what** information is collected automatically. For information about **how** this data is collected, see our policy on cookies and other Web analysis tools, below.

  
[See Postal Service Use of Cookies and Web Analysis Tools.](https://web.archive.org/common/docs/cookiepol.htm)  


##### Information collected from e-mails and on-line forms

Most of our Web pages allow you to send us an email. We will use the information you provide to respond to your inquiry, provide information, or to fill your order for postal products and services in which you have expressed an interest. 

Remember that email may not necessarily be secure against interception. If your email communication is very sensitive, or includes information such as your bank account, charge card, or social security number, you should send it by mail unless the Web site indicates the particular site is secured.

##### Security: Detection of unauthorized intrusions

For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, this computer system employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits other than those uses identified in this policy. Intentional misuse of secure information will be investigated and may result in federal prosecution.

##### Security: Secured Data Transmissions

In those instances where we secure your information in transit to us and upon receipt in order to safeguard your personal information, the Postal Service uses the industry standard encryption software, Secured Socket Layer (SSL). The URL in your browser will change to “HTTPS” instead of “HTTP” when this security feature is invoked. Your browser may also display a lock symbol on its bottom task bar line to indicate invoked secure transmission.

##### Privacy Act Rights

Some of our Web sites allow you to purchase postal products and services or request information electronically. We will collect the information needed to fulfill your order or request, just as though your order or request had been made on paper. That information will be maintained and protected in accordance with the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a. You will be provided a Privacy Act statement that tells you the purpose for collection and the potential disclosures that may be made of the information you provide. Under the Privacy Act, we are barred from otherwise disclosing the information.

##### Choice and Access by Third Parties

If you provide express specific consent, the Postal Service may use data collected to notify you of other USPS products or services in which you may be interested. 

Without further express consent from you, the Postal Service will: 1) use the information only to respond to your inquiry or provide the requested product or service; and 2) will not provide the information to any third parties, except entities assisting the USPS in providing products and services you request (“service providers”). 

The Postal Service enters into relationships with service providers in order to provide the highest quality product or service. Service providers may include an entity that provides assistance for the program, such as a call center; a provider of advertising services; or a partner for the program. Where the Postal Service has partnered with such an entity, we will indicate that partnership to you using such words as “Powered by…” 

The USPS holds service providers to the same rigorous standards of privacy that apply to the USPS, including being made subject to the Privacy Act, as applicable, and USPS privacy policies. Service providers that have access to sensitive information are also subject to security review.   


##### Access

You have the right to review any of your personal information the Postal Service has collected from you by contacting the program that provided you the product or service you requested. The Postal Service will correct or delete any inaccurate information upon your request.

##### Inquiries

We would like to hear from you if you have any questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or use of your data. Please contact us at privacy@email.usps.gov, or mail us at:

United States Postal Service  
Attn: Privacy Office  
475 L’Enfant Plaza, SW  
Washington, DC 20260-2200

We will investigate and respond to your inquiry. Your inquiry will be treated confidentially, and will not be shared with external parties, except USPS service providers.  


##### Information from Children

From time to time as part of a special Postal Service promotion, such as stamp collecting, we may request information from children under 13 years of age. We will do so only with parental notice and consent. In doing so, we will take all necessary steps to protect the privacy and safety of any child participating and will fully comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).
