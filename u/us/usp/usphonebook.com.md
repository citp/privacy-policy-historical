**Last Updated: January 30, 2009**  
USPhoneBook.com respects the privacy of our users and we have developed this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our commitment to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy is intended to describe to you our treatment of personally identifiable information that you provide to us as a user of USPhoneBook.com or our services, or otherwise provide to us through other means such as e-mail marketing from us or our partner web sites, the information we collect, how that information may be used, with whom it may be shared, and your choices about such uses and disclosures.  
We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully when using our web site or services or transacting business with us. By using our web site, including, without limitation, signing up for offers and/or continuing to receive information from AddressesAnywhere.com, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy, and you are acknowledging that we are not providing you with a consumer report, and are certifying that you will not use the information obtained from us for any purpose covered by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. §1681, et seq.).  
If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please refer to the end of this Privacy Policy for information on how to contact us.

**1\. Information we collect about you**  
_In general_. We may collect personal information that can identify you, such as your name and e-mail address, and other information that does not identify you.

**Information you provide.** We may collect, sell, or share any personal information you enter on our web site or provide to us in some other manner, including through e-mail marketing by us, and our partners and affiliates. This includes identifying information, such as your name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number, and, if you transact business with us, financial information such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information) (Please see "How we protect your personal information", below). 

**Information from other sources.** We may also periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from our partners and affiliates, and other third parties, and add it to our account information or other information we have collected.  
_Use of cookies and other technologies to collect information_. We use various technologies to collect information from your computer and about your activities on our web site.

**Information collected automatically.** We automatically collect information from your browser when you visit our web site. This information includes your IP address, your browser type and language, access times, the content of any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us (see "Cookies", below), and the referring web site address.

**Cookies.** We may employ "cookies" to help customize your access to our web site, and also for the delivery of targeted advertisements. A cookie is a piece of data stored on your hard drive containing information about you. Through the use of a cookie, we may automatically collect information about your online activity on our web site, such as the web pages you visit, the links you click, and the searches you conduct on our web site. Cookies have many benefits to enhance your experience at our web site and to facilitate the receipt of targeted advertisements. For instance, by setting a cookie on our web site, you do not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our web site. Even in the case where you reject a cookie, you may still use our web site. We use cookies to track, monitor and target the interests of our users to further enhance the experience on our web site, and for subsequent advertising and/or delivery purposes. To find out more about cookies, please visit <http://www.cookiecentral.com/>.

**Other Technologies.** For the purpose of formatting and delivering future marketing or sales campaigns (either electronic or direct), we may employ pixel tags (also known as clear gifs) to track: 1) the pages that our users visit on affiliate and/or partner web sites; and 2) user opens of, and clicks on, our targeted e-mail advertising. We reserve the right to employ user source information, including applicable category and interest(s), for the marketing of targeted e-mail messages on behalf of our clients. This source information may be shared with our third party marketing partners, and we reserve the right to retain cookie and pixel tag data indefinitely.

**Information collected by third-parties.** We may also work with other businesses to bring select retail opportunities to our users from us, our partner web sites, or our marketing partners, including affiliated third party advertisers. These e-mail campaigns may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with the e-mail marketing material. Users may remove themselves from a specific mailing list by utilizing the unsubscribe options that are present at the end of each e-mail we send on behalf of the list owner. Unsubscribing from one list will not automatically unsubscribe a user from all lists.

Please review "Your choices about collection and use of your information," below.

**3\. With whom we share your information**  
We want you to understand when and with whom we may share personal or other information we have collected about you or your activities on our web site or while using our services.  
_Personal information_. We do not share your personal information with others except as indicated below or when we inform you and give you an opportunity to opt out of having your personal information shared. We may share personal information with:

**Authorized service providers:** We may share your personal information with our authorized service providers that perform certain services on our behalf. These services may include sending direct and electronic mail, removing duplicate information from user lists, analyzing data, providing marketing analysis, and supporting our web site functionality. These service providers may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use such information for any other purposes. 

**Business partners:** We may collect, sell, or share any personal information you enter on our web site or provide to us in some other manner, including via e-mail marketing. We may also work with other businesses to bring select retail opportunities to our users via e-mail marketing campaigns by us, or our partner web sites/co-brands, or our marketing partners, including affiliated third party advertisers. The other businesses we work with may include: (a) providers of direct marketing services and applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation; (b) e-mail marketers; and (c) telemarketers. When you open, preview or click on the advertising portion of our e-mails and/or those of our marketing partners and/or affiliates, you have agreed to the terms set forth in our Privacy Policy, and agree that as a function of opening, previewing or clicking on the advertising portion of our e-mails, you will receive new or additional marketing communications from us, our marketing partners and/or affiliates. These e-mail campaigns may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with the e-mail marketing material. There are a number of places on our web site and in e-mail campaigns where you may click on a link to access other web sites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. These third-party web sites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those web sites. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party web sites you visit by clicking on the "privacy" link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.

**Direct mail partners.** From time to time we may share our e-mail/postal mailing list with selected providers of goods and services that may be of interest to you.

**E-mail lists.** Users may remove themselves from a specific mailing list by utilizing the unsubscribe options that are present at the end of each e-mail we send on behalf of the list owner. Unsubscribing from one list will not automatically unsubscribe a user from all lists.

**Other Situations.** We also may disclose your information:  


  * In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.
  * When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce our web site terms and conditions or other agreements or policies. 
  * In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy. The personal information which you provide to us is an asset of the company and may be included in the assets transferred in the event of a substantial corporate transaction. 
  * When we deem it necessary or appropriate including, without limitation, sharing your e-mail address with other third-parties for suppression purposes in compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, as amended from time to time, the Federal Trade Commission’s enabling regulations, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. §1681 et seq.). 



Any third parties to whom we may disclose personal information may have their own privacy policies which describe how they use and disclose personal information. Those policies will govern use, handling and disclosure of your personal information once we have shared it with those third parties as described in this Privacy Policy. If you want to learn more about their privacy practices, we encourage you to visit the web sites of those third parties. These entities or their servers may be located either inside or outside the United States.  
_Aggregated and non-personal information_. We reserve the right to provide aggregate or group data about USPhoneBook.com users for lawful purposes. Aggregate or group data is data that describes the demographics, usage, or characteristics of USPhoneBook.com participants as a group, without disclosing personally identifiable information. By opening a USPhoneBook.com account, you agree to allow USPhoneBook.com to provide such aggregate data to third parties. By agreeing to these terms, you hereby consent to the disclosure of any record or communication to any third party when AddressesAnywhere.com, in its sole discretion, determines the disclosure to be appropriate.

**4\. Third-party reports**  
The information contained in our reports comes from proprietary sources and third party suppliers, and is beyond our control to edit, modify, or change. You acknowledge and agree that we shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such information.

**5\. Your choices about collection and use of your information**  
You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our web site because such information may be required in order for you to have personalized recommendations presented to you; register as a user; purchase products or services; ask a question; or initiate other transactions on our web site. At any time you can choose to no longer receive commercial or promotional e-mails or newsletters from us by unsubscribing. In every marketing e-mail communication we send, there is an unsubscribe hyperlink that allows the recipient to unsubscribe from that specific marketing program by simply clicking the hyperlink provided and following the instructions provided. We attempt to process all such unsubscribe requests in a prompt fashion. However, after unsubscribing, we cannot guarantee that you will never receive another marketing mailing from us, because we may obtain your e-mail address in the future through a different e-mail marketing program that you have opted into. We can guarantee, however, that if you should ever receive another e-mail marketing communication from us, you will be able to remove your e-mail address via the unsubscribe hyperlink. Unsubscribing from one marketing list will not automatically unsubscribe a user from all marketing lists. We may send you other types of transactional and relationship e-mail communications, such as service announcements and administrative notices, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.

**6\. How we protect your personal information**  
We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. When users submit information at our web site, their information is protected both online and offline. The privacy of your personal information is very important to us and access to your information is strictly limited, and not accessible to the public. The servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure physical environment. We have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of personal information under our control. Currently, we use Secure Socket Layer Software ("SSL") to protect data and to secure any transactions. SSL encrypts information, including credit card numbers, names and addresses as they are transmitted over the Internet. Please be advised that, although we take every reasonable technological precaution available to protect your data, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot warrant that your informat ion will be absolutely secure and any transmission of data at or through our web site is at your own risk.  
Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's web site at <http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm> for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.  
To the extent that user credit card-specific information (or alternate user payment method information, such as PayPay, Google Check-Out, etc.) is collected by us and/or any of our partners and affiliates, this information will be kept in confidence and will not be shared with any third parties (other than consumer credit agencies) without the user's prior informed consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, USPhoneBook.com, our partners and affiliates reserve the right to share with third parties the fact that we have credit card information on file for specific users but we will not share the specific credit card information with third parties without the user's prior informed consent.
