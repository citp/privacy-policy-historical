<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><b>General</b></p>

<p>USNetAds LLC takes your privacy
seriously. We utilize safe, secure technology to protect your personally
identifiable information. This Privacy Policy describes how we treat the personal information
that we collect and receive through our websites.

when other users view your ad details, and that our website pages may be linked by third party
websites or search engines. You agree that we may send you email using your email
address if provided when the users viewing your ad want to contact you by using
our email system.</p>
