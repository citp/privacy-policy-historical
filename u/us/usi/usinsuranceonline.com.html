<span class="bigheading">OUR COMMITMENT TO YOUR PRIVACY</span>

<p>
<span class="heading">Introduction</span>.
We want to make your experience online satisfying and
safe. This site is owned and operated by All Web
Leads, Inc., a Delaware corporation (collectively "<span class="term">Company</span>,"
"<span class="term">we</span>" or "<span class="term">us</span>")
headquartered in Austin, Texas. We understand that you value your
privacy. This privacy policy ("<span class="term">Privacy Policy</span>")
governs information that you provide to us and information that we
gather from your use of this website, and it tells you how we may
collect, use, and share this information.
</p>

<p>
Except as described in this Privacy Policy, or
unless we are given permission by you, we will not sell or disclose your
personally identifiable information to third parties.
</p>

<p>
<span class="heading">Why do we collect your information?</span>

We help consumers shop for insurance and various other
products by connecting consumers with insurance agents or other vendors,
as applicable. By clicking "Get My Quotes" and seeking a quote request,
you authorize and agree that we may use the information you share with
us to help match you with insurance providers or other vendors (as
applicable) through introducing you to insurance agents, insurance
companies, and/or other vendors, as applicable, who also assist us and
you in finding insurance agents, insurance companies, discount program
representatives and/or other requested products or services, as
applicable (we refer to all of these as "<span class="term">Providers</span>",
and we sometimes refer to both consumers and Providers as our "<span class="term">users</span>") to help you obtain free quotes for insurance,
discount health plans or other products or services, as applicable.
&nbsp;Insurance companies establish their rates using a variety of criteria.
Since we deal with many Providers, the more detailed information you
provide to us, the more accurate a quote our Providers may help you
locate.
</p>


<span class="bigheading">INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT</span>

<p>
<span class="heading">What do we collect and how do we use it?</span>

By clicking “Get My Quotes” and requesting an
insurance quote, you acknowledge and agree that up to eight (8)
Providers may contact you using your information to provide your
requested quote or to obtain additional information needed to provide
your requested quotes where permitted by law. You further acknowledge
and agree that each Provider that receives your quote request from this
website or our affiliates may confirm your information through the use
of a consumer report, which may include your credit score and driving
record. You acknowledge that you have read and understand the Terms and Conditions of Use 
of this website and agree to be bound by them. We are not responsible, and shall not be held
liable, if a Provider or other third party to whom we have forwarded any
of the information you submitted to us violates our Privacy Policy or
such third party’s own privacy policy (if any), or otherwise violates
the law.
</p>

<p>
Our users may from time-to-time provide us with
personally identifiable information. Personally identifiable information
generally means any information that may be used to identify an
individual, including, but not limited to, your name, home address,
telephone number, and email address.
</p>

<p>
Examples of personally identifiable information may include:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>First and Last Name</li>
	<li>Postal Address</li>
	<li>Email Address</li>
	<li>Phone Number</li>
	<li>Driver’s License Number*</li>
	<li>Date of Birth</li>
</ul>

<p>
<em>* While not required,
this information may be helpful in processing your request to receive
insurance or other quotations.</em>
</p>

<p>
We process personally identifiable information as described herein and also for such purposes as:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>To deliver our products and services to users, including the display of customized content and advertising;</li>
	<li>To conduct research and analysis in order to maintain and improve our products and services;</li>
	<li>Ensuring the technical functioning of our system and network;</li>
	<li>To aid us in developing new services;</li>
	<li>To alert you to product updates, special offers, updated information and other new services. (You may opt-out of these communications if you so choose.); and</li>
	<li>To contact you in response to your requests for information.</li>
</ul>

<p>
We may aggregate information we receive from
you and from our other users and may use or disclose this information to
third parties in a manner that does not disclose any such personally
identifiable information.
</p>

<span class="bigheading">IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING CONSUMER REPORT PRACTICES</span>

<p>
AS STATED ABOVE, BY CLICKING "GET MY QUOTES"
AND SEEKING A QUOTE REQUEST, YOU AUTHORIZE AND AGREE THAT A PROVIDER MAY
OBTAIN ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION ABOUT YOU TO PROVIDE YOU WITH
YOUR REQUESTED INSURANCE QUOTE OR POLICY INFORMATION. FOR EXAMPLE,
CONSUMER AND/OR CREDIT REPORTS, OR DRIVING RECORDS, MAY BE ORDERED IN
CONNECTION WITH YOUR QUOTE REQUEST. THESE REPORTS MAY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL
INFORMATION THAT MAY ASSIST PROVIDERS IN DETERMINING YOUR ELIGIBILITY
FOR INSURANCE, DISCOUNT HEALTH PLANS OR OTHER PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, AND
RATES THAT YOU MAY BE CHARGED. CONSUMER REPORTS MAY ALSO BE USED FOR
UPDATES, RENEWALS, OR EXTENSIONS OF ANY INSURANCE YOU MAY OBTAIN. A
PROVIDER MAY ALSO OBTAIN AND USE A CREDIT-BASED INSURANCE SCORE
CONTAINED IN YOUR CREDIT REPORT. THIS INFORMATION MAY BE COMBINED BY A
PROVIDER WITH INFORMATION YOU SUBMIT TO US, AND BY CLICKING SUBMIT AND
SEEKING A QUOTE REQUEST, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ARE PROVIDING YOUR
WRITTEN PERMISSION TO OUR PROVIDERS TO OBTAIN YOUR CREDIT REPORT.
</p>

<span class="bigheading">USAGE TRACKING</span>

<p>
<span class="heading">Usage Data Generally</span>.

Like many internet companies, we track website and service usage data to
improve the services we offer and the security of your interaction with
the site. We collect user traffic patterns throughout our website. This
information is collected to help improve website flow and usability. In
addition, we track click-through information, including IP addresses, to
our website from the reports and emails we send to our users. This is
done to gauge the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns, to
discourage fraudulent use and to improve the security of our site and
your interaction with the site.
</p>

<p>
<span class="heading">Cookies</span>.

We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The
cookie will enable us to relate your use of this website to information
that you have specifically and knowingly provided. The only personally
identifiable information a cookie can contain is information that you
yourself supply. A cookie cannot read data off your hard disk or read
cookie files created by other websites that are not owned by us. We may
use cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above). In
addition, we may use encrypted cookies to authenticate the user on each
page after the user logs onto any portion of our website requiring a
login. You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If
you have set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will
receive the warning message with each cookie. Some of our features and
services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.
</p>

<p>
<span class="heading">User Access</span>.

We make a good-faith effort to enable you to update personally identifiable
information you have provided to us and to enable you to request
deletion of any of your information. Please understand that while we are
able to delete or update the information that we have received from you,
this does not necessarily mean that information about you that has
already been shared by us with other Providers may, at the same time, be
updated or deleted by such other Providers. So, in some cases it may be
necessary for you to contact other third parties who may have received
your information and separately request updates to or deletions of your
information. We may decline to process user requests that are
unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate
technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, would be extremely
impractical, or where information is required to be retained by us,
either by law or for legitimate business purposes.
</p>


<span class="bigheading">INFORMATION TRANSFER AND SHARING POLICY</span>

<p>
<span class="heading">Generally</span>.

When you begin to provide personally identifiable information to us, you do so
for the purpose of our sharing this information with Providers to
provide you with the quotes you requested, and this information then
becomes subject to each Provider’s own privacy policy (if any). Federal
and state laws provide limitations on the information practices of
financial institutions such as insurance companies. Providers and others
to whom we may forward your personally identifiable information may
contact you with a quote by email, telephone, postal mail, or other
forms of communication as permitted by law and you agree to receive such
contacts when you submit your information, regardless of the presence of
your phone number(s) on any local or national no-call or similar no
solicitation list. Except as disclosed in this Privacy Policy, we do not
share personally identifiable information collected from you on this
website with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Please
understand that because we are in the business of helping consumers and
Providers identify one another, if you are a consumer and you do not
permit us to share your personally identifiable information with a
Provider, we will be unable to assist you and certain of our services
and offerings will be unavailable to you. We expect our Providers to
whom we forward your information to follow applicable laws and abide by
the restrictions we impose on their use of your personally identifiable
information.
</p>

<p>
<span class="heading">Other Usage and Offerings</span>.

As our business grows, from time to time we may seek to make
available additional offerings and services including those that may not
be insurance-related. In doing so, we will strive to give our users
choices about whether or not you would like to continue to receive
future promotional or marketing communications from us either directly
or on behalf of others whose offerings we think may be of interest to
you. In identifying which offerings we think may be of interest to you,
we may use and analyze information you have provided to us. If you
choose not to receive such marketing communications, you may still
receive certain relationship or transactional communications from us as
described herein. We do not plan to sell, rent or transfer your
personally identifiable information for non-insurance related purposes
to any third parties unless or except in connection with the merger,
sale or reorganization of our business as set forth elsewhere in this
policy.
</p>

<p>
<span class="heading">Aggregate information</span>.

We may occasionally share aggregate information with third parties, such
as how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. Aggregate
information does not personally identify you or otherwise allow anyone
to identify you individually.
</p>

<p>
<span class="heading">Vendors and Suppliers</span>.

We may provide personally identifiable information to or permit access
to personally identifiable information by our subsidiaries, affiliated
companies, vendors and service providers for the purpose of processing
personally identifiable information on our behalf, or where such access
is incidental to their assisting us. We expect that these parties will
only process such information based on our instructions and in
compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate
confidentiality and security measures.
</p>

<p>
<span class="heading">Protecting Our Legal Rights and Others’ Rights</span>.

We do not otherwise share personally
identifiable information about website users with third parties unless
we believe using or sharing such information is appropriate to carry out
a user’s request or if we have a good-faith belief that access, use,
preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary
to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or
enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce our <a href="terms.php">Terms
and Conditions of Use</a>, including investigation of potential
violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud,
security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to
the rights, property or safety of the Company, its users or the public
as required or permitted by law.
</p>

<p>
<span class="heading">Merger or Sale of Company</span>.

If we should ever file for bankruptcy or have our assets sold
to or merged with another entity, information that we receive from you
through this website may be treated as an asset of the Company and may
be transferred to the fullest extent permitted by law.
</p>

<p>
<span class="heading">Promotions and Programs</span>.

From time to time, you may be given the opportunity to
participate in sweepstakes, contests, giveaways, or other promotions and
programs offered by us, either alone or with promotional partners.
Participation in these promotions or programs may require you to submit
additional information about you, including personally identifiable
information. Our use and sharing of your information, including
personally identifiable information, collected through a promotion or
program will be governed by the official rules or agreement governing
that promotion or program, as well as by this Privacy Policy. The terms
of those rules or that agreement will have control over any conflicting
provisions of this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<span class="bigheading">MARKETING AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS</span>

<p>
When you submit information to us, you agree to
receive email, fax, and other forms of communications from us and those
to whom you have authorized us to forward your personally identifiable
information. If you would like to opt-out of receiving promotional or
marketing material from us in the future, &nbsp;please click the following
link: <a href="unsubscribe.php">UNSUBSCRIBE</a>: Your decision to opt-out
shall not preclude us from communicating with you regarding your
existing or past relationship with us and shall not preclude us,
including our employees, contractors and other representatives, from
accessing and using the information you have provided in a manner that
is not personally identifying (such as in aggregate or anonymous form).
If you do not wish to receive further communications from any person or
entity (such as a Provider) to whom we have forwarded your information
with your permission, you must contact them directly.
</p>


<span class="bigheading">AFFILIATED WEBSITES, OTHER WEBSITES, AND ADVERTISEMENTS</span>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies to websites and
services that are owned and operated by All Web Leads, Inc. We do not
exercise control over the websites of third parties that you may link to
or view as part of a frame on a page on this website. These other sites
may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect
data, or solicit personally identifiable information from you. We are
not responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. You
should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when
providing information on a feature or page operated by a third party.
You should always be careful in how you use and share any sensitive
personal information with any third party.
</p>

<span class="bigheading">AUTHORIZED USERS</span>

<p>
This website is hosted in the United States and
is intended exclusively for U.S. residents. In using this website you
represent and warrant that you have any and all necessary authorization
to submit the information contained in your requests, and that you
expressly consent to the transfer, use, and forwarding by us of the
information you provide to us through the website and to the United
States.
</p>

<span class="bigheading">SECURITY</span>

<p>
No data transmissions over the Internet can be
guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant
the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your
own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts
to ensure security on our systems. We use secure server software and
firewalls as part of our efforts to protect your information from
unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However,
please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not
be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of such
firewalls and secure server software. By using our site, you acknowledge
that you understand and agree to assume these risks.
</p>

<p>
If we learn of a security systems breach, we
may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take
appropriate protective steps. By using this website or providing
personally identifiable information to us you agree that we can
communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy and
administrative issues relating to your use of this website. We may post
a notice on our website if a security breach occurs. We may also send an
email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these
circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right
to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free
written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from
receiving electronic notice) you should notify us by clicking the
following link: &nbsp;Privacy Support.
</p>

<span class="bigheading">INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM PROVIDERS</span>

<p>
If you are a Provider, in addition to the
provisions of this Privacy Policy that are generally applicable to all
of our users, your use of this site is also governed by any written
agreement between you and the Company. We use the information shared
with us by our Providers to help match Providers with a consumer who is
interested in learning more about such Providers’ insurance products or
services. We may also request additional information from our Providers
to create an account, including information regarding applicable
insurance licenses and method of payment.
</p>

<span class="bigheading">CHANGES AND UPDATES</span>

<p>
We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy,
and we expect that most such changes will be minor. When we make
changes, we will also revise the "revised date" on the Privacy Policy.
If we should decide to change this Privacy Policy in a manner that we
believe would cause us to use or share your personally identifiable
information in a way that we think is materially broader or less
privacy-friendly from what we have told you here, we will use reasonable
efforts to obtain your consent before implementing the change. We
encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay
informed about how we are protecting the personally identifiable
information we collect. Your submission of a quote request and/or other
use of this website constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy
and any updates.
