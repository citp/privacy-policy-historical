<h1>US IDENTIFY’S PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

<p><b>Last Updated: May 7, 2013</b></p>

<p>US Identify, Inc. (“US Identify”, "us", "our" or "we") who owns and controls the website found at www.USIdentify.com has developed this Privacy Policy which details important information regarding the use and disclosure of user information collected on www.USIdentify.com, and any successor websites, (collectively, the “Site”), and other interactive properties, including but not limited to our mobile applications and mobile-focused websites (the Site and other US Identify’s interactive properties are collectively referred to herein as the “US Identify Applications").  This Privacy Policy also applies to our offline collection of information. </p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to our Terms of Use (“Terms”). By clicking your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and Terms of Use during the registration process on the Site you are entering into a legally binding agreement with US Identify based upon the terms of these policies.  Each time that you access US Identify Applications or our Services you signify that you agree to be bound by the Terms and this Privacy Policy, acknowledge that we are not providing you with a consumer report, and agree that you will not use the information obtained from us for any purpose covered by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. §1681, et seq.).  If you do not agree to the Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, you must discontinue using the US Identify Applications or Services.</p>

<p><b>I.  INFORMATION WE COLLECT</b></p>

<p><b><u>Information Provided Directly by You To US Identify</u></b></p>
<p><b>Registration Information.</b>  We will collect personal information from you if you register with us or subscribe to our Services ("Personal Information").  Any information you provide before registering with us is not associated with you individually and is not retained by US Identify unless you register with us. When you register you are required to provide certain categories of information, such as name, e-mail address, billing information and a password. </p>
<p><b>Searching for people.</b>  When you are searching for people, you may enter third party personal information such as their name, address, phone, email or social security number. We only use the data you input to provide you with a search request.  We retain the results of your search requests for a period of time at our discretion but do not use that information for any other purpose and have no obligation to maintain such search results.</p>
<p><b>Optional Information.</b>  At various other points during your visit to US Identify, you may be asked to provide information about yourself. The use of other services which require the input of additional information is completely voluntary on your part.  You have the choice about whether to disclose the information necessary to use these features of our US Identify Applications.</p>
<p><b>Feedback.</b>  In addition, during your visit to our Site, you may be asked to provide feedback, ideas, suggestions, and/or proposals (“Feedback”) with regard to our products and services.  Submission of Feedback is optional, although encouraged, as it allows US Identify to better address our users’ needs and continuously work towards improving our products and services.  By submitting your Feedback, you acknowledge and agree that (1) such Feedback does not contain confidential or proprietary information; (2) US Identify shall be entitled to use or disclose (or choose not to disclose) any such Feedback for any purpose, in any way, in any media worldwide; (3) you irrevocably assign to US Identify all rights to your Feedback; (4) US Identify is not under any obligation of confidentiality, express or implied, with respect to the Feedback; and (5) you are not entitled to any compensation or reimbursement of any kind from US Identify under any circumstances for submission of your Feedback.</p>
<p><b>Billing Information.</b>  While many products and services on our Site are provided free, some require payment from you by credit/debit card (“Billing Information”).  We collect, and if you are purchasing a recurring billing subscription, we store Billing Information but this information is only shared with third parties who perform tasks required to verify and complete the purchase transaction.  Examples of this include fulfilling orders and processing credit/debit cards.  </p>
<p><b>User Generated Content.</b>  The Services may contain review or chat areas and/or other message, communication or other mechanisms designed to enable you to communicate with others or to post content on the Site (the “Communication Services”).  Please remember that any information you disclose while participating with the Communication Services becomes public information, becomes the property of, and is subject to redistribution by, US Identify.  You should exercise caution and discretion when deciding to disclose your personal information in a submission or posting.  There is no expectation of privacy when playing, posting, or otherwise participating on the Communication Services.  If you post content, please be aware that any personally identifiable information contained in such content is accessible to registered users or visitors to that US Identify Application or Communication Service and we have no control over how those users may use your personally identifiable information.  We have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor any activity and content associated with the Communication Services.  We reserve the right to take action in connection with any content we deem to be inappropriate.  Please review our Terms of Use for more information regarding your appropriate use of these Communication Services.</p>
<p><b>Job Applicants.</b>  If your personal information is submitted through our Site when applying for a position with our company, the information will be used solely in connection with considering and acting upon your application.  We may retain your personal information for a period of time, but only for the purpose of considering your application for current or future available positions.  This information may be shared with our partners and affiliates for the purpose of evaluating your qualifications for the particular position or other available positions, as well as with third-party service providers retained by us to collect, maintain and analyze candidate submissions for job postings.</p>

<p><b><u>Information Collected Through Technology and Advertising </u></b></p>
<p>In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the US Identify Applications (“Usage Information”), including the device used to access US Identify Applications (“Device”), and the IP address or other unique identifier identified by that Device (“Device Identifier”).  Your Device Identifier may also identify your regional location.  This Usage Information is used for many purposes including, for example, to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Provide useful features to simplify your experience when you return to US Identify Applications; for example, remembering the searches you conducted</li>
<li>Deliver relevant content based on your preferences, usage patterns and location </li>
<li>Monitor and evaluate the use and operation of our US Identify Applications </li>
<li>Analyze traffic on our US Identify Applications and on the sites and applications of third parties </li>
<li>We may associate this tracking data with your registration account, in which case we will treat it as personal information.  </li>
</ul>

<p>Third party service providers might combine information they collect from your interaction with US Identify Applications with personal information they collect from other sources.  We do not have access to, nor control over, third parties' use of tracking technologies.  Service providers that collect tracking data on our behalf may provide an opportunity for you to choose not to be tracked online. If you choose to disable cookies on your Device, some features of the US Identify Applications may not function properly.  For instance, if cookies are disabled, you will not be able to log into our US Identify Applications. </p>

<p><b><u>Information You Provide About a Third Party </u></b></p>

<p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our Services, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.  We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit USIdentify.com.  We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and for tracking the success of our referral program.  Your friend may e-mail us by using our contact form located at <a href="http://www.USIdentify.com/company/contact.html">http://www.USIdentify.com/company/contact.html</a> to request that we remove this information from our database.  If that person registers with us, his/her information will be treated in the same manner as all other customers or registered users.  Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on the US Identify Applications, your e-mail address may be included in the communication sent to your friend.</p>

<p><b><u>Information We Collect From Third Parties</u></b></p>
We acquire information from other trusted sources to update or supplement the information you provided or we collected automatically, such as information to validate or update your address, your billing information, or other demographic and lifestyle information.  We use this information to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect, to target our communications so that we can inform you of products, services and offers that may be of interest, and for internal business analysis or other business purposes.

<p><b><u>Advertising</u></b></p>

<p>Advertisers and third parties also may collect information about your activity on US Identify Applications and on third-party sites and applications using tracking technologies.  Tracking data collected by these advertisers and third parties is used to decide which ads you see both on our US Identify Applications and on third-party sites and applications, but does not identify you personally and is not associated with your registration account.  We do not have access to or control over information that may be collected by advertisers and third parties, but many ad networks, data exchanges, marketing analytics and other service providers may allow you to choose not to receive their targeted advertising.  We adhere to the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.</p>
<p><b>II.  HOW WE USE AND SHARE YOUR INFORMATION</b></p>

<p><b>Use of Information by Us.</b>  We may use Information that we collect about you: (1) to provide you with information or process transactions that you have requested or agreed to receive; (2) to provide you with information regarding new features, products or services; (3) to improve the US Identify Applications or our Services and to customize your experience; (4) to contact you with regard to your use of the US Identify Applications and, in our discretion, changes to the US Identify Applications and/or the US Identify Applications’ policies; (5) for internal business purposes; (6) for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your information, and (7) as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.  </p>
<p><b>Contacting You.</b>  When you provide us with information in connection with a particular activity or otherwise sign up for our Services or provide your contact information, including an email address or telephone number in connection with that activity, product or service, you agree that this action constitutes a purchase or inquiry establishing a business relationship with us. You expressly consent to our communicating with you about US Identify using the information you provided to us.  You also attest that you have the legal authority over any telephone number you provide to us and can provide us with the authorization to contact you.  This means you may be contacted in person or by recorded message, by e-mail, telephone and/or mobile telephone number (including use of automated dialing equipment), text (SMS) message, or any other means of communication that your wireless or other telecommunications device may be capable of receiving.</p>
<p><b>Transactional Communications.</b>  We may send you notices from time to time relating to your account or your orders.  These may include order confirmations, invoices or customer service notifications.  We may also send you service-related announcements when it is necessary to do so; for instance, if our Service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, or the delivery of a product is delayed or there is some service issue with something you may have ordered.  You may not opt-out of receiving these communications, which are not promotional in nature.</p>
<p><b>Service Providers.</b>  We may use third party service providers to help us operate our business and the US Identify Applications or administer activities on our behalf.  We may share your information with these third parties for those limited purposes. </p>
<p><b>Electronic Promotional Offers.</b>  We may send you promotional emails regarding special offers about our Services.  You may choose not to receive our promotional communications by clicking the unsubscribe link in the footer of any email. After unsubscribing or closing your account, we cannot guarantee that you will never receive another marketing mailing from us, because we may obtain your e-mail address in the future through a different e-mail marketing program that you have opted into.  Unsubscribing from one marketing list will not automatically unsubscribe a user from all marketing lists. Please note that even if you opt out of receiving promotional e-mails, we may continue to send you electronic service or transactional notifications that are related to your account(s), orders or other services you have requested, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.  </p>
<p><b>Co-branded Areas. </b> Certain areas on our US Identify Applications may be provided to you in association with third parties such as sponsors or advertisers which provide products and or services, (“Co-Branded Areas”).  Such Co-Branded Areas will identify the third party.  If you elect to register for the products and/or services provided at these Co-Branded Areas, you either will be providing your Personal Information to both us and the third party or we might be providing your Personal Information directly to the third party in order for that third party to fulfill their products and services directly with you.  Your Personal Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy as well as the privacy policy and practices of such third party.  We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those third parties and we suggest you review the individual privacy policies of each company with whom you establish a relationship.  You should consult the respective privacy policies of those third party sponsors or advertisers to learn more about their privacy practices.</p>
<p><b>Legal Matters; Safety.</b>  We may, without your consent, access and disclose your information, any communications sent or received by you (including, without limitation, the contents of any chat, messaging, or other communication posted in the Communication Services), and any other information that we may have about you or your account as may be permitted or required by law (including, but not limited to, court order or subpoena), or to prevent or investigate suspected fraud, violations of our Terms of Use or activity that appears to us to be illegal or may expose us to legal liability. Additionally, we may disclose your information and/or communications in situations that we believe to be: (i) emergencies involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person or property if we believe that your information in any way relates to that threat; or (ii) your conduct on the US Identify Applications or when using the Communication Services that we believe is inappropriate and inconsistent with generally accepted norms of behavior.</p>
<p><b>Sale or Transfer of Business or Assets.</b> In the event that we, or any of our businesses, are sold or disposed of as a going concern, whether by merger, sale of assets or otherwise, or in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership, personally identifiable information of our customers and visitors to our US Identify Applications may be one of the assets sold or merged in connection with that transaction.  Information about our customers and registered users may also need to be disclosed in connection with a commercial transaction where we or any one of our businesses are seeking financing, investment, support or funding.  In such transactions, Personal Information will be subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy in effect when the information was obtained.</p>


<p><b>III.  ACCESS TO YOUR INFORMATION</b></p>
<p>If for any reason you are concerned that the Personal Information or Billing Information you provided to us is not correct and you wish to change it, you have the ability to review and update your personal information online by logging into your account, <a href="https://www.USIdentify.com/login">https://www.USIdentify.com/login</a>.

Despite this, we will endeavor to comply with any such requests to block the records we have control over as described above.  Please note, we have no control over public records, and do not guarantee or warrant that a request for removal of or change to personally identifiable information as described above will result in removal of or change to all of your information from USIdentify.com.
