Submitting information is strictly voluntary. By doing so, you are giving USIP your permission to use the information for the intended purpose. If you do not want to give USIP permission to use your information, simply do not provide it. However, not providing certain information may result in USIP's inability to provide you with the information or services you desire. 

We never collect information for commercial marketing purposes.

### Information collected and stored automatically

We collect and temporarily store certain technical information about your visit for use in site management and security purposes. This information includes:

### Information from children

In general, this website is not intended for use by persons under 13 years of age unless they have a parent or guardians' permission. We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from or about children, other than that detailed in the previous sections that is automatically collected on every visitor unless you choose to provide information to us. We provide many on-line tools and services in support of our mission. A child under 13 years old may inadvertently provide personal information to one of these services. If this should happen, the information about the child will be deleted immediately upon discovery.

### Cookies

A cookie is a small file that a website transfers to your computer to allow it to remember specific information about your session while you are connected. Your computer will only share the information in the cookie with the website that provided it, and no other website can request it. There are two types of cookies, session and persistent.
