card information is stored on our servers. U.S. Immigration Support uses Authorize.net to process credit card transactions. Authorize.net is a leading

other reason. For statistical purposes we have installed Google Analytics. Visit our <a href="certifications.html">Business and Website Certifications</a> section for more information.

<b>Use of Your Data</b><br>
The information you voluntarily provide to us is only used to process your order. User data is never disclosed to any third parties unless as otherwise disclosed in this privacy statement.

<b>Security</b><br>
Our shopping cart includes a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificate to protect 
our customers’ information when shopping online. SSL technology encrypts the 
customers’ name, address, and credit card information between your computer and 
our server. We work closely with Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover 
to eliminate any fraudulent transactions. It is easy to see that your connection 
is secure as the URL of your website will change from http:// to https:// 
indicating that the connection is secure during the check-out process. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal 
information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No 
method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 
100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable 
means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute 
security.
<br>
<br>

<b>Changes in this Privacy Statement</b><br>
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this 
privacy statement, the home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that 
you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what 
circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please 
review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify 
you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.
