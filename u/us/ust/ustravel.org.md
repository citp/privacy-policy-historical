**Browsing**

When You browse our Sites, We do not collect Personal Information, unless You voluntarily provide it to us.

When We need to collect Personal Information from You to provide You with a particular service, We will ask You to voluntarily supply Us with the information We need, as explained below.

**General Information Collected**

To monitor site usage and improve the quality of our Sites, We gather general information about the use of our Sites. We use web server logs and industry-standard website statistics software to count the number of users who visit our Sites and to count the number of views of particular pages, as well as to track other general statistics about our Sites. We do not track individual users' visits to our Sites. At times U.S. Travel may share with third parties aggregate, anonymous information about overall usage of our Sites and other Internet services that We collect, to provide general information about our Internet services, sell advertising, or establish sponsorships or other business relationships.

More information on Members is detailed below. Non-members visitors will need to create an account to generate a unique login and password. Information collected from non-members may include your name, address, telephone and fax numbers, email address, and credit card number or other payment information. More information about account information can be found in the Terms of Use.

We will not store or distribute your payment information in a manner that is not necessary for processing a transaction.

**Members' Information**

U.S. Travel offers members certain services through the restricted-access “Members Only” section of our Sites. In the Members Only section, members can access and update their Member Profiles, which include Personal Information We have collected from each member as part of their membership application. Member Profiles are maintained for the Main and Associate member contacts in our main membership database. This information includes information such as member ID number, name, firm/organization, address, telephone and fax numbers, and email address.

The Member Profiles are used by U.S. Travel to distribute certain marketing materials by mail, fax or email. If You are a member and wish to elect not to be included in any of these communications, You may opt-out using the methods listed below.

**Information Collected to Access Certain Private Sections**

U.S. Travel collects a password for each member who uses the online Members Section of the Sites, or the event attendees section of certain of our Sites. This information is used to verify Your identity in order to prevent unauthorized access to these section and Your Personal Information. Only a small number of U.S. Travel employees and employees at our third-party software vendors have access to this information. It is accessed only when necessary to provide members with online account-related information, provide technical support, or diagnose or repair problems with the Members Only or Attendees sections. You may update your Personal Information if You have registered at the Sites by emailing Us at [feedback@ustravel.org](mailto:feedback@ustravel.org) from your email address on record or, if You have access to the Members Only section of the Sites, by editing your profile within that section. We may not be able to update any information previously disclosed to a third party. Your Personal Information is necessary in order for Us to send You newsletters or other communications or to provide You access to the Members Only section of the Sites. Therefore, if You delete such necessary information We may not be able to provide You certain Services.

The safety and security of Your information also depends on You. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Sites, You are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask You not to share Your password with anyone.

**Emails/Newsletters**

It is our intention to only send You email communications that You want to receive. When You provide Us with your email address by creating a login account, We will periodically contact You via email about U.S. Travel programs and services. Every time You receive an email, You will be provided the choice to opt-out of future emails by following the instructions provided in the email. You may also opt-out by emailing [ **feedback@ustravel.org**](mailto:feedback@ustravel.org) or sending a letter to:

**Cookies and Pixel Tags**

Our Sites use “Cookie” technology. “Cookies” are encrypted strings of text that a website stores on a user's computer. Our Sites require the use of a “Session” Cookie when accessing the online traveler community. “Session” Cookies are temporary and are automatically deleted once You close your internet browser. Session Cookies allow You to log-in and then view and update your content throughout the Sites during the same session or visit. Our Sites use a “Persistent” Cookie to direct You to the correct country/language version of our Sites for subsequent visits. Persistent Cookies remain on your computer until You delete them or are otherwise removed upon expiration. We do not use Cookies to ascertain any personally identifiable information about You apart from what You voluntarily provide us. Cookies do not corrupt or damage your computer, programs, or computer files. Most browsers have an option to reject or disable cookies, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing You to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. Although You can block cookies and similar technology, your experience of the Sites and Services could be affected by doing so.

Pixel tags are not visible to the user of the Sites and consist of a few lines of computer code. Pixel tags are not used to collect any personally identifiable information about you. Our Sites use pixel tags to track the aggregate number of page views made on our Sites by all Sites visitors. We also use social media pixels in compliance with the policies of the various social media sites, such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, to track cookies. These pixels allow social media sites to track visitors to outside websites in order to tailor the advertising messages that users see while visiting that social media website. Our email service provider uses pixel tags to determine your ability to receive HTML-based email messages. This capability helps our service provider send email in a format You can read. The sensor does not collect or use any other information. Pixel tags also allow Us to know how many users open an email and allow our service provider to compile aggregated statistics about an email campaign for us.

**Promotions**

We have strategic marketing relationships with select third party organizations (e.g., American Express) to offer certain travel related products and services at discounted prices. As part of the purchase process for these products and services You will be required to provide Personal Information such as your name, address, email address, telephone number and credit card information. This information will be used by Us and will be provided to the associated third party organizations (e.g., hotel, credit card processor) to execute the transaction. As part of these promotions You will also be given a choice to opt-in into periodic emails from U.S. Travel and the organizations We have selected to offer promotions so that We can keep You informed of future offers and promotions that may be of interest. Please note that there are specific terms and conditions that will be unique to each promotion. An example is the requirement to be a member of the loyalty program for a hotel brand that is included in the promotion. You should carefully review the terms and conditions associated with each promotion before making a purchase.

**Securing Your Information**

The Personal Information You provide is encrypted and sent to Us using a secure method. We treat personal information You provide as confidential information, and We use commercially reasonable security measures to protect personal information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction. After Personal Information reaches U.S. Travel, it is stored on a secure server that resides behind firewalls designed to block unauthorized access.

However, please understand that no one can provide an absolute guarantee that information intended to be maintained as private, whether transmitted via the Internet or otherwise, cannot be accessed inappropriately or unlawfully by third parties. We have taken and will continue to take reasonable steps to ensure the secure and safe transmission of your personal information. You understand and agree that such steps do not guarantee that use of the Sites is invulnerable to all security breaches, and that U.S. Travel makes no warranty, guarantee, or representation that use of any portion of our Sites is protected from viruses, security threats or other vulnerabilities.
