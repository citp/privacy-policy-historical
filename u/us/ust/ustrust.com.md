At U.S. Trust Corporation (U.S. Trust), our most important asset is our relationship with you. We are honored that you have entrusted us with your financial affairs, and we are committed to safeguarding the privacy of information we maintain about you. Establishing and adhering to an effective privacy policy is an important part of that dedication. 

Below, you will find details about U.S. Trust's commitment to protecting your privacy, including the types of information we collect about you, how we use and share that information both within and outside the U.S. Trust family of companies, and how you can instruct us to limit certain types of information sharing.

Our privacy policy applies to all clients with whom we have a relationship and is also extended to each of our former clients.

Your Privacy is Not for Sale   
Simply put, we do not and will not sell your personal information to anyone, for any reason, at any time. 

How We Collect Information About You   
We collect personal information about you in a number of ways. 

  * **Application and registration information.** We collect information from you when you open an account or register for one of our services, such as our client web site, or use one of our wealth consulting services, such as financial or estate planning. We may also collect information from consumer reporting agencies to verify your identity in the account-opening process or if you apply for any type of lending arrangement. The information we collect may include your name, address, phone number, email address, Social Security number, and date of birth, as well as details about your interests, investments, and investment experience. 
  * **Transaction and experience information.** Once you have opened an account with us, we collect and maintain personal information about your account activity, including your transactions, balances, positions, and history. This information allows us to administer your account and provide the services you have requested. 
  * **Third-party information providers.** We may collect information about you from information services and consumer reporting agencies to verify your identity, employment, or creditworthiness, or to better understand your financial needs. 
  * **W** **eb site usage.** When you visit our web site, our computer may use devices known as “cookies,” graphic interchange format files (GIFs), or other similar web tools to enhance your web experience. These tools enable us to recognize you when you return to our site, and to maintain your web session while you browse throughout the site, as well as help us provide you with a better, more personalized experience. Cookies do not, standing alone, identify you as an individual by name or account number; they merely recognize your browser. 



How We Share Information About You Within the U.S. Trust Family of Companies   
The U.S. Trust family of companies consists of a number of banking, brokerage, investment advisory, and related companies (often referred to as “affiliates”), such as United States Trust Company of New York, U.S. Trust Company, N.A. and UST Securities Corporation. 

Many clients do business or have relationships with more than one U.S. Trust affiliate, creating an efficient, comprehensive wealth management relationship to meet individual client needs. We share client information among U.S. Trust affiliates to:

  * Make it easy for you to interact with us, even if you are traveling and away from your local U.S. Trust office; and 
  * Help provide you with better service or perform services on your behalf. 



You may instruct us not to share information about you with other U.S. Trust affiliates for certain purposes, as explained under “How to Limit the Sharing of Information About You.” 

How We Share Information About You Outside of the U.S. Trust Family of Companies   
U.S. Trust provides access to information about you to outside companies and other third parties in certain limited circumstances, including: 

  * To help us process transactions for your account; 
  * When we use another company to provide services for us, such as printing and mailing your account statements; and 
  * When we believe that disclosure is required or permitted under law. For example, we may be required to disclose personal information to cooperate with regulatory or law enforcement authorities, to resolve consumer disputes, to perform credit/authentication checks, or for risk control. 



U.S. Trust is part of The Charles Schwab family of financial services companies that are owned by our parent, The Charles Schwab Corporation. U.S. Trust does not share information about you with these companies for marketing purposes, unless you express interest in specific products or services and instruct us to do so. 

How to Limit the Sharing of Information About You   
If you prefer, you may choose to limit the information we share about you with other U.S. Trust affiliates. Specifically, you may instruct us:

  * Not to share with our affiliates consumer reports and other personal information about you that may be used to determine your eligibility for credit (for example, information about your income, profession, or employment status); 
  * You may exercise this choice by contacting your client relationship officer; 
  * Your choice will be applied to you as an individual and will automatically be extended to all of your accounts with us, as well as any accounts you may have with any other U.S. Trust affiliate with whom you have a relationship. If you have an account at another company within The Charles Schwab Corporation, you will receive a separate privacy notice from them which will tell you how they share information about you and how you can limit their ability to do so; 
  * Joint account holders may instruct us on behalf of another account holder; and 
  * You may make your privacy choice at any time and it will remain in effect until you change it. 



If you choose to limit these types of information sharing, we may continue to share information that identifies you (such as your name and Social Security number), with our affiliates, as well as information about your transactions and experiences with us. In addition, our affiliates may continue to use information they receive from us to perform services on our behalf, to respond to communications from you, as you authorize or request, or, if you are their client, to offer you products or services. We may also continue to share information about you with outside companies as permitted or required by law. 

State Laws   
We will comply with state laws that apply to the disclosure or use of information about you. For example, if your address is in Vermont, we will automatically limit information sharing as described in “How to Limit the Sharing of Information About You” without your having to advise us of this privacy choice. 

Safeguarding Your Information, Maintaining Your Trust   
We take precautions to ensure the information we collect about you is protected and is accessed only by authorized individuals or organizations.

Companies we use to provide support services are not allowed to use information about our clients for their own purposes and are contractually obligated to maintain strict confidentiality. We limit their use of information to the performance of the specific services we have requested.

We restrict access to personal information by our employees and agents. Our employees are trained about privacy and are required to safeguard personal information.

We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect non-public personal information.

  Teaming Up Against Identity Theft   
Identity theft is a serious concern for all of us. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is our priority. U.S. Trust takes steps to protect you from identity theft by:

  * Utilizing client identification and authentication procedures before initiating transactions; 
  * Creating a secure transmission connection to our U.S. Trust client web sites. You will see the padlock in the lower right corner of your browser's frame indicating it is a secure site; and 
  * Ensuring our employees are trained to safeguard personal information about you. 



You can also help protect your identity and accounts. Here are a few steps to remember: 

  * U.S. Trust will never request your account number, login password, or Social Security number in either a non-secure or unsolicited email communication; 
  * Shred documents that contain personal information; 
  * Check your credit report regularly for unauthorized activity and protect your personal identification numbers (PINs) or personal data. 



Greater Accuracy Means Better Protection   
We are committed to keeping accurate, up-to-date records to help ensure the integrity of the information we maintain about you. If you identify an inaccuracy in this information, or you need to make a change to it, please contact your client relationship officer. 

A Commitment to Keeping You Informed   
We will provide you with advance notice of important changes to our information-sharing practices. 

How U. S. Trust Protects Your Identity   
Your privacy is our priority and U. S. Trust is committed to protecting you 

  * We do not sell customer information to anyone. 
  * We use encryption technology to protect sensitive information that is transmitted over the Internet. 
  * We control access to your information inside our company by limiting employee access to systems and data. 
  * We ensure all employees are trained to safeguard your information. 
  * We continue to evaluate our efforts to protect personal information and make every effort to keep your personal information secure. 



Our most important asset is our relationship with you. We understand that you have entrusted us with your private financial information, and we do everything we can to maintain that trust. 

How You Can Protect Your Identity and Accounts   
Identity theft occurs when someone uses your personal information such as your name, Social Security number, credit card number or other identifying information, without your permission to commit fraud or other crimes. 

Identity theft is a serious concern. Here are some steps to remember in order to protect your identity and accounts. 

  * U. S. Trust will never request or disclose your personal information (account number, Login password, Social Security number) in either a non-secure or unsolicited email communication. 
  * If you get an email that warns you, with little or no notice, that an account of yours will be shut down unless you reconfirm your billing information, do not reply or click on the link in the email. 
  * When you enter account or personal information at the U. S. Trust Website, it will always be over a secure connection. You can be sure of this because you will see the secure site indicator in the lower right corner of your browser's frame in the shape of a padlock. It signals that your information is secure during transmission. 
  * Shred financial documents that contain your personal information before you discard. 
  * Check your credit report regularly to make sure no unauthorized activity has occurred. 
  * Protect your personal information (such as your PIN, Social Security number, date of birth, etc.). Do not give it out to any person or company or in an email unless you are familiar with them and you have initiated your communication with them. 
  * Don't carry unneeded credit cards, your Social Security card, your birth certificate or other personal documents in your purse or wallet. 
  * Monitor all your bank statements from credit card companies every month. Check to see if there is anything that you do not recognize and call the credit grantor to verify that it is truly yours. 



It's also important to protect your computer at home. Here are few best practices to follow: 

  * Use and update anti-virus software which will not only protect your machine from malicious viruses, but also helps to protect the networks to which you connect. 
  * Use a firewall to protect the data on your computer from users entering your computer. 
  * Do not re-use passwords for sensitive systems. 



Again, the protection of your account and personal information is very important to U. S. Trust.

  * **Report the identity theft and request a "fraud alert."** This ensures that you will be contacted before any new account is opened and/or an existing account is changed.   

  * **Request copies of credit reports.** Review the reports carefully and identify any new accounts that may have been opened. Pay particular attention to the section of the report that lists "inquiries" from new companies. Contact these companies immediately and have them remove any pending or new accounts from their system. **Note: Credit bureaus must provide free copies of credit reports to victims of identity theft.  
**
  * **Contact the fraud departments of creditors to dispute unauthorized charges** (e.g., credit card issuer, phone companies, utilities, banks, other lenders.) Describe your identity theft problem and follow up with a letter.   

  * **Contact your local police department and ask to file a report**. This may help when clearing your credit.   

  * **File a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).** The FTC handles complaints from victims of identity theft, provides information to those victims, and refers complaints to appropriate entities, including the major credit-reporting agencies and law enforcement agencies.   

  * **By phone:** **877-ID-THEFT**
