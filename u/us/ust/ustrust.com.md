The U.S. Tust Privacy Policy

At U.S. Trust Corporation (U.S. Trust), our most important asset is our relationship with you. We are honored that you have entrusted us with your financial affairs, and we are committed to safeguarding the privacy of information we maintain about you. Establishing and adhering to an effective privacy policy is an important part of that dedication. 

Below, you will find details about U.S. Trust's commitment to protecting your privacy, including the types of information we collect about you, how we use and share that information both within and outside the U.S. Trust family of companies, and how you can instruct us to limit certain types of information sharing.

Our privacy policy applies to all clients with whom we have a relationship and is also extended to each of our former clients.

Your Privacy is Not for Sale   
Simply put, we do not and will not sell your personal information to anyone, for any reason, at any time. 

How We Collect Information About You   
We collect personal information about you in a number of ways. 

  * **Application and registration information.** We collect information from you when you open an account or register for one of our services, such as our client web site, or use one of our wealth consulting services, such as financial or estate planning. We may also collect information from consumer reporting agencies to verify your identity in the account-opening process or if you apply for any type of lending arrangement. The information we collect may include your name, address, phone number, email address, Social Security number, and date of birth, as well as details about your interests, investments, and investment experience. 
  * **Transaction and experience information.** Once you have opened an account with us, we collect and maintain personal information about your account activity, including your transactions, balances, account positions, and account history. This information allows us to administer your account and provide the services you have requested. 
  * **Third-party information providers.** We may collect information about you from information services and consumer reporting agencies to verify your identity, employment, or creditworthiness, or to better understand your financial needs. 
  * **W** **ebsite usage.** When you visit our website, our computer may use devices known as “cookies,” graphic interchange format files (GIFs), or other similar web tools to enhance your web experience. These tools enable us to recognize you when you return to our site, and to maintain your web session while you browse, as well as help us provide you with a better, more personalized experience at U.S. Trust.

How We Share Information About You Within the U.S. Trust Family  
of Companies   
The U.S. Trust family of companies consists of a number of banking, brokerage, investment advisory, and related companies (often referred to as "affiliates"), such as United States Trust Company, National Association and UST Securities Corp. 

Many clients do business or have relationships with more than one U.S. Trust affiliate, creating an efficient, comprehensive wealth management relationship to meet individual client needs. We share client information among U.S. Trust affiliates to:

  * Make it easy for you to interact with us, even if you are traveling and away from your local U.S. Trust office; and 
  * Help provide you with better service or perform services on your behalf. 



You may instruct us not to share information about you with other U.S. Trust affiliates for certain purposes, as explained under "How to Limit the Sharing of Information About You". 

How We Share Information About You Outside of the U.S. Trust Family   
of Companies   
U.S. Trust provides access to information about you to outside companies and other third parties in certain limited circumstances, including: 

  * To help us process transactions for your account; 
  * When we use another company to provide services for us, such as printing and mailing your account statements; and 
  * When we believe that disclosure is required or permitted under law. For example, we may be required to disclose personal information to cooperate with regulatory or law enforcement authorities, to resolve consumer disputes, to perform credit/authentication checks, or for risk control. 



U.S. Trust is part of The Charles Schwab family of financial services companies that are owned by our parent, The Charles Schwab Corporation. U.S. Trust does not share information about you with these companies for marketing purposes, unless you express interest in specific products or services, and instruct us to do so. 

How to Limit the Sharing of Information About You   
If you prefer, you may choose to limit the information we share about you with other U.S. Trust affiliates. Specifically:

  * You may instruct us not to share with our affiliates consumer reports and other personal information about you that may be used to determine your eligibility for credit (for example, information about your income, profession, or employment status); 
  * You may exercise this choice by contacting your client relationship officer; 
  * Your choice will be applied to you as an individual and will automatically be extended to all of your accounts with us, as well as any accounts you may have with any other U.S. Trust affiliate with whom you have a relationship. If you have an account at another company within The Charles Schwab Corporation, you will receive a separate privacy notice from it which will tell you how it shares information about you and how you can limit its ability to do so; 
  * Joint account holders may instruct us on behalf of another account holder; and 
  * You may make your privacy choice at any time and it will remain in effect until you change it. 



If you choose to limit these types of information sharing, we may continue to share information with our affiliates that identifies you (such as your name and Social Security number), as well as information about your transactions and experiences with us. In addition, our affiliates may continue to use information they receive from us to perform services on our behalf, to respond to communications from you, as you authorize or request, or if you are their customer, to offer you products or services. We may also continue to share information about you with outside companies as permitted or required by law. 

State Laws   
We will comply with state laws that apply to the disclosure or use of information about you. For example, if your address is in Vermont, we will automatically limit information sharing as described in “How to Limit the Sharing of Information About You” without your having to advise us of this privacy choice. 

The following notice is required to be made under Nevada law to all clients with a Nevada mailing address. At any time, you may request to be placed on our internal "do not call" list. You may do so by calling or emailing your client relationship officer or mailing your request to the Privacy Officer, United States Trust Company, N.A., 114 West 47th Street, New York, NY 10036. Clients from any state may also request to be placed on U.S. Trust's "do not call" list by calling or emailing their client relationship officer or mailing their request to the Privacy Officer at the above address. For more information about the Nevada "do not call" notice requirement, you may also contact the Nevada Attorney General, 555 Washington Street, Suite 3900, Las Vegas, NV 89101; Phone: 702-486-3132; Email: BCPINFO@ag.state.nv.us.

Safeguarding Your Information, Maintaining Your Trust   
We take precautions to ensure the information we collect about you is protected and is accessed only by authorized individuals or organizations.

Companies we use to provide support services are not allowed to use information about our clients for their own purposes and are contractually obligated to maintain strict confidentiality. We limit their use of information to the performance of the specific services we have requested.

We restrict access to personal information by our employees and agents. Our employees are trained about privacy and are required to safeguard personal information.

We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect non-public personal information.

  Teaming Up Against Identity Theft   
Identity theft is a serious concern for all of us. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is our priority. U.S. Trust takes steps to protect you from identity theft by:

  * Utilizing client identification and authentication procedures before initiating transactions; 
  * Creating a secure transmission connection to our U.S. Trust websites. You will see the padlock in the lower right corner of your browser's frame indicating it is a secure site; and 
  * Ensuring our employees are trained to safeguard personal information about you. 



You can also help protect your identity and accounts. Here are a few steps to remember: 

  * U.S. Trust will never request your account number, login password, or Social Security number in either a non-secure or unsolicited email communication; 
  * Shred documents that contain personal information; and 
  * Check your credit report regularly for unauthorized activity and protect your personal identification numbers (PINs) or personal data.

Greater Accuracy Means Better Protection   
We are committed to keeping accurate, up-to-date records to help ensure the integrity of the information we maintain about you. If you identify an inaccuracy in this information, or you need to make a change to it, please contact your client relationship officer. 

A Commitment to Keeping You Informed   
We will provide you with advance notice of important changes to our information-sharing practices.

Online Privacy and Information Security  


If you have a security-related concern, please call us at **1-800-USTRUST**. We will work closely with you to ensure a rapid response to your concerns. 

U.S. Trust understands that you have entrusted us with personal information that is both important and confidential. We take our responsibility to protect your information extremely seriously. 

U.S. Trust updates its security and privacy standards to guard against identity theft and provide security for your account information. We constantly re-evaluate our security and privacy policies and adapt them as necessary to deal with new challenges. 

U.S. Trust’s account protection efforts fall into, but are not limited to, these categories: 

  1. **Authentication – Secure identification and authentication before initiating transactions  
**We maintain strict rules for the creation of Login IDs and passwords, designed to stop others from guessing your log-in information.  **more**
  2. **Web Site Security – Secure transmission connection to our U.S. Trust Web sites**  
We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology and encrypted “cookies” to establish and maintain a secure transmission connection and encrypt data passing between your computer and our systems. This is designed to prevent anyone from intercepting or viewing your personal information.  **more**  
  3. **Email Security – Policies to fight “phishing” and other email-related security challenges  
**U.S. Trust is constantly reassessing its email security and log-in standards to provide protection against new and changing security challenges.   **more**
  4. ****Transaction Monitoring, Employee Oversight and Access Control –** **Watching for unusual account behavior**** **  
** We have highly sophisticated internal transaction monitoring systems in place to identify potentially suspicious and fraudulent activities. These systems are combined with strict controls on employee access to account information, creating a further layer of protection for your information.  **more**
  5. **Employee Training**  
U.S. Trust employees are trained to safeguard your personal information.  **more**
  6. **Steps You Should Take**  
You play an important role in safeguarding your personal information and protecting your privacy. Here are some of the things you can do.  **more**  
  7. **The U.S. Trust Security Guarantee  
**Information on our security efforts can be found above.  **more **



Authentication   


Authentication is the process that our clients go through to access secure areas of our Web site. This process takes place when you log into your account. The two key components of log-in are your Login ID and Password. 

Login ID:  Upon receipt of a request from you and appropriate validation, U.S. Trust will designate a Login ID for you. We do not use any combination of SSN or birth date as part of your Login ID. 

Passwords:  We maintain strict rules to help prevent others from guessing your password and recommend that you change your password periodically. While password parameters vary slightly by application, in general, your password must meet the following criteria: 

  * A system-designated minimum character length 
  * Include both letters and numbers 



In addition, for your protection, repeated unsuccessful attempts to log in will cause your online access to be disabled. Once this happens, your password must be reset. If this happens to you inadvertently, please call the U.S. Trust help desk at 1-800-USTRUST or your relationship officer to have your password reset. 

**Return to top**

Web Site Security 

From the time you submit your Login ID and Password, communications between your computer and U.S. Trust are encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL3) technology, a secure communication protocol that protects your privacy. SSL enables client and server applications to communicate in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering and message forgery. 

To support this technology, you need a recent version of an SSL3-capable, 128-bit browser, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or AOL. These browsers will activate SSL3 automatically whenever you sign on to your U.S. Trust account. 

Look for the padlock! To ensure that SSL encryption is protecting your private communications, look for a small picture of a padlock on the browser frame. Another indicator is the URL prefix “HTTPS.” See below. 

If you move the cursor over the “locked padlock” icon, a pop-up message will appear stating “SSL Secured (128 Bit).” Absence of the pop-up message may indicate that you are connected to a “phishing” site. 

Another important information security measure in place throughout U.S. Trust’s web sites is the timeout feature. This feature will log you out of your account, if there has been no activity within a specified amount of time. It is designed to stop others from accessing your account, if you fail to log out. 

  


We have implemented these measures for your protection, but you should still remember to log out each time you have finished accessing your U.S. Trust accounts. 

**Cookies:**  
Cookies enable us to understand better how you and others use U.S. Trust’s online channels. They allow us to collect information about where your browser goes on our Web sites. This assists us in understanding your preferences and improving our Web site. For example, the information we obtain from cookies or Graphical Interchange Formats helps us understand whether our customers use certain Web features and how to improve navigation. Knowing where your browser has been on our Web site helps us present useful information and offers to you. We do not sell this or any other information about you to other Web sites, merchants or financial institutions. 

Cookies come in two types: persistent and session-based. U.S. Trust uses session cookies. 

Session cookies exist only during an online session with U.S. Trust.  They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Session cookies allow you to conduct transactions or request your own personal or account information on our Web site. They contain encrypted or encoded information about your account(s), and/or identifying information that you have previously provided to us. This information allows U.S. Trust to process your online transactions and requests.

Email Security 

Recently there has been rapid growth in email-related information security challenges such as “phishing” or “spoofing” schemes. These fraudulent techniques attempt to fool you into giving up your personal data by impersonating legitimate communications from financial service providers. We are working with other financial institutions and technology leaders to prevent these security challenges from impacting our clients. Measures currently in place or underway include: 

  * Implementation of domain-verification technologies that, in cooperation with Internet service providers, will enable clients to verify that emails claiming to have come from U.S. Trust actually did come from U.S. Trust. 
  * Standardization of U.S. Trust emails and adherence to industry anti-phishing best practices. We continually re-design our email policies to incorporate the latest tools and standards aimed at preventing phishing. 
  * Ongoing assessment and implementation of new log-in technologies designed to prevent others from masquerading as our Web site.

**  


Transaction Monitoring, Employee Oversight   
and Access Control

We use automated transactional monitoring tools to detect suspicious account activity. When these sophisticated systems flag a questionable transaction, we validate that the transaction is legitimate and that it will be processed safely and rapidly. This combination of automated and manual transaction monitoring further strengthens the security we provide for your financial and personal information. 

**Return to top  
  
**

**  
Training**  
We take precautions to ensure that your account and personal information at U.S. Trust are accessed only by employees who are authorized and monitored. This is done through access controls and training, as well as physical, electronic and procedural safeguards. Employees are trained in our notifications policy and are required to promptly report any potential breach to our swift response team. 

  * All customers are covered by our corporate Breach Notification Policy. In July, 2003, we implemented a corporate policy on breach notifications and a centralized swift response team was established. Privacy, Risk Management & Investigations, Information Security, Legal, Corporate Communications and other of our business units work together to respond to potential incidents as quickly as possible. 
  * Potential incidents are tracked, assessed and investigated. When necessary, outside law enforcement agencies become involved.

Steps You Should Take

**Client Security Practices**  
Your participation is an important component of all of our security efforts. We believe it is essential that we work in close cooperation with you as our client to maintain the highest levels of security. These are the steps you should take to protect your account: 

Protecting the security of your computer 

  * Keep your computer and browser software current with security updates. 
  * Install and update anti-virus and anti-spyware software and use personal firewalls to protect your computer. 
  * Be alert to the threats posed by malware—short for malicious software, this form of software is designed specifically to damage or disrupt a system, or to secretly record information such as keystrokes. Malware types include key logging tools, trojan horses, hijacking programs, and dialer programs that may reside on your personal computer. While these threats constantly evolve, you can help protect your personal information and computer by using a personal firewall, maintaining up-to-date anti-spyware and anti-virus programs, and by immediately reporting any suspicious activity involving your personal information. 
  * Do not enable any application features that would automatically log you into your U.S. Trust account or pre-fill the Login ID or Password fields. 
  * Change your password periodically, and avoid using passwords for U.S. Trust that you commonly use for other purposes. 
  * For more information on how to protect your personal computer, including links to vendors providing anti-virus and anti-spyware software, please visit the Federal Trade Commission’s computer security site at [**http://onguardonline.gov**](http://www.ustrust.com/redirect/?refid=P-1188387&refpid=P-453212&url=http://onguardonline.gov%20?). Microsoft Corporation provides additional information specific to the Windows operating system at [**http://www.microsoft.com/security** ](http://www.ustrust.com/redirect/?refid=P-1188237&refpid=P-453212&url=http://www.microsoft.com/security%20?). Users of Apple computers can find security information at **[http://www.apple.com/support/security](http://www.ustrust.com/redirect/?refid=P-1188238&refpid=P-453212&url=http://www.apple.com/support/security?)**. 



**Using your computer**

  * Your username and password are for your use only. Do not share them with anyone and do not write them down. 
  * Check to make sure you are interacting with a secure Web site **see above**
  * Always log off after accessing your U.S. Trust account. This prevents someone else from accessing your account if you leave your computer unattended while the session has not yet “timed out,” or automatically shut down. 
  * Be careful about using third-party computers or computers that you are not familiar with, such as those in Internet cafés. 



If you do use a third-party computer, be particularly careful to ensure you have fully logged out. U.S. Trust's systems are set to prevent browsers from saving account information in a computer’s Internet cache, but as an extra precaution you may want to clear the cache of any public computer on which you have accessed your U.S. Trust accounts. Please check the browser’s help section to learn how to manually clear its Internet cache. 

**Reading your statements**

  * Review your account statements carefully. 
  * You should only download your statements onto your own computer. Do not download them onto a **third-party computer**.



**Recognizing and fighting fraud**

  * Do not provide personal or financial information in response to an email request or by clicking on a link, unless you are able to verify the authenticity of the site to which you are taken through the SSL padlock or other means. 
  * Do not enter personal information into a form within an email message or a pop-up. 
  * Note that U.S. Trust will never ask you to provide personal financial information in an email. 
  * Do not open an email from a sender that you do not recognize. Be particularly cautious of any attachments to emails from unrecognized sources. 
  * Immediately report any unusual activity regarding your U.S. Trust accounts to our representatives at 1-800-USTRUST.

How to Protect Against Phishing 

  
What is Phishing?  


Phishing is the illegal attempt to mislead consumers into providing personal or financial information, including account numbers, passwords and Social Security numbers, via email or through fraudulent Web sites. 

The most frequent phishing attacks occur through email disguised to appear as though it came from a reputable financial institution or company. 

Most phishing attempts urge you to update or validate your account information, typically through a link in an email directing you to a fake Web site that appears to be legitimate. 

How to Spot a Phishing Attack   
There are many phishing attacks active on the Internet. Here are a few of their lines and lures: 

  * An email contains an “urgent” or “shocking” tone requesting your immediate action on an account-related matter. Phishers frequently succeed by getting consumers to act quickly without thinking. 
  * An email is sent from a user falsely claiming to be a legitimate company with an attachment. An unsolicited email attachment more than likely contains a virus. Do not open it. 
  * A pop-up window appears from a user falsely claiming to be a legitimate company’s Web site asking for personal information.

  * Report the identity theft and request a "fraud alert." This ensures that you will be contacted before any new account is opened and/or an existing account is changed. 
  * Request copies of credit reports. Review the reports carefully and identify any new accounts that may have been opened. Pay particular attention to the section of the report that lists "inquiries" from new companies. Contact these companies immediately and have them remove any pending or new accounts from their system. **Note: Credit bureaus must provide free copies of credit reports to victims of identity theft.**
  * Contact the fraud departments of creditors to dispute unauthorized charges (e.g., credit card issuer, phone companies, utilities, banks, other lenders.) Describe your identity theft problem and follow up with a letter. 
  * FiIe a report with your local police department. This may help when clearing your credit. 
  * File a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC handles complaints from victims of identity theft, provides information to those victims, and refers complaints to appropriate entities, including the major credit-reporting agencies and law enforcement agencies. 
  * By phone: 877-ID-THEFT

1\. "Account access information" includes your login ID, password, or any other information used by U.S. Trust to authenticate you; as well as payment devices such as credit cards, debit cards and checks. We may hold you responsible, if we determine that you shared this information or unauthorized activity was caused by your fraudulent conduct or gross negligence.

This includes authority to manage your account, and any other power of attorney you may have granted. This applies to activity by your employer and their employees, representative or agent which have authority to access your Employee Benefit Plan Account.
