## Fulfilment of products, services and features of the Sites and Applications

We collect and maintain personal information that you voluntarily submit to us by email, or during your use of the Sites, Applications, our products and/or our Services.

We do not share user data (or other personal data) that we might inadvertently process as part of helping our clients build, maintain and develop their own products, applications or software.

### What is our legal basis?

It is necessary for us to use your personal information in this way to perform our obligations in accordance with any contract that we may have with you, or to which the data subject is otherwise a party.

## Client relationship management and enquiries via our Site

Our Sites feature a “Contact Us” page which invites you to submit general enquiries, media enquiries, and games / ‘Monument Valley’ enquiries. We collect the personal data you submit to us when making your enquiry. 

Where you are a prospective client, we may use personal information that you voluntarily submit to us to prepare proposals for your purchase of our Services, to contact you, or otherwise to manage or administer our relationship with you.

### Who do we share your personal information with for this purpose?

We do not actively share your personal information with any third parties, but we do store your data using secure third party servers based in the cloud.

### What is our legal basis?

It is in our legitimate interest to use your personal information in such a way to ensure that we provide the very best client service we can to you.

## User insight and analysis

We may analyse your activity and interactions with the Sites and Applications. We do this either as a way of helping us to improve our own Sites (as a controller), or as part of the services we provide to our clients (as a processor). 

Where we process your user data as part of the services we provide to clients, this allows us to advise them on key analytics relating to their websites and apps. This helps our clients tailor projects for your benefit. 

Where you have given your consent (where lawfully required), we may use cookies, log files and other technologies to collect personal information in this way. This may include the following:

  * An IP address to monitor traffic and volume on the Sites;
  * A session ID to track usage statistics on the Sites; or
  * Information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, participation habits, experiences with our projects and interactive features.



Our Sites and emails may contain cookies, web beacons and pixel tags (“Tags”). Tags allow us to track receipt of an email to you, to count users that have visited a web page or opened an email and collect other types of aggregate information. Once you click on an email that contains a Tag, your contact information may subsequently be cross-referenced to the source e-mail and the relevant Tag.

In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to certain websites administered by us or on our behalf. We may track click-through data to assist in determining interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of these communications.

Please see our [Cookie Policy](https://www.iubenda.com/privacy-policy/322454/cookie-policy) for further information.

This information is used to create profiles and insights about your interaction with the Sites and Applications. Where we have your consent to do so, we may also use your location data for user insight purposes.

By using this information, we are able to measure the effectiveness of content and how visitors use the Sites, Applications and our Services. This allows us to learn what pages of the Sites and Applications are most attractive to visitors, which parts are the most interesting, and what kind of offers registered users like to see. 

### Who do we share your personal information with for these purposes?

We share your personal information with a variety of third party service providers to assist us with user insight analytics. These providers include those described in our [Cookie Policy](https://www.iubenda.com/privacy-policy/322454/cookie-policy). 

### What is our legal basis?

Where your personal information is completely anonymised, we do not require a legal basis to use it as the information will no longer constitute personal information that is regulated under data protection laws. However, our collection and use of such anonymised personal information may be subject to other laws where your consent is required. Please see our [Cookie Policy](https://www.iubenda.com/privacy-policy/322454/cookie-policy) for further details. 

Where your personal information is not in an anonymous form, it is in our legitimate interest to use your personal information in such a way to ensure that we provide the very best services to you and our other customers. We will only use your location data for user insight purposes where we have your consent to do so.

Alternatively you may submit queries or feedback to us via the “Contact Us” section on our Site. We use this information to help us improve the quality of service provided by us. We also use your feedback to monitor the quality of our services and to assist with the selection of future interactive features and service lines.

### Who do we share your personal information with for these purposes?

We often use a third party service provider to assist us with customer surveys and feedback requests.

  * processing your personal information for direct marketing. 



### Your rights in relation to automated decision-making and profiling.
