# Privacy Policy 1CAK For Fun Only

* ### Introduction

1CAK Ã‚Â takes the private nature of your personal information very seriously.

This privacy policy, which we adapted from a policy originally provided byÃ‚Â [Automattic](http://www.automattic.com/)Ã‚Â ([WordPress.com](http://www.wordpress.com/)), describes how we treat the information we collect when you visit and use our websites. Please read this notice very carefully.

* ### Website Visitors

Like most website operators,Ã‚Â  1CAK Ã‚Â Ã‚Â collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.Ã‚Â  1CAK Ã‚Â Ã‚Â purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand howÃ‚Â  1CAKÃ‚Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s visitors use its website. From time to time,Ã‚Â  1CAK Ã‚Â Ã‚Â may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g. by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

1CAKÃ‚Â also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.Ã‚Â  1CAKÃ‚Â Ã‚Â does not use such information to identify its visitors, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

* ### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to 1CAKÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s websites choose to interact withÃ‚Â  1CAKÃ‚Â Ã‚Â in ways that requireÃ‚Â  1CAKÃ‚Â Ã‚Â to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that 1CAK gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up forÃ‚Â  1CAKÃ‚Â .com to provide a username and email address. In each case,Ã‚Â  1CAKÃ‚Â Ã‚Â collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s interaction withÃ‚Â  1CAKÃ‚Â .Ã‚Â  1CAKÃ‚Â Ã‚Â does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

* ### Aggregated Statistics

1CAK may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance,Ã‚Â  1CAKÃ‚Â Ã‚Â may monitor the most popular collections onÃ‚Â  1CAKÃ‚Â .com.Ã‚Â  1CAKÃ‚Â Ã‚Â may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, 1CAK does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

* ### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

1CAK discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on 1CAKÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s behalf or to provide services available atÃ‚Â  1CAKÃ‚Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country: by using 1CAKÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. In addition, in some cases we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if 1CAK or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that 1CAK goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquiror of 1CAK may continue to use your personal and non-personal information only as set forth in this policy. Otherwise, 1CAK will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.

Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, 1CAK discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when 1CAK believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of 1CAK, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a 1CAK website and have supplied your email address, 1CAK may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going on with 1CAK and its products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. 1CAK takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

You should also be aware that if you submit information to Ã¢â‚¬Å“chat rooms,Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬Å“forumsÃ¢â‚¬Â or Ã¢â‚¬Å“message boardsÃ¢â‚¬Â such information becomes public information, meaning that you lose any privacy rights you might have with regards to that information. Such disclosures may also increase your chances of receiving unwanted communications.
