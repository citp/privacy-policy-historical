        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
           <div class="pad25">

             <p>We use the information you provide us (during registration process   etc) to keep track of the 160by2 products and services that you   have signed up to receive. Though the senders name shall be displayed as   160by2.com ( or 160by2's mobile number in case of CDMA subscriber) your   mobile number, as recorded in your profile, shall be appended at the   end of your personal message.

             <p>Any information/content that is sent to 160by2 for SMS text   messaging and/or storage purposes will remain the property of the User.   160by2 will at no time collect or redistribute this information   without obtaining your consent, except where legally required by law to   do so. This has particular reference to any database, numbers and/or   recipient details that you may deliver to us, or store on our databases.</p>
             <p>As a matter of policy, we neither rent nor sell personally   identifiable information about our Users to any third party. We may   however aggregate all personally identifiable information and may   disclose such aggregated information to any or all advertisers,   marketing and general or commercial promotional purposes. Even in these   cases, disclosure of any information that could personally identify you   would not be permitted.</p>
             <p>160by2 may offer some features where sometimes it is required   to provide some of the information about you to a third party, which is   offering such services. It must be understood clearly that we will   provide information only to the extent that the said third party   requires your information, which enables you to use their service, but   prior to that we will make efforts to notify you of specific information   being provided to such third parties. Before you use the services of   any third party, we request you to check up and evaluate if the terms   and conditions of said third party services are acceptable to you.</p>
             <p>160by2 might use third-party advertising companies to serve   ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not   including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about   your visits to this and other websites in order to provide   advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would   like more information about this practice and to know your choices   about not having this information used by these companies, <a href="http://www.160by2.com/160by2_mobile_application.aspx" target="_blank"><strong>click here</strong></a></p>
             <p>It is vital that 160by2 receives from you the permission and   valid rights to transmit your information to a third party.

             <h3>ANTI SPAM POLICY:</h3>
             <p>Any registered User of 160by2 can send SMS text messages to   his/her friends, family, colleagues, clients, contacts etc using the   160by2 Interface. These interface conditions of use strictly forbid   spamming to cell phone Users. We have several software filters to block   spam messages. However, we cannot guarantee that spamming will not ever   occur. Please let us know (email to contactus@160by2.com) the   details of the message like content of message, time of delivery, sender   name or number etc so that we can immediately check and block the user   responsible for the same.</p>
             <p>Appending contextual Ads to users SMS is not considered as spam   within the meaning of spam. Spam is a totally uninvited message urging   the recipient to avail of some services. But here the advertisement is   part of a personal message which the recipient receives and is not a   totally uninvited message. Also, the user has specifically opted-in to   use this FREE service to send SMS to the recipient. Further the   communication is between two known persons. </p>
             <h3>LIMITS ON OUR ABILITIES:</h3>

Additionally, we may (and here you give us authorization to) disclose   any private information about you to private entities, law enforcement   or other government officials, which we may believe to be necessary at   our sole discretion or appropriate to address or to resolve inquiries or   problems. We undertake that this will not be done for commercial   purposes or for our personal gain.</p>
