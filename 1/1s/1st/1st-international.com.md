# Privacy statement for 1st International Marriage Network.

**Information Collection and Use**

When you browse our site we do not reqire any personal information from you except we use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our web site and collect regional demographic information. Our site also utilizes cookies to keep track of your order and to personalize your experience at 1st International Marriage Network. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to track your order history. 

When you submit your profile on our site, participage in a forum, or process an order you consent to the collection, transfer and storage of the following information to our servers located in the United States and Germany:

email address, physical contact information, and (depending on the service used) sometimes financial information, such as credit card or bank account numbers;   
your personal information that you choose to disclose on your profile;  
transactional information based on your activities on the Site (such as list of members you contact);  
billing and other information you provide to receive information and messages from us;  
community discussions, chats, correspondence through the Site, and correspondence sent to us;  
computer sign-on data, statistics on page views, traffic to and from the Site, and ad data: other information, including IP address and standard web log information;

**Order**

We DO NOT sell or rent any personally identifiable information about you to any third party without your permission. We request information from the user on our order form. Here a user should provide contact information (like name and e-mail) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date etc.). This information is collected by our bank, which provides highly secure payment processing for 1st International Marriage Network. Credit card information is encrypted using the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocol implemented by Netscape and Internet Explorer. 

**Security**

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. We have a secure ordering process provided by Eplastic. 

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software available in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order and order confirmation forms, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing' (in non-secure mode). 

**Newsletter**

If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as email address. We will send you our newsletters on a regular basis to the email adddress you provide. You can unsubscribe at any time. We will never give out your e-mail address to any other parties under any circumstances. E-mail address will be kept strictly confidential and not given or sold to anyone. 

**Third Parties**  
Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to others, whether they are our members or forum participants or other sites throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. 

**Correspondence**  
Our Site enables you to exchange messages and share personal information in order to communicate with other members. We cannot guarantee the privacy or security of your information which you voluntarily disclose to other members. To help protect your privacy, we do not allow other users to access your personal contact information. To prevent unsolicited messages, illegal schemes such as soliciting money we reserver the right to monitor the correspondence that is going through our servers, and prevent certain messages from reaching their recipients.

**General**   
We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended terms on the Site. All amended terms automatically take effect 30 days after they are initially posted on the Site.
