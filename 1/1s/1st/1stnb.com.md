 **Internet Applicable Privacy Disclosure**

Visitors to the First National Bank Texas/First Convenience Bank (the "Bank") website remain anonymous. We do not collect unique identifying information about you individually unless you voluntarily and knowingly provide us that information. The only time we will send you a "cookie" is when you have used the portal and the separate Internet Banking website. A "cookie" is data that is given to a browser by a web server that is returned by the browser on subsequent transmissions to identify the user and specifically designated information.

We do collect general information about your visit, such as when our site was accessed, which pages were accessed and what Internet provider was used. We cannot identify a specific user from this record. You may elect to provide us with more specific information, such as when you give us feedback or send us an email.

If you would like to know what information we have collected regarding your visit to our website, contact Customer Support or the specific department you emailed (e.g. Customer Support, Loans, etc.). If you believe any of it is in error, please contact Customer Support or that specific department and explain the alleged discrepancy. If the information is incorrect, we will update it promptly. In addition, if you believe any information we have collected about you has been used for an improper purpose, contact our Compliance Officer and explain your concerns in as much detail as possible, so we may take any appropriate action.

 **Links**

We have a number of links to other sites on our website. These are offered as a courtesy and a convenience. We assume no responsibility for the content, safety, security, or privacy of any such site or any transactions with respect thereto. If you have questions or concerns about any other site's policy regarding these matters, you should contact that site or its sponsor.
