# Privacy ∴ 1stBrowser

Last modified: 09-29-2015

The SIEN Privacy Policy describes how we treat personal information when you use SIEN's products and services, including when you use 1stBrowser to access those products and services. This SIEN Privacy Notice describes the privacy practices that are specific to 1stBrowser.

SIEN will notify you of any material changes to this policy, and you will always have the option to use 1stBrowser in a way that does not send any personally identifiable information to SIEN, or to remove your information and discontinue using it.

## Information SIEN receives when you use 1stBrowser

You do not need to provide any personally identifying information in order to use 1stBrowser.

When you use any browser, including 1stBrowser, to contact SIEN's servers, by default SIEN receives standard log information including your system’s IP address and one or more cookies. You can configure 1stBrowser to not accept cookies from SIEN or other sites. [Learn more about configuring cookies and site data in 1stBrowser.](http://1stbrowser.com/Corporate/Cookies)

If you use 1stBrowser to access other SIEN services the fact that you are using 1stBrowser does not cause SIEN to receive any special or additional personally identifying information about you. In addition, some 1stBrowser features may send limited additional information to SIEN or your default search engine :

  * When you use 1stBrowser’s default search engine, 1stBrowser will contact SIEN servers when it starts or when you change networks so as to determine the best local web address to send search queries. When you type URLs or queries in the 1stBrowser address bar (omnibox) or App Launcher search box, the letters you type may be sent to your default search engine so that the search engine’s prediction feature can automatically recommend terms or URLs you may be looking for. If you accept a predicted query or URL, 1stBrowser may send that information from the browser to your default search engine as well.
  * If you navigate to a URL that does not exist, 1stBrowser may send the URL to SIEN so we can help you find the URL you were looking for. We may also use this information in an aggregated way to help other web users - e.g. to let them know that the site may be down.
  * 1stBrowser periodically contacts SIEN to perform functions such as checking for updates, checking connectivity status, validating current time, and estimating the number of active users. Each copy of 1stBrowser includes a temporary randomly-generated installation number which will be sent to SIEN when you install and first use the product. The temporary number will be promptly deleted the first time that 1stBrowser automatically checks for updates. If you received or reactivated your copy of the 1stBrowser as part of a promotional campaign, it may also generate a non-unique promotional tag which is sent to SIEN when performing searches with SIEN and a unique token which is sent to SIEN when you first run and use the browser after installation, reinstallation, or reactivation.. Furthermore, field trials may result in different variations of 1stBrowser, and 1stBrowser may send non-unique information to SIEN about which variation is active.
  * If you use the Translate feature of 1stBrowser, it will send the text you choose to be translated to third parties for translation.
  * If you use the Spellcheck feature of 1stBrowser it will send the text you type to third parties for spelling and grammar suggestions.
  * If you use 1stBrowser’s location feature, which allows you to share your location with a web site, 1stBrowser will send local network information to Google Location Services as it uses this service in order to provide its location information. Use of the Location Service is subject to the Google Privacy Policy (<http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html>).
  * For 1stBrowser, you may choose to send usage statistics and crash reports to SIEN . This setting will apply to all users for a given installation of 1stBrowser. The usage statistics and crash reports help us diagnose problems, help us understand how users interact with 1stBrowser, and help us improve 1stBrowser's performance.
  * 1stBrowser tries to avoid sending information that identifies you personally. Crash reports, however, can contain system information at the time of a malfunction, and errors leading up to a malfunction. We may share with third parties certain aggregated, non-personal information we derive from our analysis, such as how frequently certain types of crashes occur.



## Information SIEN sends when you use the Safe Browsing feature on 1stBrowser

SIEN 1stBrowser includes Google’s Safe Browsing feature. Safe Browsing sends and receives information between the browser you are using and Google’s servers about suspicious websites -- for example when you visit a site that is suspected to be a phishing or malware site.

Use of the Google Safe Browsing Service is subject to the Google Terms of Service (<http://www.google.com/terms_of_service.html>) and to Google's Privacy Policy ( http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html).

Information website operators receive when you visit a site using 1stBrowser

Sites that you visit using 1stBrowser will automatically receive standard log information similar to that received by SIEN. These sites may also set their own cookies or store site data on your system. You can restrict cookies and other site data in 1stBrowser's preferences page.

If 1stBrowser’s network actions prediction features are enabled, 1stBrowser may look up the IP addresses of all links on webpages and open network connections to load webpages faster. Sites can also use pre-rendering technology to pre-load the links that you might click next.

If you use 1stBrowser in incognito mode or guest mode, it will not transmit any pre-existing cookies to sites that you visit. Sites may deposit new cookies on your system while you are in these modes; these cookies will only be temporarily stored and transmitted to sites while you remain in incognito / guest mode. They will be deleted when you close the browser, close all open incognito windows or exit guest mode.

If you choose to use 1stBrowser’s location feature, this service allows you to share your location with a site. 1stBrowser will not allow a site to access your location without your permission. SIEN does not have control over third party websites or their privacy practices. Please carefully consider any website’s privacy practices before consenting to share your location with that website.

## Information stored on your system when you use 1stBrowser

1stBrowser stores some information locally on your system. This may include:

  * Basic browsing history information, for example the URLs of pages that you visit, a cache file of text and images from those pages, and a list of some IP addresses linked from pages that you visit .
  * A searchable index of most pages you visit (except for secure pages with "https" web addresses, such as some bank pages) Thumbnail-sized screenshots of most pages you visit
  * Cookies or web storage data deposited on your system by websites you visit
  * Locally-stored data saved by Add-ons
  * A record of downloads you have made from websites
  * You can always choose to [delete your browsing history information](http://1stbrowser.com/Corporate/History), in whole or in part.



You can also limit the information 1stBrowser stores on your system by using incognito mode or guest mode. The 1stBrowser offers both modes. Incognito mode is useful if you would still like to have access to information from your existing profile, such as suggestions based on your browsing history, while you are browsing. Guest mode is useful if you would prefer to begin a browsing session without seeing information from any existing profiles. In either of these modes, 1stBrowser will not store basic browsing history information such as URLs, cached page text, or IP addresses of pages linked from the websites you visit. It will also not store snapshots of pages that you visit or keep a record of your downloads (although this information could still be stored elsewhere on your system, e.g. in a list of recently opened files). New cookies received in these modes will not be saved after you close your browser, close all open incognito windows or exit guest mode. You can see when you are in incognito / guest mode because the incognito icon appears in the top corner of your browser; in some cases the border of your browser window may also change color. When you make changes to your browser configuration, such as by bookmarking a web page or changing your settings, this information is also saved. These changes are not affected by incognito / guest mode.

You can choose to have 1stBrowser save your passwords for specific websites. Stored passwords can be reviewed in 1stBrowser settings.

## Unique Identifiers for Digital Rights Management

In order to allow certain content to be accessed using 1stBrowser for Windows, 1stBrowser may be required to provide selected content partners and websites using Adobe Flash Access with a unique identifier that is stored on your system. You can disable this feature in the settings or reset the unique identifier’s value by reinstalling the operating system. Parties to whom your unique identifier is provided could associate it with personally-identifiable information you provide to them. If you are accessing content from a third party service, you should review those parties’ privacy policies to learn more.

## Using apps, extensions, themes, services, and other add-ons with 1stBrowser

You may use apps, extensions, themes, services and other add-ons ("Add-ons") with 1stBrowser, including some that may be pre-installed or integrated with 1stBrowser and some that you may obtain from other sources.

Before installing an Add-on, you should review the requested permissions. Add-ons may be designed to store, access, and share data stored locally or in your online accounts. Add-ons may use notifications that are sent through SIEN servers. 1stBrowser may check for, download, and install updates to your Add-ons. 1stBrowser may send usage indicators to SIEN for installed Add-ons. Some add-ons might require access to a unique identifier for digital rights management or for delivery of push messaging. You can disable the use of such an identifier by removing the add-on from 1stBrowser.

Add-ons developed and provided by SIEN may communicate with SIEN servers and are subject to these Policies unless otherwise indicated. Add-ons developed and provided by third parties are the responsibility of such third parties and may be subject to third party privacy policies. For example, a version of the Adobe Flash Player plug-in is preinstalled with 1stBrowser. Adobe’s website at www.adobe.com provides more information on Adobe’s privacy practices with regard to Flash Player.

## Uses

Information that SIEN receives when you use 1stBrowser is processed in order to operate and improve 1stBrowser and other SIEN services. Information that other website operators receive is subject to the privacy policies of those websites. 1stBrowser stores information on your system in order to improve 1stBrowser’s performance and to provide you with useful features and services.

## Phishing

Identity theft and the practice currently known as “phishing” are of great concern to SIEN. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your username, password or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the<http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0003-phishing> US Federal Trade Commission’s website.

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information. We may share aggregated information that does not include Personal Information and we may otherwise disclose Non-Identifying Information with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information.

## Service Providers

We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service, to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Service-related actions (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the Site or Application’s features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Site and Application are used. These third parties don’t have access to your Personal Information and are obligated not to disclose or use any user information for any other purpose.

## Collection of Information by Third Parties

We may enable trusted third parties to collect anonymous non-identifying information on you, by deploying certain collection technologies within 1stBrowser, for purpose of collecting and analyzing statistics and aggregated anonymous information on you, so that the Company can improve our Service. The use of these technologies by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by our Privacy Policy. We further represent that in some events, we may receive payment from these third parties.

## Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement

SIEN cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of SIEN or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.

## Business Transfers

SIEN may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.

## Security

SIEN is very concerned with safeguarding your information. We employ administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access. We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored “personal data” (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.

## International Transfer

Your information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United Kingdom and choose to provide information to us, SIEN transfers this information to the United Kingdom and processes it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.

## Links to Other Sites

You will be presented with and have access to links to other websites through your use of our Site and the Application. If you choose to visit an advertiser by “clicking on” a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party’s website. The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.
