We use your Personal Information according to the terms of the Privacy Policy and User Agreement in effect at the time of our use. We will process your Personal Information where (1) you have provided your consent which can be withdrawn at any time, (2) where the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party (for example, we will share your Personal Information with sellers with whom you have entered into a transaction), (3) where we are required by law, (4) where processing is required to protect your vital interests or those of another person, or (5) where the processing is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate commercial interests, except where such interest are overridden by your rights and interests.

a) We may use the Personal Information you give us for our legitimate commercial interests including, among other things:

– to respond to your inquiries and to provide you with the information, products and services that you request from us;

– to provide information on the products or services of our registered sellers with whom you are placed in touch with in connection with a prospective purchase;

– to verify that you qualify as a member of the Site;

– to send you communications about (1) our own products and services, (2) products and services offered by sellers or advertisers on our Site and (3) products and services of third parties (those not offered by sellers on our Site) that we think you may find of interest, provided you have given your consent;

– where the processing is required in order to enforce or apply our User Agreement and other agreements you have entered into; and

7\. International transfers

The Personal Information we receive may be held on our computers and systems in the European Union and in the computers and systems of our offices and data centers in the United States and may be accessed by or given to our staff working outside the European Union.

Your Personal Information may be processed by us in the United States, where laws regarding data protection may be less stringent than the laws in your country.

If you do not want to share search terms, or items you have viewed, saved, or purchased history with sellers you contact, you can update your profile preferences on your account page at any time.

Subject to any legislation which might, from time to time, oblige us to store the Personal Information for a certain period of time, we will respect your wishes to correct inaccurate Personal Information.

If you are not able to provide proof of your identity, we reserve the right to refuse to send you any PersonalInformation. We will respond as quickly as we can to your requests for details of Personal Information we hold about you.

9\. Security.

As a registered user of the Site, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your username and password. Please keep your user ID and password confidential.

If you share your computer, we recommend that you log-out and close your browser window after visiting the Site in order to protect the confidentiality of your Personal Information including your credit card information, your offer status and buying history.

You agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security. We reserve the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, or remove or edit content at our sole discretion.

We use reasonable physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to help us protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of data stored on our system. The Site encrypts your credit card number and other Personal Information using secure socket layer (SSL) technology to provide for the secure transmission of the Personal Information from your PC to our servers.

Except as specified in this Privacy Policy, we use commercially reasonable efforts to limit access to your Personal Information to the employees, officers, third-party contractors, and strategic partners of 1stdibs.com who need the Personal Information in order to perform their duties.

SSL is an industry-standard protocol for encryption over the Internet. While no system is 100% secure, we believe that the measures we have implemented minimize the risk of a security breach to an appropriate level given the types of Personal Information involved. Please note that any Personal Information you provide us by email is unencrypted.

Please note that transmission of Personal Information via the internet is not completely secure and although we will endeavor to protect your information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted to our Site; any transmission is therefore at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access, however.

10\. Opt- out

If you do not wish to receive offers or other notices from us in the future, you can “opt-out” by changing your preferences in My Account or by contacting us at the address indicated at the end of this policy. We will try to complete your request as promptly as possible. You can elect not to receive emails from us either by “unsubscribing” to an email you receive or by contacting us as indicated below. Any changes will affect only future uses of your information.

11\. Your California privacy rights

For California Residents Only. We may disclose your Personal Information to our affiliates or registered sellers when the third party receives Personal Information solely as a consequence of a single transaction where, as a part of the transaction, Personal Information had to be disclosed in order to effectuate the transaction.

12\. Your European privacy rights

For individuals within the EEA only. Under the GDPR, in certain circumstances, you have the right to: (a) request access to any Personal Information we hold about you and related information, (b) obtain without undue delay the rectification of any inaccurate Personal Information, (c) request that your Personal Information is deleted provided the Personal Information is not required by 1stdibs.com for compliance with a legal obligation under European or Member State law or for the establishment, exercise or defense of a legal claim, (d) prevent or restrict processing of your Personal Information, except to the extent processing is required for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; and (e) request transfer of your Personal Information directly to a third party where this is technically feasible.

In addition, where you believe that 1stdibs.com has not complied with its obligation under this Privacy Policy or European law, you have the right to make a complaint to an EU Data Protection Authority, such as the UK Information Commissioner’s Office.

13\. Links to third-party sites

When you use the Site or our service, you may be directed to other websites that are beyond our control. These may include merchant sites where you select items for purchase or payment sites where you pay for your purchases.

We may also allow third party sites or applications to link to the Site. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any third parties or the content of linked sites, but we do encourage you to read the applicable privacy policies and terms and conditions of such parties or websites.
