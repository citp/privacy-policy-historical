## Payment and Cancellation Policies

Below you will find our current payment and refund / replacement policy. Please read it carefully as this is the official policy in force at the present time. The policy listed below supersedes any other written document you may have received prior to today's date. If you have any questions or comments about this policy, please do not hesitate to contact us.

## Current Payment Policy

Effective immediately, the following payment policy MUST be adhered to. THERE ARE NO EXCEPTIONS, ALL FIRST ONLINE SOLUTIONS LTD. CLIENTS MUST READ, UNDERSTAND AND ADHERE TO THIS POLICY except by other written arrangements approved by FIRST ONLINE SOLUTIONS LTD. Late charges apply (see below).

Our typical policy is to collect payment on the date of service when we visit your office or residence to provide a service or deliver products. If you are on a VIP-plan, and you purchase any products and/or services from us that are not covered by the VIP-plan, and we visit your office to install these non-covered products and/or provide non-covered services, you may pay the technician the full amount due for said products, services and mileage charges in cash or by check before the technician leaves your office. If you do not pay in full before the technician leaves the office, we will bill you for non-covered products and services. Late charges apply (see below).

In the case of products or services ordered online and delivered by Internet, e-mail or postal mail, payment MUST BE RECEIVED BEFORE PRODUCT IS DELIVERED TO YOU.

If, for any reason, we send an invoice to you for any products or services, regardless if you are on a VIP-plan or not, payment must be sent within 5 business days of your receipt of the invoice, unless other FIRST ONLINE SOLUTIONS LTD approved arrangements have been made ahead of time. Late charges apply (see below).

### LATE CHARGES:

ALL payments such as invoices, visit fees, service charges and mileage charges described in the above policy MUST BE RECEIVED BY FIRST ONLINE SOLUTIONS LTD immediately upon completion of said services for any services or products delivered in person (or within 5 business days from the day you received an invoice) or late fees in the amount of 10% of the outstanding total will be assessed. This applies to ALL clients, without exception.

Non-payment may result in your account being sent to collections, your credit standing with us being downgraded and possible litigation to recover payment. If you have questions or concerns, or you feel that you have been charged incorrectly, please contact us IMMEDIATELY so that we can work together to find a solution.

We prefer to work payment issues out in a positive way and we try not to resort to sending payments to collections or small-claims unless we have no recourse.

### Current Refund / Replacement Policy

ALL sales (including VIP-plans) are final. We do not offer refunds on any service packages at this time.

If the products, support or services you purchased from us do not meet your needs, please contact us immediately and we will work with you to add the features you want or to correct any perceived issues.

If you are dissatisfied with the level of support you are receiving from us after purchasing one of our products or services, please contact us with your concerns so that we can address this issue immediately. We value you as a client and strive for your satisfaction.
