# 1st Wishes: Privacy Policy

## Privacy Policy

We make it our top priority to safeguard the privacy of our online customers, and we take great care in making sure your personal identifiable information is secure. 

Our Web site uses Microsoft Site Server Microsoft .NET technology which allows IP Addresses to be collected and used for administrative purposes, and to analyze traffic patterns for this site. However, no single individual is identified in the analysis of Web traffic. This technology also includes the use of cookies, which benefit visitors by saving their information so they don't have to re-type it on subsequent visits to our site. Cookies may be disabled by the user, however, the user would not be able to order products from our site because our shopping cart functionality requires the use of cookies to operate.

1st Wishes collects only personally identifiable data, such as names, addresses, e-mail addresses, and the like, when voluntarily submitted by visitors. (In some cases, we do ask parents/guardians to provide children's birth month and year information so that we may send a catalog from 1st Wishes or our sister company, Birthday Express, at the appropriate time for party planning.)

We also collect payment information in order to bill shoppers for items they ordered. To complete business transactions, credit card numbers are verified by a qualified financial institution using secure encryption technology before an order is shipped.

While we may communicate with visitors via e-mail about their order, we will not send promotional e-mails unless the visitor has specifically chosen to receive such messages. We do not share e-mail addresses with third parties.

Persons who supply us with their phone number(s) online may receive a phone contact from us with information regarding orders they have placed online. When providing your phone number, please provide both the area code and number. Your phone number will not be shared with anyone. 

Parents and guardians: We want to help you guard your children's privacy. 1st Wishes does not collect any personal information on those sections of the site that may be considered designed for the use of children under the age of 13.
