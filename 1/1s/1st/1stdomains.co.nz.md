# 1st Domains: Privacy Policy

  
The statement applies to user interaction with the registrar of the website, 1st Domains - a Division of Net24 Limited, which accepts the applications for registration of domain names. 

Information that you provide.  
When you request 1st Domains to act as your registrar for your domain name, we request from you certain personal information. All the information that we request is compulsory in order to enable 1st Domains to process your application, unless otherwise clearly stated. The information that you provide must be complete, accurate and current at the time of registration.   
In addition to the information you provide on the request for registration, we also maintain a record of whether and when you use the information and services that we provide. We use this information in order to assess the services that we provide and to ensure that they respond to your needs and interests. We also record site traffic patterns and maintain log files of users' access to site files.   
1st Domains also tracks user traffic patterns throughout and we use this information to compare with data about individual users. 1st Domains also uses cookies for keeping track of user login and session data. 

Certain financial information is recorded for our accounting systems, however your credit card information provided at our web site is discarded after use and is not stored.

What happens and what we do with the information that you have provided.  
The information that you provide is stored on our databases. We use the information for statistical purposes such as to gauge customer's interests and to assist in providing customer support and services. We may from time to time contact you with new service offerings. You may remove yourself from these mailings at anytime by emailing us at: service@1stdomains.co.nz

Security of Information   
The information that you provide and which we receive is stored on our systems that are designed to prevent the loss, misuse, unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of that information. We encrypt certain sensitive information such as usernames and passwords to ensure maximum protection. 

Public Information   
As an .nz authorised registrar we maintain a WhoIs database that is accessible by any user. The information that is available includes the registered domain name and the name, email address, telephone numbers and postal address of the point of contact. The amount of information that is disclosed on the WhoIs database may change from time to time and we review that regularly. 

Your Rights to Access and Change Information   
You have the right and we encourage you to correct or change information in our records such as address and contact information. You may do this by accessing the 1st Domains website at: http://www.1stdomains.co.nz. You can make changes at any time and as often as you need to maintain currency and accuracy of the information. Alternatively, you can email us at: service@1stdomains.co.nz

Sharing Information   
To comply with our contractual obligations, we provide your domain name and the IP numbers to the appropriate registry (the organisation which assumes responsibility for domain name allocation). We provide this information to ensure that the domain name operates as a functional access on the Internet.   
We also share your information, including sensitive information, with those entities that we engage to perform certain necessary functions such as managing your account. We do not share your information with other third parties except where we are obliged by court order or other request from a law enforcement authority. 

Our Accountability   
When you purchase our services there is a mutual obligation: for you to provide certain accurate information and for 1st Domains to safeguard the information and to use and protect it as stated in this statement. It is 1st Domain's practice to permit only those employees who are authorised to access and use your information for the purposes outlined in this statement. If you choose to visit 1st Domains, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice and Terms and Conditions, including limitations on damages, and application of the law of New Zealand. If you have any concern about privacy at 1st Domains, please contact Customer Service and we will try to resolve it. Our business changes constantly. This Notice and the Services Agreement will change also, and use of information that we gather now is subject to the Privacy Notice in effect at the time of use. You should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes.
