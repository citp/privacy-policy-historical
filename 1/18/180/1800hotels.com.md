Your Privacy Rights

We want to make your experience online satisfying and safe. We want to provide you with the means to control your privacy and give you a way to voice questions or concerns you may have.

Information is collected from you to make it easier and more rewarding for you to use our services. By knowing customer preferences, services and special offerings can be tailored to provide superior levels of convenience. Depending on the service you are accessing, you could be asked at various times to provide information such as your name, email address or information about what you like and do not like. On other occasions when we provide items for purchase online, we may request your credit card number to conclude the transaction or your mailing address to insure proper delivery. Consistent with the Federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from minors.

We collect information in several different ways. We collect:

The domain name of visitors to our Web pages, The e-mail addresses of those visitors who volunteer them, User-specific information on the pages visitors access, and information such as survey information, Postal address, telephone numbers and site registrations that you provide voluntarily. Like many other commercial websites, our websites may employ a standard technology called a “cookie” to collect information about how our site is used.

We will not transfer information to competitors. Information about your preferences is only used to help us understand the products and services that might be attractive to you. If you provide us with your e-mail address, we may occasionally send you e-mail offers, informing you about products and services. If you provide us with your postal address, you may receive periodic mailings from us with information on new products and services or upcoming events. These offers may be based on information you provided us in your responses to our surveys and on your history with us as a customer.

 **Information Distribution**

Although unlikely, we may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide personally identifiable information to the appropriate governmental authorities. If requested as part of a legal proceeding, we will provide this information upon receipt of the appropriate documentation.

Other companies which could place advertising on our site may collect information about you when you view or click on their advertising or content through the use of cookies.

You should contact these advertisers or content providers if you have any questions about their use of the information they collect.
