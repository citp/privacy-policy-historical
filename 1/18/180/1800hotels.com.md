# 1800HOTELS - Privacy Policy

## 1800HOTELS takes privacy and security very seriously. We respect your rights as if they were our own. Be assured your personal information will never be sold or uneccessarily shared.

After using major hotel booking sites in the past I noticed I was getting all kinds of offers and spam. I realized that these companies had sold my email address to third parties and I was furious. When I discovered 1 800 Hotels, I read the fine print and felt safe and secure booking through their site. They make it clear that they will never sell my information to any third parties.
