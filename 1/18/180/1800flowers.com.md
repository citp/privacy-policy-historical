We do not store any personal information (except your name) or financial information about you through the use of cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but most allow you to instruct your browser to prevent the use of cookies. However, if you disable this feature, certain aspects of the 1-800-FLOWERS.COM® Web Site, such as the shopping basket, may not function properly. Our Web Site also uses a common web technology called “action tags” (also called single pixel gifs or web beacons) to anonymously track purchase, usage and other web information. Action tags (including third party tags) may be used to provide data to third parties for tracking purposes. However, no personal information is collected or transferred using action tags on our Web Site
