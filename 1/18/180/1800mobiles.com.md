When customers buy a phone, they are also making a commitment with a specific carrier for a minimum of 12 months. Carriers require credit history checks when activating new service. These credit checks are not required when 1800mobiles customers are purchasing accessories, electronics or any other product that does not involve a contract with a wireless carrier.

Personally identifiable information connected to the activation of wireless services is collected by co-branded sites operated by Simplexity and Letstalk. These applications uses personal information such as social security number or date of birth, to run a credit history check for wireless service activation. They perform a standard industry credit check by inputting your data into the wireless carrier system. Once the carrier runs the check, it informs the application of your approval status so that it can either process the order where the credit is approved or notify if you have not matched the carrier's credit requirements. Aside from approval status information, the application does not have access to any credit-history information and it does not use it or re-sells it in any other way.

1800Mobiles has an opt-in email newsletter containing marketing and promotional offers. These email newsletters are from 1800mobiles.com only and it is entirely your choice whether you want to receive them or not. Newsletter broadcasting infrastructure may be powered by a third-party provider. We will ask for your email address when signing up for this service.
