<h2>How We Collect Information</h2>

<p><b>Information You Provide.</b>  We may collect and store information that you voluntarily supply to us while on our Site. This may include information that can be used to contact or identify you, such as 
your name, email address, or postal address.  Some examples of this type of information include information that you electronically submit when you contact us with questions or participate in 
contests, surveys or sweepstakes, information that you post on blogs, discussion forums or other community posting and social networking areas on our Site, and information that you electronically 
submit when you complete an online registration form to access and use certain features of our Site. We also may ask for information (including a credit card number and other financial information)

<p><b>Location Information.</b>  We may collect location information (e.g., city and state and/or zip code) that you provide.  Certain devices and browsers contain unique identifiers that can be used to 
identify the geographical location of the device.  When you use such a device or browser to access our Site, your device and/or browser may automatically collect and/or transmit your location 
information.  We also may collect GPS information from the device if the device transmits it. Additionally, if you download our app, we may collect your location information in order to deliver our

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Other Information Automatically Collected to Improve the Site and Deliver Targeted Advertising.</b>  We also collect and store information through a variety of automatic technologies, such as browser and

improve the delivery of our web pages to you and to measure traffic on the Site.</p>

<p>We may use location information, either information you provided by you or information automatically collected, in order to provide you with content, services and advertising that is relevant to 
your geographic area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may combine information we collect from you while you are using our Site with information that we collect from other sources to customize features, content and advertising that appear on our

while using the Site, you may not be able to use or participate in some or all of the features offered through the Site.   </p>

such disclosure is reasonably necessary: (a) to comply with legal process; (b) to enforce our <a href="/tos.html">Terms of Service</a>; or (c) to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of our Site, us, our affiliates,

			<p>10Best provides its users with original, unbiased, and experiential travel content on top attractions, things to do, and restaurants for top destinations in the US and around the world. The core of the site's power is its team of local experts, a well-traveled and well-educated group who are not only experts in their fields (and their cities) but discriminating in their tastes. These local experts live in the city they write about so our content is more up-to-date than any guidebook around.  Some of the venues reviewed provided complimentary services. </p>
