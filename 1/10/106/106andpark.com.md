# Privacy Policy | BET

Last Updated: February 25, 2011

**Privacy Policy and California Privacy Rights**

This is the official Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) for www.bet.com (collectively, the “Site,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), its affiliated sites and all associated or affiliated web pages, services, mobile applications, features, functions and any other activities made available by BET Interactive, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Black Entertainment Television LLC (collectively, “BET.com”).  We have adopted and implemented this Privacy Policy as part of our commitment to protecting our users’ Personal Information from misuse.  For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, when we use the term “BET.com” we are also referring to networks, programming, services, mobile applications and websites offered by Black Entertainment Television LLC, including but not limited to, BET Mobile.

  
The phrase “Personal Information” as used in this Privacy Policy and the [Terms of Use Agreement](http://www.bet.com/terms-of-use.html) means any information such as a user’s full name, street address, town or city, state, zip code, telephone number, date of birth, email address and any other Sensitive Personal Information or personally identifiable information that would allow someone to identify or contact a BET.com user. Your credit card or debit card number is classified as “Sensitive Personal Information.” 

The term “Site” includes all websites and webpages within BET.com, any equivalent, mirror, replacement, substitute or backup websites and webpages that are associated with the Site, and any mobile applications which are provided by or interact with BET.com.

The Site is offered and made available only to users 13 years of age or older who reside in the United States of America; however, certain features and functions may be limited to persons in older age groups (e.g. 21 and over).  If you are not yet 13 years old (or the requisite age for a certain feature or function on the Site), or do not reside in the United States, or if you do not agree with all of the terms and conditions contained in this Privacy Policy for any reason, please discontinue using the Site immediately.  By using this Site, you certify that you are at least 13 years of age (or the requisite age for a certain feature or function on the Site), reside in the United States and agree to the terms and conditions below.

This Privacy Policy applies whether you are accessing the Site via a personal computer, a mobile or wireless device, mobile application or any other technology or devices now known or hereafter developed or discovered (each, a “Device”) and whether you are accessing the Site as a registered user or other user of the Site. This Privacy Policy will remain in full force and effect, even if your use of or participation in the Site or any particular feature or function offered through the Site terminates, expires, ceases or is deactivated for any reason.

BET.com reserves the right to revise this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason and reserves the right to make changes at any time to any of the information contained in this Privacy Policy.  By entering and using the services provided by the Site, you acknowledge and agree that you shall be bound by this Privacy Policy and any such revisions.  We suggest users periodically review this Privacy Policy to be aware of any modifications to these terms and conditions.

**Your California Privacy Rights.  
**Users who reside in California can prevent future disclosures of their Personal Information, at no charge, by exercising their opt-out rights by using the procedures described below:

  
1\. You can send email to: [contactus@bet.com](mailto:contactus@bet.com), or

  
2\. You can send mail to the following postal address:  
          BET Interactive, LLC  
          One BET Plaza  
          1235 W Street, NE  
          Washington, DC  20018  
          Attn: General Counsel

All requests must be labeled “Your California Privacy Rights” on the email subject line or envelope or post card. For all requests, please clearly state that the request is related to “Your California Privacy Rights,” include your name, street address, city, state, zip code and email address (your street address is optional if you wish to receive a response to your request via email) and indicate your preference on how our response to your request should be sent (email or postal mail). We will not accept requests via the telephone or by facsimile. We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete information. 

Additionally, upon receipt of any communication from BET.com, you can click on the ‘unsubscribe’ link to unsubscribe from future communications,

Because BET.com provides its California users with the ability to exercise their opt-in and opt-out rights as described above, pursuant to Section 1798.83(c)(2) of the California Civil Code, BET.com is not obligated to maintain or disclose a list of the names and addresses of the third parties that received Personal Information for marketing purposes during the preceding year.

Please be aware that other websites that may be accessed through the Site (including, without limitation, stores listed on BET.com) may collect Personal Information about you. The information practices of those websites linked to the Site are governed by the privacy policies of those websites and are not covered by this privacy statement, and BET.com is not responsible for any information that you provide when you access those websites.

**United States Jurisdiction.**

The Site is designed and targeted to U.S. audiences and is governed by and operated in accordance with the laws of the U.S. We make no representation that this Site is operated in accordance with the laws or regulations of, or governed by, other nations.  If you are located in the European Union or elsewhere outside of the U.S. and you participate in activities on this Site contrary to our policy that only U.S. residents are eligible for certain activities, you do so at your own risk and initiative, and you, not us, are responsible for compliance with any applicable local and national laws. Please be aware that any Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information that you provide to us or we obtain as a result of your use of this Site will be transferred to the U.S. and subject to U.S. law. By using this Site, participating in any Site activities, and/or providing us with your Personal Information and/or Sensitive Personal Information, you consent to this transfer and processing of such information to and in the U.S., and in other countries that may not have an equivalent level of protection or a level of data protection considered adequate in the European Union or European Economic Area. Consequently, you hereby waive any claims that may arise under the laws and regulations that apply to you in or of any other country or jurisdiction. All users of the Site are required to provide true, current, complete and accurate Personal Information and Sensitive Personal Information when prompted and we will reject and delete any entry that we believe in good faith to be false, fraudulent, or inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.

**Storage of Personal Information**.   
Your continued use of the Site indicates your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and of the collection, use, disclosure, management and storage of your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information as described below. We may from time to time, transfer or merge any Personal Information collected offline to our databases or store offline information in an electronic format.  We may also combine Personal Information we collect online with information available from other sources, including information received from our Affiliates, marketing companies, or Advertisers (as defined in the [Terms of Use Agreement](http://www.bet.com/terms-of-use.html)). This Privacy Policy covers all such Personal Information and will remain in full force and effect as long as you are a user of the Site and for a reasonable period thereafter, even if your use of or participation in any particular service, feature, function or promotional activity terminates, expires, ceases, is suspended or deactivated for any reason. Please note that we may engage third party service providers to store information on their databases on behalf of BET.com. 

**Information BET.com Collects.**  
Some functions, mobile applications or promotions, as well as some areas of BET.com, require users to register before they can use or access a particular area of the Site (which may be necessary for identification, security, or marketing purposes, etc.).  BET.com’s registration, online surveys, contest entry forms, mobile applications and specialized services may call for users to provide Personal Information and demographic information (like their age or income level).  Additionally, BET.com’s registration process requires users to choose a unique User ID and password.  Users may change his or her password, as well as any Personal Information provided to us, to keep his or her registration information current.

To the extent that we offer online sales or shopping services, if you order any of our products, in addition to your name and contact information, we will also collect and maintain certain Sensitive Personal Information, including your credit card or other payment instrument information, billing address, shipping address, product selections, your order number, and information about your computer’s Internet address and website which may have referred or directed you to the Site (e.g., the referring URL).

**Cookies.**

We use the standard “cookie” or “web beacon” features of major browser applications to allow us to store data about your visit, including the collection of your IP address or other such identifiers associated with the Device you use to access the Site. Cookies help us learn which areas of the Site are useful and which areas need improvement. We may use cookies in a number of ways, including personalizing your experience with the Site; keeping track of user return visits to the Site or our Advertisers’ or business partners’ websites; accumulating and reporting aggregate, statistical information in connection with BET.com user visits; delivering to our users content specific to their interests; and saving users’ ID, passwords, or other information so users don’t have to re-enter it each time they visit the Site.  We also may use cookies to track visits and to track your progress and number of entries in some of our promotions, sweepstakes, and contests. By visiting the Site, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, understand and hereby agree that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of the Site through use of cookies, web beacons or other similar tracking technologies.

Advertisements displayed on the Site, and links to other websites, may also contain cookies. We may also use third parties to display or serve advertising on the Site and to distribute our emails or newsletters.  These third party companies may employ cookies and other technologies to measure advertising effectiveness. You should be aware that different rules may apply to the collection or use of the Personal Information you disclose to these third parties. Even if we have a relationship with the third party, we do not control those sites or their technologies, policies, and practices regarding your Personal Information. _This Privacy Policy does not cover any use of Personal Information that a third party Advertiser or ad server may collect from you._   Use of Advertisers’ tracking technology is subject to their own privacy policies and terms of service.  

We may also gather anonymous information, which may be used by us or shared with third parties. This is information which does not personally identify you, but which may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer. For example, we might tell our Advertisers how many users visited a particular advertisement, and how long, so they can measure whether the ad worked. This information is also used to generate advertising rates. Generally this information is collected through “traffic data” and may entail the use of numeric codes used to identify a computer.

**What BET.com does with Collected Personal Information.**  
BET.com’s primary goal in collecting Personal Information is to provide the user with a customized experience on our Site. This includes personalization services, interactive communications, and many other types of services, most of which are completely free to our users. In order to provide services free of charge, we display advertisements. By knowing a little about users, BET.com is able to deliver more relevant advertisements and content, and hence better service, to our users.

We may use Personal Information from our online registration, surveys, contests, mobile applications, specialized services, and order forms for our own internal evaluation and tracking purposes and to send our users information from our company (e.g., site announcements, newsletters, and message notifications) and promotional material from some of our business partners (or from other companies).

If you supply such Personal Information, it may also be used to:

·                     Contact you about products and services in which you have indicated an interest, and may be shared with our third party advertisers, business partners, or other companies who may want to contact you, if you have provided your consent through an “opt-in” (in which case their use of your Personal Information is subject to such third party’s privacy policy and terms of use) (you may opt-out of receiving future mailings by using the “opt-out” procedures described below – see the Choice/Opt-Out section below);

·                     Process your registration with the Site, such as verifying that your email address is active and valid;

·                     Contact you regarding the administration of your account, any services, features or functions you have enrolled in or registered to use, any promotions you have participated in or have entered, any goods and/or services or products you have ordered or any other transactions you have undertaken with the Site;

·                     Allow you to participate in the public areas, communities and/or other features of the Site;

·                     Respond to your questions or other requests;

·                     Contact you regarding your use of the Site, for informational purposes related to the Site or, in our discretion, regarding changes to the Site’s policies;

·                     Improve the Site or our services and for internal business purposes;

·                     Tailor your experience on the Site and/or otherwise customizing what you see when you visit the Site;

·                     Save your User ID or other Personal Information, so you don’t have to re-enter it each time you visit the Site;

·                     Otherwise to maintain and administer the Site; and

·                     For other purposes disclosed at the time you provide the Personal Information.

We may also collect other information about you which is not considered Personal Information (“Other Information”) in order to:

·                     Keep count of your return visits to the Site or Affiliates’, Advertisers’ or partners’ sites;

·                     Accumulate and report aggregate, statistical information in connection with the Site and user activity;

·                     Determine which features, webpages, products and services users like best to, among other things, help us operate the Site, enhance and improve our services and the Site and display advertising and marketing information;

·                     Prepare statistical reports;

·                     Allow you to participate in the public areas and/or other features of the Site;

·                     Improve the Site or our services and for internal business purposes;

·                     Tailor your experience on the Site and/or otherwise customizing what you see when you visit the Site;

·                     Save certain Other Information for use on your return visits to the Site;

·                     Otherwise to maintain and administer the Site; and

·                     For other purposes disclosed at the time you provide the Other Information.

**Targeted Advertising.**

In our role of delivering targeted advertisements, BET.com plays the middleman. Advertisers give us an advertisement and tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, males over 35 years old). BET.com takes the advertisement and displays it to users meeting those criteria. This kind of advertisement targeting is done with banner ads as well as promotional emails.

Additionally, BET.com uses 24/7 Real Media, Inc. and Doubleclick, Inc. (“Doubleclick”) as third party ad serving companies, to serve certain advertisements to you when you visit the Site.  These companies may use anonymous information related to your visit to the Site, such as the number of times you visited an advertisement, to better provide advertisements to you about goods and services that may be of interest to you. 

As always, we only authorize our third party ad serving companies to employ anonymous cookies for ad delivery and anonymous targeting.  Additionally, we do not give our third party ad serving companies any Personal Information about you.  If you would like more information about your ability to opt-out of the use of cookies, or to prevent our third party ad serving companies from setting and/or reading cookies on your computer, or to know more about their information gathering practices and procedures, you may visit each ad serving companies’ website and opt-out or visit the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) “Opt Out of Behavioral Advertising” tool to opt-out of all network advertising cookies.  Click on this link for the NAI gateway opt-out site: <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>.  


BET.com may use users’ IP address (the number assigned to your computer while it is on the Internet) for our internal purposes to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer the Site. In addition, your IP address is transmitted with each message sent from your account.  We may also store communicative information including, without limitation, instant messages and submissions to personal profiles or other social networking communications tools for the purpose of delivering and, if needed, monitoring communications.

Demographic and profile data from online forms or cookies may be used to tailor your experience at the Site, showing you content that we think you might be interested in, and displaying the content according to your preferences. This information may be shared with our Advertisers, business partners, or other companies only on an aggregate basis, unless you expressly state through an opt-out that demographic and profile information about you may not be disclosed.

**Public Forums.**

BET.com may make chat rooms, forums, message boards, personal webpages or other social networking or messaging features and/or news groups available to its users and, in certain cases, information contained in anonymous user profiles may be displayed on and shared with affiliated websites. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information, even without your consent.  You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your Personal Information because you don’t know who might access or attempt to use your posted Personal Information.  BET.com is in no way responsible for the accuracy, use, or misuse of any information (including Personal Information) that you disclose or receive through these venues.

**Choice/Opt-Out.**

BET.com gives you the following options for removing your Personal Information from our database in order to stop receiving future communications from BET.com.

1\. You can send email to: [contactus@bet.com](mailto:contactus@bet.com), or

3\. Upon receipt of any communication from BET.com, you can click on the ‘unsubscribe’ link to unsubscribe from future communications. (Please note: BET.com is not responsible for removing information from third-party lists or entities with which you have previously authorized us to share your information.)  Additionally, you may opt-out of sharing your information with third party lists or entities by either clearing the appropriate checkboxes at the point of initial collection or by following the procedures of the third party lists or entities.

Please note that BET.com or our Affiliates may continue to contact you after you have opted-out for administrative or informational purposes, including follow-up messages regarding the administration of your account, any services, features or functions you have enrolled in or registered to use, any promotions you have participated in or have entered, goods and/or services or products you have ordered, or other transactions you have undertaken with the Site.

**Children/Ineligible Teenagers.**

BET.com is a general audience site. We do not direct any of our content specifically at children under 13 years of age, and we do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from anyone under 13 years of age. If a parent or guardian believes that BET.com collected Personal Information from a child, please see the Review, Update or Delete Your Personal Information Section.  

In the event that we, or our parent companies, subsidiaries or Affiliates, unknowingly send an email or text message to a person that does not meet the age and other eligibility requirements of the Site, such as a child (a person under the age of 13) or others who do not meet the greater age requirements of certain features of this Site (“Ineligible Teenagers”), the child or Ineligible Teenager or the child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s parent or legal guardian (“Parents”) always has the right to unsubscribe (opt-out) from receiving future emails or text messages via the unsubscribe mechanism contained in the email or message. The same unsubscribe process is available to a parent or legal guardian of a minor (a person under the age of 18, or the age of majority in your state).

Parents of children or Ineligible Teenagers who wish to terminate their child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s membership must use their child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s User ID to gain direct access to the account and follow the procedures below.  To terminate a child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s membership, Parents may send an email to the Site’s Privacy Administrator at [legal@bet.com](mailto:legal@bet.com) and provide us with your child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s User ID and request to terminate your child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s account and registration. We will not allow direct access to a user’s account and Personal Information by any person without the user’s User ID. If a Parent does not have his or her child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s User ID, the Parent will be required to send an email to the Privacy Administrator at [legal@bet.com](mailto:legal@bet.com) that includes the Parent’s name, address, telephone and email address, in addition to the child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s name and email address as registered on the Site, plus the child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s date of birth. The Parent must also provide verifiable identification that he or she is the parent or legal guardian of the child or Ineligible Teenager. BET.com will send a confirming email to the Parent via the email address provided to verify that the Parent wishes to terminate his or her child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s account and registration. The Parent must then confirm by sending a reply email to the designated return address. BET.com will then terminate the child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s account but will notify the child or Ineligible Teenager of the termination request via email and will identify the name, address and email address of the person making the request.  

**Correcting/Updating Information.**

BET.com gives you the following options for informing us of changes to information you have previously provided:

1\. Email [contactus@bet.com](mailto:contactus@bet.com)

**Mobile Messaging and Communications.**

BET.com provides its valued users and viewers with the opportunity to register for special promotions, services, news, programming and information delivered via text, SMS, or other online or wireless messaging service (collectively, “Mobile Messages”), including messages sent from BET.com short code 79922. Users must opt-in to participate in Mobile Message programs either by registering on the Site or by sending a Mobile Message directly to short code 79922 (for example, text 106 to 79922 to receive important announcements from 106 & Park). All Mobile Messages from the BET.com short code are delivered by Vibes Media LLC.

Information requested as part of the online registration process is a user’s telephone number and/or wireless email address, but only if specifically requested, and the carrier’s name. Optional information may be requested for specific promotions, such as a user’s preferences regarding goods or services, choices of music or artists, or other similar survey information. Depending on the promotion, we may also collect an email address or other information and, depending on the information collected, the user may also be required to confirm his or her agreement to this Privacy Policy and/or the [Terms of Use Agreement](http://www.bet.com/terms-of-use.html). 

Users who register to receive Mobile Messages acknowledge that they understand and agree that carrier messaging and data rates may apply for all messages sent between the user and BET.com. Under no circumstances will BET.com, its parents, subsidiaries or any Affiliates be responsible for any Mobile Message charges incurred by a user or by a person having access to a user’s wireless device or telephone number.

We caution that most wireless transmissions are not secured and there is a greater risk of an unknown third party’s interception of messages or a user’s Personal Information when using a wireless Device. 

**a. Registration.** To the extent we provide wireless marketing services, there may be multiple registration methods provided for such services.

  
**b. Termination of Wireless Services.** Users may cancel a specific Mobile Messaging service at any time by using the unsubscribe mechanism provided by BET.com at the time a message is received.  Users may revoke their consent to receive all Mobile Messages from BET.com by sending a message with the phrase **STOP ALL** to short code **79922** or by **** sending an email to [mobile@bet.net](mailto:mobile@bet.net) .

**c. Termination of Wireless Services.** Users acknowledge that they understand and agree that BET.com and/or **** Vibes Media LLC **** may, at its or their sole discretion and without liability to any user, terminate a user’s offer of any specific wireless marketing service or all wireless marketing services at any time without advance notice. BET.com and/or Vibes Media LLC may provide notice of terminations or changes in service on this Site.  ****

**d. Use of Information.** BET.com will not use a wireless telephone number or email address, or other Personal Information submitted for its wireless marketing services for any other purpose but to provide the service requested, unless we provide advance notice of any other use or as stated in the Privacy Policy or the [Terms of Use Agreement](http://www.bet.com/terms-of-use.html). We will not share such Personal Information with Advertisers or other third party marketers unless you opt-in to such disclosure. **** We will share such Personal Information with the operational service providers (defined below) that assist us in delivering these wireless services to you and with our parent companies, subsidiaries, and Affiliates.

Some Device manufacturers may preset their browsers to block tracking technologies from websites other than those you visit directly and, if so, certain services or advertisements may not work for such Devices. Further, if you delete, reject, disable or turn off tracking technologies, you may not have access to certain features of the Site and some of our other services may not function properly. Please note that deleting, rejecting, disabling or turning off tracking technologies set by Advertisers and set by this Site through the above options will not remove flash cookies.

**Accuracy and Confidentiality.**

It is your responsibility to give us current, complete, truthful and accurate information, including Personal Information, and to keep such information up to date. We cannot and will not be responsible for any problems or liability that may arise if you do not give us accurate, truthful or complete information or Personal Information or you fail to update such information or Personal Information or contact the Privacy Administrator at [legal@bet.com](mailto:legal@bet.com).

We may share your Personal Information and Other Information with our Co-Branded Partner and your voluntary use of or participation in a co-branded service or feature means that you opt-in and give your affirmative consent to both the Site and our Co-Branded Partner to collect and use your Personal Information provided during the registration process and/or in connection with the specific co-branded feature or service for the fulfillment of the feature or service and for marketing or administrative purposes. If you wish to opt-out of a Co-Branded Partner’s future use of your Personal Information for marketing purposes, you will need to contact the Co-Branded Partner directly. The Co-Branded Partner will be identified on the co-branded feature or service. Registered or other users that participate in certain services relating to Submissions, such as user video uploads, agree to have certain Personal Information posted on the Site or other platforms or, if such feature is offered in connection with a Co-Branded Partner, on our Co-Branded Partner’s website in connection with the display of the uploaded video and posted on any platform that the uploaded video may be posted. Registered or other users that upload videos may also be required to submit additional Personal Information.

**Security & Protection of Personal Information.**

We maintain reasonable standards of security and confidentiality. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be 100% secure. For most Internet sites, it is possible that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications over an unsecured transmission. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, BET.com cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. ** **

  
**Review, Update or Delete Your Personal Information.**

Generally, you may review, update or delete your Personal Information collected by the Site.  You may also correct factual inaccuracies. However, Personal Information that is necessary to check eligibility, such as date of birth or age, cannot be deleted, but may be modified with sufficient verification of the correct information. Deletion or attempted deletion of certain Personal Information, such as your user name, may not be permitted and/or may result in suspension of your account or termination of any registration you may have made. 

Personal Information collected for certain entries are subject to corporate and regulatory record-keeping requirements and will not be deleted upon the user’s request, unless the entrant is a child under the age of 13 years old. 

Children under the age of 13 that are unknowingly registered on the Site are in violation of the [Terms of Use Agreement](http://www.bet.com/terms-of-use.html). Parents (including legal guardians) of children that registered on the Site in violation of the [Terms of Use Agreement](http://www.bet.com/terms-of-use.html) who wish to terminate their child’s membership must follow the steps for termination set forth in the section entitled Children/Ineligible Teenagers.

We reserve the right to deny access, use and registration privileges to any user, including without limitation, a registered user, of any services, features or functions of the Site if we believe there is a question about the identity of the person trying to access the user’s account or any services, features or functions. And, if the burden or expense of providing access to your Personal Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy, or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide access to such information. In such cases, we will provide to you an explanation of why access cannot be provided and contact information for further inquiries.
