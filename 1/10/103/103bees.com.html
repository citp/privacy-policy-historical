			<div>
			<p>At 103bees we recognize that privacy is most important. We value our clients’ trust 				  and confidence and are firmly committed to protecting the privacy of our 				  clients and the visitors to their websites. The following document covers 			  how 103bees treats client and visitor information that we gather.</p>
<p>Below you can find detailed information on when and why we collect personal 			     information, how we use it and the limited conditions under which we 			     may disclose it to others. We provide information on how 103bees handles 			     information gathered about visitors to sites tracked by 103bees (”Visitor 			     Information”) as well as information gathered from 103bees clients 			     who visit the 103bees website at http://103bees.com and use our service 			     to track their websites (”Client Information”).</p>
<h2>Privacy Policy for Use of Visitor Information</h2>
<p><strong>USE OF VISITOR INFORMATION</strong><br>
103bees clients use our service to track how visitors find our 			     clients’ websites in search engines and to evaluate and modify 			     their websites to ultimately increase search engine traffic. Our 			     clients use customized Javascript tracking codes provided by 103bees 			     to track information about their websites’ visitor activity. 			     In particular, the tracking codes collect Request- and Referrer-URL 			     information and stores it in a database at 103bees for use in performing 			     analysis and statistics reports for our clients. 103bees does not collect 			     any personal information such as names, addresses, phone numbers 			     or age about visitors to our clients’ websites.</p>
<p>Data collected this way is deleted 			     automatically after one month. We reserve a limited right to disclose 			     any data we collect if required by law or valid order of a court or other governmental authority. 			     103bees cannot be held responsible for its clients’ use of visitor information.</p>
<p><strong>USE OF COOKIES</strong><br>
Cookies are small amounts of data that are sent to visitors’ browsers 			     from our servers. They are eventually stored locally on visitors’ computer 			     hard drives. It is 103bees’ policy to use cookies for more accurate traffic 			     statistics. We do not store any personal information in cookies such 			     as names, email addresses or passwords.</p>
<h2>Privacy Policy for Use of Client Information</h2>
<p>103bees strongly believes in a client’s right to privacy and is committed 			     to protecting it. We want you to know that 103bees is not in the 			     business of selling or renting individuals’ personal data to other companies 			     for marketing purposes.</p>
<p><strong>CLIENT INFORMATION</strong><br>
All the information we collect about you and the visitors to your websites is considered confidential. Only authorized agents and users may access this information, which is protected by usernames and passwords. Although our service is designed to provide effective security, 103bees cannot be held responsible for unauthorized access to client accounts.</p>
<p><strong>PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong><br>
When clients register to the 103bees service we collect personal 			       information including email addresses, user names, passwords 			         and website URLs. This personal information allows 103bees to process and fulfill 			       requests to register new accounts. 103bees may release personal 		          information when we believe, in good faith, that such release 		          is reasonably necessary to (i) comply 			       with law, (ii) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements or (iii) 			       protect the rights, property or safety of 103bees, our users, or others.</p>
<p><strong>ACCESS TO CLIENT INFORMATION</strong><br>
At any time, clients may view and edit their personal information 			       that is stored in the 103bees database. Our clients may delete 			         their accounts from 103bees along with all information collected 			         at any time. 103bees will not access, modify, or otherwise 		          divulge information we gather except for the express purpose of generating 		          reports which have been authorized by you or otherwise agreed to by you, 			       or unless acting under a good faith belief that such action is 		          necessary to: (1) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (2) 			       protect and defend the rights or property of 103bees; (3) enforce our agreements 			       with clients and visitors; or (4) troubleshoot any service problems.</p>
<p><strong>USE OF COOKIES</strong><br>
Cookies are small amounts of data that are sent to visitors’ browsers 			     from our servers. They are eventually stored locally on visitors’ computer 			     hard drives. It is 103bees’ policy to use cookies for more accurate 			     traffic analysis and to maintain user sessions and we recommend 			     to set your browsers to accepting cookies while using the 103bees service. We do not 			     store any personal information in cookies such as names, e-mail addresses 			     or passwords. Cookies are used for maintaining user sessions only 			     and contain anonymous identifiers or session settings.</p>
<p><strong>USE OF CLIENT INFORMATION</strong><br>
103bees may use personal information submitted to us by clients 			       for communications related to the 103bees service. Because communications 			       with our clients are necessary to adequately provide our services, 			         clients cannot opt-out of receiving administrative e-mails. 		          Such e-mail may include confirmation of a registration or communication during the sales 			         or support process. Other e-mail communications are on an opt-in basis.</p>
<h2>Changes to the 103bees Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>103bees reserves the right to modify 			       its privacy policy at any time. If we make any material changes 			     to the way in which we use personal information, we will notify 			     you by e-mail. If you have any questions about this privacy statement, 			     the practices 			     of this website, or your dealings with 103bees, you are welcome 			     to contact us by:</p>
