# 103bees Privacy Policy

At 103bees we recognize that privacy is most important. We value our clients’ trust and confidence and are firmly committed to protecting the privacy of our clients and the visitors to their websites. The following document covers how 103bees treats client and visitor information that we gather.

Below you can find detailed information on when and why we collect personal information, how we use it and the limited conditions under which we may disclose it to others. We provide information on how 103bees handles information gathered about visitors to sites tracked by 103bees (”Visitor Information”) as well as information gathered from 103bees clients who visit the 103bees website at http://103bees.com and use our service to track their websites (”Client Information”).

## Privacy Policy for Use of Visitor Information

**USE OF VISITOR INFORMATION**  
103bees clients use our service to track how visitors find our clients’ websites in search engines and to evaluate and modify their websites to ultimately increase search engine traffic. Our clients use customized Javascript tracking codes provided by 103bees to track information about their websites’ visitor activity. In particular, the tracking codes collect Request- and Referrer-URL information and stores it in a database at 103bees for use in performing analysis and statistics reports for our clients. 103bees does not collect any personal information such as names, addresses, phone numbers or age about visitors to our clients’ websites.

Data collected this way is deleted automatically after one month. We reserve a limited right to disclose any data we collect if required by law or valid order of a court or other governmental authority. 103bees cannot be held responsible for its clients’ use of visitor information.

**USE OF COOKIES**  
Cookies are small amounts of data that are sent to visitors’ browsers from our servers. They are eventually stored locally on visitors’ computer hard drives. It is 103bees’ policy to use cookies for more accurate traffic statistics. We do not store any personal information in cookies such as names, email addresses or passwords.

## Privacy Policy for Use of Client Information

103bees strongly believes in a client’s right to privacy and is committed to protecting it. We want you to know that 103bees is not in the business of selling or renting individuals’ personal data to other companies for marketing purposes.

**CLIENT INFORMATION**  
All the information we collect about you and the visitors to your websites is considered confidential. Only authorized agents and users may access this information, which is protected by usernames and passwords. Although our service is designed to provide effective security, 103bees cannot be held responsible for unauthorized access to client accounts.

**PERSONAL INFORMATION**  
When clients register to the 103bees service we collect personal information including email addresses, user names, passwords and website URLs. This personal information allows 103bees to process and fulfill requests to register new accounts. 103bees may release personal information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with law, (ii) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements or (iii) protect the rights, property or safety of 103bees, our users, or others.

**ACCESS TO CLIENT INFORMATION**  
At any time, clients may view and edit their personal information that is stored in the 103bees database. Our clients may delete their accounts from 103bees along with all information collected at any time. 103bees will not access, modify, or otherwise divulge information we gather except for the express purpose of generating reports which have been authorized by you or otherwise agreed to by you, or unless acting under a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of 103bees; (3) enforce our agreements with clients and visitors; or (4) troubleshoot any service problems.

**USE OF COOKIES**  
Cookies are small amounts of data that are sent to visitors’ browsers from our servers. They are eventually stored locally on visitors’ computer hard drives. It is 103bees’ policy to use cookies for more accurate traffic analysis and to maintain user sessions and we recommend to set your browsers to accepting cookies while using the 103bees service. We do not store any personal information in cookies such as names, e-mail addresses or passwords. Cookies are used for maintaining user sessions only and contain anonymous identifiers or session settings.

**USE OF CLIENT INFORMATION**  
103bees may use personal information submitted to us by clients for communications related to the 103bees service. Because communications with our clients are necessary to adequately provide our services, clients cannot opt-out of receiving administrative e-mails. Such e-mail may include confirmation of a registration or communication during the sales or support process. Other e-mail communications are on an opt-in basis.
