		  The security of your data also depends on you. You are responsible for keeping your password confidential. It is also recommended to not use the same password you have used on other websites. We will never ask for your password so be careful about giving this information out in public areas like message boards.

		  Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not 100% secure. We cannot guarantee the security of your data on the Site as it may be vulnerable to hackers or hardware failure. Although we do backup our database regularly, any transmission of personal data is at your own risk. 10KHits will not be responsible for any damages done.
