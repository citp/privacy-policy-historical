<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>10gen, Inc. is committed to protecting your privacy. We have prepared this
Privacy Policy to describe to you our practices regarding the Personal Data (as
defined below) we collect from users of our website located at 10gen.com and in
connection with our MongoDB products and related products and services (the
"Products").</p>

<h2>1. User Consent.</h2>
<p>By submitting Personal Data through our website or
Products, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly
consent to the processing of your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy
Policy.</p>

<h2>2. A Note About Children.</h2>
<p>We do not intentionally gather Personal Data
about visitors who are under the age of 13.</p>

<h2>3. A Note To Users Outside Of The United States.</h2>
<p>Your Personal Data may
be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries,
including the United States, where laws regarding processing of Personal Data
may be less stringent than the laws in your country. We adhere to the United
States / European Union <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor">Data
  Protection Safe Harbor Arrangement</a>.</p>

<h2>4. Types Of Data We Collect.</h2>
<p>We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data
from you when you visit our site, when you send us information or
communications, when you download and use our Products, and when you register
for white papers, web seminars, and other events hosted by us. "Personal Data"
means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for
example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any
other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any
of the foregoing data. "Anonymous Data" means data that is not associated with
or linked to your Personal Data; Anonymous Data does not permit the
identification of individual persons.</p>

<h3>4.1 Personal Data You Provide to Us.</h3>
<p>We collect Personal Data from you,
such as your first and last name, gender, e-mail and mailing addresses,
professional title, company name, and password when you download and install
the Products, create an account to log in to our network, or sign-up for our
newsletter or other marketing material. When you order Products on our website,
we will collect all information necessary to complete the transaction,
including your name, credit card information, billing information and shipping
information. We also retain information on your behalf, such as files and
messages that you store using your account. If you provide us feedback or
contact us via e-mail or submit a response to an employment opportunity posted
on our website, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any
other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply, and any
information that you submit to us, such as a resume. When you participate in
one of our surveys, we may collect additional profile information. When you
post messages on the message boards of our website, the information contained
in your posting will be stored on our servers and other users will be able to
see it. We also collect other types of Personal Data that you provide to us
voluntarily, such as operating system and version, Product version numbers, and
other requested information if you contact us via e-mail regarding support for
the Products. We may also collect Personal Data, such as demographic
information, from you via the Products or at other points in our website that
state that Personal Data is being collected.</p>

<h3>4.2 Personal Data Collected via Technology.</h3>
<p>To make our website and
Products more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party
service provider) collect Personal Data from you, including browser type,
operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is
automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may
vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your
visit. We also use Cookies (as defined below) and navigational data like
Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and
time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and
which you viewed. Like most technology companies, we automatically gather this
Personal Data and store it in log files each time you visit our website or
access your account on our network. "Cookies" are small pieces of information
that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a web
site. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web
browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete
them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our
website. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help
file directions. If you choose to disable Cookies, some areas of our website
may not work properly.</p>

<h3>4.3 Personal Data That We Collect from You About Others.</h3>
<p>If you decide to
create an account for and invite a third party to join our network, we will
collect your and the third party's names and e-mail addresses in order to send
an e-mail and follow up with the third party. You or the third party may
contact us at <a href="mailto:info@10gen.com">info@10gen.com</a> to request the
removal of this information from our database.</p>

<h2>5. Use Of Your Data</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>5.1 General Use.</h3>
<p>In general, Personal Data you submit to us is used
either to respond to requests that you make, or to aid us in serving you
better. We use your Personal Data in the following ways: to facilitate the
creation of and secure your account on our network; identify you as a user in
our system; provide improved administration of our website and Products;
improve the quality of experience when you interact with our website and
Products; send you a welcome e-mail to verify ownership of the e-mail address
provided when your account was created; send you administrative e-mail
notifications, such as security or support and maintenance advisories; respond
to your inquiries related to employment opportunities or other requests; to
send promotional communications; to provide you with hardcopy or electronic
newsletters or surveys; to send upgrades and offers related to our Products;
and for other our, or our Third Party Company (as defined below), marketing
purposes should you opt-in to receive such communications by following the
instructions we provide; to make telephone calls to you, from time to time, as
a part of secondary fraud protection or to solicit your feedback.</p>

<h3>5.2 Creation of Anonymous Data.</h3>
<p>We may create Anonymous Data records from
Personal Data by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the data
personally identifiable to you. We use this Anonymous Data to analyze request
and usage patterns so that we may enhance the content of our Products and
improve site navigation. We reserve the right to use and disclose Anonymous
Data to Third Party Companies in our discretion.</p>

<h3>5.3 Feedback.</h3>
<p>If you provide feedback on any of our Products or our
website, we may use such feedback for any purpose, provided we will not
associate such feedback with your Personal Data. We will collect any
information contained in such communication and will treat the Personal Data in
such communication in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>6. Disclosure Of Your Personal Data</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>6.1 Affiliates.</h3>
<p>Although we currently do not have a parent company, any
subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control
(collectively, "Affiliates"), we may in the future. We may share some or all of
your Personal Data with these Affiliates, in which case we will require our
Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy. If another company acquires us or our
assets, that company will possess the Personal Data collected by it and us and
will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Data as
described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>6.2 Other Disclosures.</h3>
<p>Regardless of any choices you make regarding your
Personal Data (as described below), we may disclose Personal Data if we believe
in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant
laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; (b) protect or defend
the our rights or property or the rights or property of users of the Products;
or (c) protect against fraud and reduce credit risk.</p>

<h2>7. Third Parties</h2>

<h3>7.1 Personal and/or Anonymous Data Collected by Third Parties.</h3>

<p><strong>(a)</strong> We may receive Personal and/or Anonymous Data about you from other
sources like telephone or fax, or from companies that provide our Products by
way of a co-branded or private-labeled website or companies that offer their
products and/or services on our website ("Third Party Companies"). Our Third
Party Companies may supply us with Personal Data, such as your calendars and
address book information, in order to help us establish the account. We may add
this information to the information we have already collected from you via our
website in order to improve the Products we provide.</p>

<p><strong>(b)</strong> Our provision of a link to any other website or location, such as the
Google Checkout™ payment processing websites, is for your convenience and
does not signify our endorsement of such other website or location or its
contents. When you click on such a link, you will leave our site and go to
another site. During this process, another entity may collect Personal Data or
Anonymous Data from you.</p>

<p><strong>(c)</strong> We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible
for, these outside websites or their content. Please be aware that the terms of
this Privacy Policy do not apply to these outside websites or content, or to
any collection of data after you click on links to such outside websites. You
may determine whether or not we are responsible for the content of a website by
reviewing the URL and confirming the ownership of the applicable domain by
means of a service such as <a href="http://www.dnsstuff.com">DNSstuff.com</a>.</p>

<h3>7.2 Disclosure to Third Party Service Providers.</h3>
<p>Except as otherwise
stated in this policy, we do not generally sell, trade, share, or rent the
Personal Data collected from our services to other entities. However, we may
share your Personal Data with third party service providers to provide you with
the Products that we offer you through our website; to conduct quality
assurance testing; to facilitate creation of accounts; to provide technical
support; or to provide specific services, such as synchronization with other
software applications. These third party service providers are required not to
use your Personal Data other than to provide the services requested by us. You
expressly consent to the sharing of your Personal Data with our contractors and
other service providers for the sole purpose of providing services to you.</p>

<h3>7.3 Disclosure to Third Party Companies.</h3>
<p>We may enter into agreements
with Third Party Companies. A Third Party Company may want access to Personal
Data that we collect from our customers. As a result, we may disclose your
Personal Data to a Third Party Company; however, we will not disclose your
Personal Data to Third Party Companies for the Third Party Companies' own
direct marketing purposes, unless you have "opted-in" by following the
instructions we provide to allow such disclosure. If you have opted-in to
receive e-mail communications from a Third Party Company and later wish to
discontinue receipt of these e-mails, please contact the Third Party Company
directly to update your preferences. The privacy policies of our Third Party
Companies may apply to the use and disclosure of your Personal Data that we
collect and disclose to such Third Party Companies. Because we do not control
the privacy practices of our Third Party Companies, you should read and
understand their privacy policies.</p>

<h2>8. Your Choices Regarding Your Personal Data</h2>

<h3>8.1 Choices.</h3>
<p>We offer you choices regarding the collection, use, and
sharing of your Personal Data. We will periodically send you free newsletters
and e-mails that directly promote the use of our site or the purchase of our
Products and may contain advertisements for Third Party Companies. When you
receive newsletters or promotional communications from us, you may indicate a
preference to stop receiving further communications from us and you will have
the opportunity to "opt-out" by following the unsubscribe instructions provided
in the e-mail you receive or by contacting us directly (please see contact
information below). Should you decide to opt-out of receiving future mailings,
we may share your e-mail address with third parties to ensure that you do not
receive further communications from third parties. Despite your indicated
e-mail preferences, we may send you notices of any updates to our Privacy
Policy.</p>

<h3>8.2 Changes to Personal Data.</h3>
<p>You may change any of your Personal Data in
your account by sending an e-mail to us at the e-mail address set forth below.
You may request deletion of your Personal Data by us, but please note that we
may be required (by law or otherwise) to keep this information and not delete
it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will
comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such
requirements). When we delete any information, it will be deleted from the
active database, but may remain in our archives.</p>

<h2>9. Security Of Your Personal Data.</h2>
<p>We are committed to protecting the
security of your Personal Data. We use a variety of industry-standard security
technologies and procedures to help protect your Personal Data from
unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We also require you to enter a
password to access your account information. Please do not disclose your
account password to unauthorized people. Despite these measures, you should
know that we cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with Personal
Data and mistakes may happen.</p>

occasional revision, and if we make any substantial changes in the way we use
your Personal Data, we will notify you by sending you an e-mail to the last

immediately for new users of our website and Products. Please note that at all
times you are responsible for updating your Personal Data to provide us with
your most current e-mail address. In the event that the last e-mail address
that you have provided us is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of
delivering to you the notice described above, our dispatch of the e-mail
containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice of the
changes described in the notice. In any event, changes to this Privacy Policy
may affect our use of Personal Data that you provided us prior to our
notification to you of the changes. If you do not wish to permit changes in our
use of your Personal Data, you must notify us prior to the effective date of
the changes that you wish to deactivate your account with us. Continued use of
our website or Products, following notice of such changes shall indicate your
acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and
conditions of such changes.</p>
