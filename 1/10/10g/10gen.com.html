Privacy Policy</h3><h4>Disclaimer &amp; Privacy Policy</h4><p>The information we collect through our Site helps us provide you with information specific to your needs and interests. This privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") covers the 10gen website (the "Site"). Please read below to review our Privacy Policy and the types of information we gather through our Site. In this Privacy Policy, "we", "us", "our" and other similar references mean 10gen. Inc. ("10gen") and "you" and "your" and other similar references mean a specific user of the Site. By visiting the Site, you accept the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p><h4>General</h4><p>10gen may collect personally identifiable information such as: your name, contact data such as your address, email address, phone number, username, password, language choice, time zone, employment title and company information, credit card information or other payment information, credit history information, tax identification number and reseller identification number; and other information that you voluntarily transmit with your communication to us.</p><p>Additionally, 10gen may collect personally identifiable information about users that users provide to 10gen when users contact 10gen or that users voluntarily post in blogs, chat rooms, forums, message boards available from the Site and other users will be able to see any information that users post to such forums and 10gen is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums. 10gen also may collect the foregoing personally identifiable information about users from our third party affiliates or partner companies and from marketing or advertising companies that provide 10gen with such information as a part of their relationship with 10gen. 10gen also may collect information about users, the data users upload to the Services and general use of the Site and Services through direct use of the Site and Services.</p><p>10gen may utilize user's personally identifiable information to register user to use the Services and/or certain sections of the Site, contact user to deliver certain products, services or information such as a newsletter user has requested, verify users' authority to enter the Site, verify users' authority to use the Services, improve the content and general administration of the Site and the Services, provide user with notices regarding goods or services that user has purchased or may wish to purchase in the future, facilitate user ratings and consistent user identity, internal business analysis, and for targeted advertising.</p><h4>Specific Use of Information</h4><p>(i) Cookies. Cookies are pieces of data assigned by a web server that uniquely identify the browser on your computer. Websites typically use temporary cookies called "session" cookies to ensure that you are recognized when you move from page to page within one site and that any information you have entered is remembered. Websites also use cookies called "persistent" cookies to enable a website to remember you on subsequent visits, speeding up or enhancing your experience of services or functions offered. 10gen attempts to install both persistent and session cookies when a user arrives at our Site. Cookies enable our systems to gather information about your navigational patterns through the site. Viewers have the option to accept or disable cookies at any time through their browsers. Visit the "help" portion of your toolbar for more information. If you block or refuse to accept cookies, or delete cookies between visits to the site, you may not be able to access or use certain features or functions of our Site.</p><p>(ii) Server Statistics. We collect general statistics to track user trends on our Site. These statistics include hits to our server, the types of browsers used to access our Site, page views, and navigational patterns. The information that is collected in this manner does NOT provide us with any personally identifiable information about our users. It helps us track "where" our users are coming from. This allows us to pinpoint high traffic areas and determine the most effective ways to communicate with our users. As part of that ongoing analysis, 10gen also uses devices called "web beacons" to help us identify when emails sent to you have been received and read. In order to prevent the introduction of viruses and hackers into the 10gen site we may collect information, such as IP addresses, into a log file to be used to identify potential hackers of the 10gen site.</p><p>(iii) Personal Information You Provide Us. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" is any information that identifies you, would enable someone to contact you, or that describes your relationship with 10gen. We collect and store Personal Information when (including but not limited to) you register to use our Site, ask a question, post a comment, complete a form, conduct a transaction, or send us an email. While you are not required to submit any information to our Site, if you do not provide the requested information, you may not be able to access or use some of the features and functions of our Site and we may not be able to provide you with certain services. </p><h4>Security </h4><p>We use physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to assist us in preventing unauthorized access, maintaining data accuracy, and correctly using your Personal Information. Except as specified in this Privacy Policy, we use commercially reasonable efforts to limit access to your Personal Information to the employees, agents, and officers of 10gen who need the information for their jobs.</p><h4>Disclosure of Information </h4><p>10gen may share information with carefully selected vendors and business partners with whom we work. All companies that act on our behalf are contractually obligated to keep all information confidential and to use the customer information only to provide the services we ask them to perform for you and us. We may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third party vendors, but these statistics do not include Personal Information. We may disclose Personal Information we collect from you if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that disclosure is necessary (a) to obey the law or comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates; (b) to protect and defend our rights or property or the rights or property of other users of our Site; or (c) to act in an emergency to protect the personal safety of users of our Site or the public.</p><h4>External Links</h4><p>We are not responsible for how these other companies or organizations collect, use, disclose, or secure the information that you provide them. If you choose to access a third party Site linked to our Site, you do so at your own risk and subject to any terms of service or privacy policy (if any) associated with such third party Sites.</p><h4>Collection Of Information From Children</h4><p>10gen does not direct any of our content specifically to children. Users of our Site are required to be at least 18 years old, and any user under 18 is not an authorized user. If we learn that a user is under thirteen (13) years of age, we will promptly delete any Personal Information we have collected about that user.</p><h4>Consent To Processing In The United States</h4><p>By providing any Personal Information to 10gen, all users, including, without limitation, users in Canada and the member states of the European Union, fully understand and unambiguously consent to this Privacy Policy and to the transfer of such Personal Information across international borders in accordance with 10gen's standard operations, including the collection, storage, and processing of such information in the United States of America.</p><h4>Modification And Notification Of Changes</h4><p>10gen may at our sole discretion edit this Privacy Policy. </p><h4>Summary</h4><p>10gen is committed to protecting your privacy. The information collected from our Site helps us better understand our market and consumer interests. This allows us to serve our customers and business associates with the level of satisfaction they deserve.</p><p>If you have questions or suggestions regarding this Privacy Policy or our privacy practices please send an email message to <a href="mailto:info@10gen.com">info@10gen.com</a>.</p><h4>Historical Modifications</h4><p>7/20/2008: Initial version posted</p>  </div>
