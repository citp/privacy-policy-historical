**Why Did You Receive An Email From Us?**

**Usage and Sharing**

We do not sell, share, or rent individual personal information with anyone without your advance written permission or unless ordered by a court of law. 

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [click here](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html). For example, Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on your site. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and other sites on the Internet.

We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. Information submitted to us is only available to employees managing this information, for purposes of contacting you or sending you emails based on your request for information and to contracted service providers for purposes of providing services relating to our communications with you. We may transfer the information that you have provided to us if 101cookbooks.com is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, 101cookbooks.com will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
