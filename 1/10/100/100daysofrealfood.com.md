100 Days of Real Food’s Privacy Policy is designed to help you (“User”) understand how we collect and use the personal information you decide to share, and help you make informed decisions when using our Web Site located at www.100daysofrealfood.com  (“WebSite”).

By using or accessing our Web Site, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us at policy{at}100daysofrealfood{dot}com. You are also encouraged to read our [Terms of Use](https://www.100daysofrealfood.com/terms-of-use/)

The Web Site is intended for use by persons 18 years and older. 100 Days of Real Food does not knowingly collect any information about children under the age of thirteen.

### Use And Disclosure Of Information

We will never share your email address or other private information with anyone without your permission.

If it is necessary to provide a service to you, we may request that you provide us with contact information sufficient to provide the service.  An example would be if you won a giveaway and the manufacturer needed to contact you to set up direct delivery (in which case permission is implied through participation in the contest).

100 Days of Real Food only shares personal information with third parties when we have a good faith belief that sharing the information is necessary to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Terms of Use including investigation of potential violations thereof; detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; or protect the rights, property, or safety of 100 Days of Real Food, our Users, or others.  We do not sell, rent, share, or otherwise disclose personal information from Users for any commercial purpose. You will see a list of our third party service providers throughout this Privacy Policy.

100 Days of Real Food’s service provider (“Service Provider”) uses security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of information under our control.  We store information in databases located in secured data centers with live personnel monitoring 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Data security is paramount, and our Service Provider is constantly re-evaluating and deploying, where appropriate, the latest technologies to enhance our security and the confidentiality of personal information.

We personally take additional security measures to block unauthorized access to our web platform including secure socket layer encryption, strong passwords, 2-step verification, and code to block brute force password cracking.
