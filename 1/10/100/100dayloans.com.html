            <strong>1.	U.S. GOVERNING LAW</strong>
            <br>
            <br>

            The Website is designed and targeted to U.S. audiences and is governed by and operated in accordance
            with the laws of the U.S. Acquisition Media makes no representation that this Website is operated
            in accordance with the laws or regulations of, or governed by, other nations.
            <br>

            of any Personal Information you provide to the Website; (2) acknowledge that U.S. law provides a

            <br>

            Acquisition Media does not solicit or knowingly collect personally identifiable information from
            children under the age of 13. If Acquisition Media obtains actual knowledge that it has collected
            personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 13, Acquisition Media will immediately
            delete such information from its database. Because Acquisition Media does not collect personally identifiable

            to third parties.
            <br>
            <br>

            <a name="privacy3">&nbsp; </a>
            <strong>3.	INFORMATION COLLECTION PRACTICES</strong>
            <br>
            <br>

            (a)	Traffic Data.  Like most website operators, Acquisition Media automatically gathers information of the
            sort that browsers automatically make available, including: (i) Internet Protocol (IP) addresses; (ii) domain
            servers; (iii) types of computers accessing the Website; (iv) types of Web browsers accessing the Website;
            and (v) full Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") click stream data, including referring URLs, date and time, and
            content viewed or searched for on the Website (collectively "Traffic Data").  Traffic Data is anonymous
            information that does not personally identify you.
            <br>
            <br>

            (b)	Cookies.  A "Cookie" is a string of information that a website stores on a user's computer, and that
            the user's browser provides to the website each time the user submits a query to the website.  The purpose
            of a Cookie is to identify the user as a unique user of the Website.  Acquisition Media uses "session" cookies
            to collect information about your use of the Website and to give you a more personalized browsing experience
            and help you navigate the Website more efficiently from page to page. These cookies are temporary and are
            deleted when you close your browser. Acquisition Media uses "persistent" cookies to gather statistical
            information about repeat usage from your computer or workstation. For additional information on Acquisition
            Media' uses of Cookies, see the section concerning Information Use and Disclosure Practices/Traffic Data
            and Information Gathered Using Cookies and Web Beacons, below.
            <br>
            <br>

            IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO HAVE COOKIES PLACED ON YOUR COMPUTER, YOU SHOULD SET YOUR BROWSERS TO REFUSE COOKIES
            BEFORE ACCESSING THE WEBSITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT CERTAIN OF THE SERVICES AND CERTAIN FEATURES OF
            THE WEBSITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF COOKIES.  IF YOU REFUSE COOKIES, YOU ASSUME ALL
            RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY.
            <br>
            <br>

            (c)	Web Beacons. "Web Beacons" (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs) are tiny graphics with
            a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users
            or to access Cookies. Unlike Cookies which are stored on the user's computer hard drive, Web Beacons are
            embedded invisibly on web pages (or in e-mail). Web Beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with Cookies,
            to count users who have visited certain pages and to understand usage patterns. For additional information on
            Acquisition Media' uses of Web Beacons, see the section concerning Information Use and Disclosure
            Practices/Traffic Data and Information Gathered Using Cookies &amp; Web Beacons, below.
            <br>
            <br>

            (d)	Ad Serving. Acquisition Media uses third-parties for advertising and analytics for pages that we host.
            These third-parties may place Cookies on your machine, use Web Beacons, gather Personal Information, gather
            IP addresses and log data to collect traffic and activity data in order to deliver relevant metrics, content,
            and advertising. The collection of this information by third-parties are subject to such third-parties'
            privacy policies.  For additional information, see the section concerning Third-Party Websites, below.
            <br>
            <br>

            (e)	Personal Information. During the loan application process, you will be asked to provide Acquisition Media
            certain information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information"). Personal Information includes,
            without limitation: (1) "Identity/Contact Data" (such as your name, address, email address, social security
            number, driver's license or state ID number, your employer and your employer's address); (2) "Financial
            Information" (such as your bank, bank address, bank phone number, bank account type, length of time with your bank,
            your ABA routing number and your account number); (3 ) "Demographic Data" (such as your birthday, city/town, zip code,
            state, home ownership status, employment history, pay period frequency, next pay period and monthly income). In each
            case, you will be asked to provide Personal Information; the Website will not gather it surreptitiously. BY PROVIDING
            FINANCIAL ACCOUNT NUMBERS AND SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS, YOU THEREBY EXPRESSLY CONSENT THE COLLECTION BY ACQUISTION MEDIA
            OF SUCH INFORMATION. Acquisition Media may supplement the Personal Information you provide with additional Personal
            Information gathered from public sources or from third-parties (e.g., consumer reporting agencies, third-party service
            providers, etc.) who may lawfully provide such information to Acquisition Media.
