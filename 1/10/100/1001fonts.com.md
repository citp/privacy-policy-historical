# Privacy Policy · 1001 Fonts

1001 Fonts is committed to protecting the privacy of its users and so this policy points out which user-data is collected and who has access to them.

## First-Party Cookies

1001 Fonts may serve up to three first-party cookies for the .1001fonts.com domain: A unique (psydonymized) _sessionID_ cookie to recognize visitors across pages, an optional _rememberMe_ cookie to to recognize returning signed in users and last a non-personal _browsing_ cookie for saving selected browsing preferences such as desired font preview size, color or fonts per page.

## User Registration

Users can [sign up for a registered account](https://web.archive.org/sign-up.html). The given password is stored in a salted, one-way repetitively encrypted hash and can not be restored. The submitted email address is not published and only visible to the owner within his/her user profile. This preference can later be changed by the user at free will. An MD5 hash of the email address is however publicly used for obtaining an avatar from [gravatar.com](http://www.gravatar.com/).

## User Generated Content

Signed in users are able to generate and publish certain content, such as posting to a forum or commenting on a font or even publishing a font. The visibility/privacy of such content may vary and is usually marked with icons:

__= Visible to everyone on the Internet  
__= Visible to font authors only  
__= Visible to signed in users only  
__= Visible to the content owner only

Email addresses published within public content are encrypted in a format hopefully not readable by spambots. In case of legitimate incoming copyright inquiries regarding user generated content, the user's email address may be used to enabling direct communication between 1001 Fonts and the two parties to hopefully help resolve any issues.

## Analytics

1001 Fonts uses [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html) to analyze its traffic, which makes use of (unique) cookies as well. IP-addresses get anonymized. You can opt out of our Google Analytics data collection by using the tools available [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).
