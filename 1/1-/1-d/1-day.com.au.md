[back to help](https://web.archive.org/help.do)

1-day has put together the following privacy statement to display 1-days commitment to provide privacy. This document will display the policies 1-day has put in place to protect customers during information gathering practices.

**Use of your information**  
1-day **does not** sell or rent your personal information to third parties.  
We will only release account and other personal information if we believe release is appropriate to comply with law; facilitate court proceedings; enforce or apply our terms and conditions; or protect the rights, property, or safety of 1-day Limited, our users, or others.

**Email**  
It is the policy of 1-day to send our members emails throughout the purchasing process and other Newsletter emails they elect to receive. Further, it is our policy to immediately remove any member from any mailing list upon the member's request. In addition, 1-day will send out promotional material to its Newsletters subscribers promoting material related to 1-day.  
We do use email as a means of receiving feedback from our members, and we encourage you to [email us](https://web.archive.org/contactUs.do) with your questions or comments.

**Emailing Tools** 1-day provides tools on its web site to tell a friend about products, send vouchers and re-send order invoices. These tools must not be misused in any way to send spam or other content which would violate our privacy policy or Terms and Conditions.

**Spam**  
Occasionally we receive reports from some of our customers that they believe our email database has been compromised and we are leaking their email addresses to spammers. Some of these customers have set up an email address that is only used for our emails and they cannot understand why they are receiving spam emails as well.  
We have never and will never give out our customers email address or account details. We consider the practise to be both immoral and illegal. We are continuously monitoring our client database through our email service provider to ensure that it continues to be safe and secure..  
We continue to consult with a number of email service providers to ensure that we keep on top of this issue as it is very important to us. The best information we have received so far is that this spam is the result of a directory harvest attack. This is a common method employed by spammers to grow their databases for a future spam campaign. Directory harvest attacks combine a dictionary of common names (including first names, surnames, company names) with a list of domain names. The spammers then send emails to these addresses and logs any address that does not reply with a delivery failure (automated by recipients email server).

According to the Message Anti-Abuse Working Group, the amount of spam email accounts for between 88-91% of email messages sent during the last half of 2010. [Click here](http://www.maawg.org/email_metrics_report) for more info...  
We want to assure our customers that we will continue to monitor this area and take every step to ensure that their email addresses are not compromised or leaked.
