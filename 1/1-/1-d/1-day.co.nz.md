We may disclose your personal information to our employees, for the operation of our websites or our business, and for the specific purpose of fulfilling requests by you, and to provide products and services to you, and where we are permitted to under the Privacy Act.

Government agencies with statutory roles enabling them to request data from us include but are not restricted to the Police, Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.

  11.  **HOW CAN YOU ACCESS OR CORRECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?**



You may request access to any personal information we hold about you at any time by contacting us.

Your request will be processed in accordance with the Privacy Act 1993.

If you make an access request, we will ask you to verify your identity. There may be instances where we cannot grant you access to the personal information we hold. For example, we may need to refuse access if granting access would interfere with the privacy of others, or if it would result in a breach of confidentiality. If that happens, in most circumstances we will give you written reasons for any refusal.

If you believe that personal information we hold about you is incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate, then you may request us to amend it. We will consider if the information requires amendment and will not charge for making any amendments. If we do not agree that there are grounds for amendment, then we will add a note to the personal information stating that you disagree with it. Registered users of our websites can access and update their user details online. We request that you keep your information as current as possible so that we may continue to improve our service to you.

  12.  **HOW CAN YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT A BREACH OF PRIVACY?**



  
If you believe your privacy has been breached by us, or have any questions or concerns about our Privacy Policy please, contacting us and provide details of the incident so that we can investigate it.

We have a formal procedure for investigating and dealing with complaints. Once we receive a complaint in writing we will commence an investigation with the relevant business unit from which the alleged breach stemmed. The investigator will endeavour to determine the nature of the breach and how it occurred.

We may contact you during the process to seek any further clarification if necessary. If a breach is found, we will escalate the matter to management so that the process can be rectified to prevent any further breaches from taking place. We will also contact you to inform you of the outcome of the investigation. We will endeavour to resolve all investigations within a reasonable time.

We will treat your requests or complaints confidentially. Our representative will contact you within a reasonable time after receipt of your complaint to discuss your concerns and outline options regarding how they may be resolved. We will aim to ensure that your complaint is resolved in a timely and appropriate manner.

  16.  **CREDIT CARD SECURITY**



  
We work diligently to protect the security of your personal information, including credit card information.

Your credit card details do not get stored, processed or transmitted through 1-day?s website; all transactions are processed through Payment Express. Payment Express is a secure credit card payment service provided by Direct Payment Solutions, and they host and manage the payment page. All transaction sessions are stored and processed in encrypted strings. You can review their privacy policy here.

Due to the nature of our business being online retail we have a number of security checks in place to protect our website and our customers from such things as credit card theft. Our order system will automatically put orders on hold if it includes such things as high valued items or if a transaction has failed. To release your order you may be asked for Identification and proof of address so your order can be approved. Once checked and approved any proof of identity information collected in relation to your order will be deleted and you will be contacted by email to confirm that this has been done. Due to these checks your delivery may also be delayed
