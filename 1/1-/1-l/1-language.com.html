        <p align="center"><b>Information Collection and Use</b><br>
        </p>
        <p><b>Information Collection</b><br>
          ------------------------------<br>
        </p>
        <p><b>Registration</b><br>
          Registration is not required to use this site, with the exception of 
          the Video Center section where a user must first complete the registration 
          form. During registration a user is required to give contact information 
          including a username, password, and valid email address. We do not use 
          this information, but it is passed on to RealEnglisn.com to contact 
          the user about services on their site for which the user has expressed 
          interest. 1-language.com also has Discussion Forums which have optional 
          registration. For more details see "Profile" below.</p>
        <p> <br>
          <b>Information Use</b><br>
          All information collected by 1-language.com is of a non-personal nature 
          except the Discussion Forums and the Video Center. 1-language.com records 
          aggregate information such as number of users, location, server type, 
          and method of arriving at 1-language.com. The Discussion Forums allow 
          users to optionally register information such as username, password, 
          location, and interests. This information is not sold or given to third 
          parties under any circumstances. The Discussion Forums are run using 
          PHPBB2 software which uses a MySQL database, and so present a very small 
          security risk from hacking attempts. The Video Center requires a valid 
          email address, username and password which are not used by 1-language.com, 
          but are passed on to RealEnglish.com. </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p><b>Profile</b><br>
          1-language.com collects profiles from our discussion forums which use 
          PHPBB2 software. Registration for these forums is not required, and 
          if a users chooses to register only an email address is required. Users 
          may also provide information such as location, occupation, interests 
          and contact information.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p><b>Cookies</b><br>
          A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user¡¯s computer 
          tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked 
          to any personally identifiable information while on our site. We use 
          both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session 
          ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. 
          A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user¡¯s 
          hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be 
          removed by following Internet browser help file directions. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, 
          advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, 
          once we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising. 
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p><b>Third Party Advertising</b><br>
          1-language.com currently has no third party advertising.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by 1-language.com 
          only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p><b>Log Files</b><br>
          Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes 
          internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider 
          (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number 
          of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user¡¯s 
          movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information 
          for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable 
          information. [IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information 
          to enable our Web-based service.] [We use a tracking utility called 
          [XXXX] that uses log files to analyze user movement.][Webtrendslive 
          users may have further obligations of particular language per their 
          license with Webtrendslive. See your license agreement.] [See the Profile 
          section below.] </p>

          <b>Communications from the Site<br>
          ---------------------------------</b></p>
        <p><b>Special Offers and Updates</b><br>
          We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username 
          for the Video Center and Discussion Forums. Established members will 
          occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, 
          and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present 
          the option to not receive these types of communications.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p><b>Newsletter</b><br>
          1-language.com does not currently have a newsletter. If we do have a 
          newsletter our policy is as follows:<br>
          If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact 
          information such as name and email address. Out of respect for our users 
          privacy we provide a way to opt-out of these communications.</p>
        <p> <br>
          <b>Service Announcements</b><br>
          On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related 
          announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended 
          for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not 
          opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. 
          However, these communications are not promotional in nature.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p><b>Customer Service</b><br>
          We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services 
          and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply via email 
          or phone, in accordance with the users wishes.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p><b>Sharing<br>
          --------- </b></p>
        <p><b>Legal Disclaimer</b><br>
          Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to 
          disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a 
          good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current 
          judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web 
          site.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p><b>Aggregate Information</b> (non-personally identifiable)<br>
          We share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. 
          This is not linked to any personally identifiable information.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p><b>Third Party Advertisers</b><br>
          1-language.com does not currently have third-party advertisers.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>These are the instances in which we will share users¡¯ personal 
          information:</p>
        <p>We Share Personal Information in one instance, where users register 
          for the Video Center. We partner with RealEnglish.com to provide the 
          videos and exercises in this section. When the user signs up for these 
          particular services, we share names, or other contact information such 
          as email addresses that is necessary for the third party to provide 
          these services. These third parties are not allowed to use personally 
          identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services, 
          and providing information requested by the user in the registration 
          process.</p>
        <p><b>Links</b><br>
          This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, 
          1-language.com, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such

        <p></p>
        <p> </p>
        <p><b>Chat Rooms, Message Boards, and Public Forums</b><br>
          Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal 
          information online - for example on message boards, through e-mail, 
          or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others.
