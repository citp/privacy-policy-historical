                        <br>
1iota is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent,

                        <strong>Changes of Policy</strong> </u><br>
This policy may be revised over time as new features are added to 1iota or as
we incorporate new suggestions from our members. If we are going to use or disclose
your personally identifiable information in a manner materially different from
that stated at the time we collected the information, you will be notified by
email or by means of a notice on our homepage. 1iota may make improvements and/or
changes in our services or products described in the site, including the terms
and conditions of your use of this site, without liability. 1iota reserves the
right to change these conditions at anytime.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong><u>Required Information</u></strong><br>
When you register for an account with our site you will be asked for your contact
information such as first and last name, typGenre, birthday, city, state and zip
code. In order to become a basic member of 1iota, you must provide this information
to us. A user can access their submitted information and make changes at anytime
on the “my basic account info” section of the site. A user’s
last name cannot be altered on the site due to members’ attempts to transfer
e-tickets as our e-tickets are non-transferable. To alter your last name, please
send an email to <a href="mailto:support@1iota.com?Subject=Account Name Change">support@1iota.com</a>. A user can also cancel their membership at
any time by visiting the “resign your account” section of the site. <br>
                        <strong><br>
                        <u>Optional Information</u></strong><br>
Our site offers users the ability to set up an optional casting profile, under
the “my casting info” section of the site. Information included in
this profile pertains to users' personal attributes, interests, and preferences,
such as, ethnicity, hair color, eye color, height, weight and special skills.
Our site also offers users the ability to submit and store photos of themselves,
under the “my photo” section of the site. Our site offers users the
ability to receive wireless updates by entering your wireless number on the “my
wireless alerts section” of the site and checking the “please send
1iota updates and information box.” Our site offers users the ability to
receive emails from the site regarding upcoming events and event updates. A user
can opt-out of receiving emails by clicking the “please send me 1iota event
updates and info” on the “my email preferences” section of
the site. If you choose to use our referral service to email a friend about an
upcoming event, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.
We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to
visit the site. 1iota does not store this information.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong><u>Customer Feedback</u></strong><br>
We encourage you to share your comments and questions with us. We promise to
read all the mail that is sent to us, but we may not be able to respond to it
all. We will retain such information in the records of your membership. We retain
these records in order to measure and improve our customer service. We may, over
time, delete these records if permitted by law. </font></o:p><br>
</span><span style="color:white"><o:p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
<strong><u>Use and Disclosure</u></strong><br>
We use the information we collect about you in order 1) to provide membership
services, 2) to determine your eligibility to be selected for special events
and shows, and 3) to operate our site efficiently and continue to improve our
membership relations and services.<br>
                                <br>
                                <strong><u>Disclosure to Third Parties</u></strong><br>
1iota will not share any of your personally identifiable information with third
parties except in the limited circumstances described below. <br>
1. If selected for a show, 1iota will be authorized to use the information provided,
to grant you access to the event and take the proper security precautions required
by event staff or security (such as background checks). Background checks will
only be done when attending a national security event, which will be specified
in the event description. A background check will take place upon registering
for that event by the respected government agency.<br> 
<br>
2. We share names with affiliated nightclubs for guest-list options or table
reservations, upon taking advantage of the "1iota nightlife" feature.<br>
<br>
3. We use contact information to send the user information needed to maintain
their account, to contact them when necessary, and to notify them of news about
our company. We also use customer contact information to send the user promotional
material from some of our partners.<br>
<br>
4. <strong>Service Providers:</strong> We use 800-HOSTING to provide website hosting on our site.
When you sign up for a basic membership with 1iota, we will share your “Required
Information” and any “optional Information” as necessary for
800-HOSTING to provide that service. <br>
<br>
5. We share aggregated statistical data with our business partners or for public
relations. We may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic
patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors. However,
these statistics will not include personal identifying information.<br>
<br>
6. Account information may be released when we believe, in good faith, that such
release is reasonably necessary to: (1) comply with applicable law; (2) enforce
or apply the terms of any of our user agreements; or (3) protect the rights,
property or safety of our users and/or any third parties.<br>
<br>
7. As with any other business, it is possible that in the future 1iota could
merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs,
the successor company would have access to the information maintained by 1 iota,
including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this
Privacy Policy unless and until it is amended as described above in the "Changes
of Policy" section. <br>
<br>
8. Bulletin Boards/Chat Rooms: If you use a bulletin board or chat room on this
site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit
there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could
be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally
identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums. We reserve the
right to terminate the accounts of members who use these services in a manner
inconsistent with our Terms &amp; Conditions (link).<br>
<br>
9. These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable
information for any other purpose. <br>
  <br>
  <strong><u>Cookies</u></strong><br>
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping
purposes. We do use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store
in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our
site. We use session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies
for authentication purposes and we use persistent cookies only to remember user
names not passwords. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended
period of time. We set a persistent cookie to store your desScreenName, so you don’t
have to enter it more than once. To remove a persistent cookie, uncheck the “remember
me” box on the log in screen. If you reject cookies, you may still visit
our site, but your ability to login will be limited.<br>
  <br>
  <strong><u>Security</u></strong><br>
1iota is committed to handling your membership information with a high standard
of security. The security of your 1iota membership also relies on your protection
of your 1 iota password/Id number. We strongly urge that you never share your
1iota password/Id number with anyone. You will only be asked for your 1iota password/ID
number if you are logging in as a user. If you believe someone else has obtained
access to your password, please change it immediately or request it to be changed
by <a href="mailto:support@1iota.com?Subject=Password Change">contacting us</a>. These guidelines are the only understanding and agreement we
have regarding your use of the site. The laws of the State of California govern
these guidelines.</font></o:p></span></p>
