When does 1mobile collect personally- identifiable information? 

1mobile will only collect your information if it is already licensed to us, for example, new software release subscriptions for users, software submissions from developers, or orders from customers.

How does 1mobile use the information?

When you authorize us to provide you with new software releases, you��re granting us permission to send information to you via email on a daily, weekly or other time basis. If you would rather not receive this information, you can always easily remove your email address from our mailing list.

When you submit software to our download library, we may offer the product information and other available information to the users. Because of complaints about spamming, your email address is no longer included on our web pages and is not published in the New Upload Digests, etc. However, our hands are tied and we simply MUST request your email address because we will be forwarding messages, complaints, etc. from users and audience to that address.

We may also need to contact you about upload problems, etc. You can always easily remove your software and information from our library via email.
