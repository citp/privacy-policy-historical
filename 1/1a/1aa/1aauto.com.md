# Privacy Statement

Due to various transgressions and violations of unethical businesses, privacy has been a major concern of late. 1A Auto®, Inc. (1A Auto®) is committed to taking the steps necessary for preserving your confidentiality. The statements below outline the policies that 1A Auto® has adopted to protect your information as well as your rights as a consumer. 

**Information Collection and Use**  
1A Auto® is the sole owner of the information collected on our site (http://www.1aauto.com) from our visitors. We will not sell, share or rent this information to others. When visitors or site members send email inquiries to 1A Auto®, the return address is used to answer these emails. In addition, information such as name, address, email and other relevant information is collected upon placing an order with 1A Auto®. The information collected from both of these actions is used strictly by 1A Auto® to provide service and will not be used for any other purpose. 

**Log Files**  
1A Auto® uses IP addresses to analyze trends, track visitor's movement throughout the site as well as gather broad demographic information for statistical use. None of these pieces are linked to personally identifiable information. 

**Security**  
1A Auto® takes every precaution necessary to protect information that you trust us with. When our order form asks visitors to enter senstitive information, such as telephone or credit card numbers, this information is encrypted and is protected with secure socket layers (SSL). While on any of these secure pages, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of your web browser becomes locked, indicating a safe connection, where important information can be transmitted without worry. 

**Notification of Changes**  
If we decide to change our privacy statement, we will post these changes on our web site so that our visitors are always aware of what information we collect and how we use it. If our policy of complete privacy in regards to email address ever changes, visitors will be notified of this change and be given a choice before the policy is implemented.
