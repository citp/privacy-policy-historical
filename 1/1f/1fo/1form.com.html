<h4>The information we collect</h4>
<p>When you sign up as a tenant we collect your name, email address, mailing address and phone number. We also collect sensitive information such as your passport number. We collect demographic information such as date of birth and gender. We collect information from you about joint applicants.  We collect information directly from any joint applicant who signs up with us, and we link that information to your account.</p>
<p>If you provide us with information about another person, we rely on you to inform those individuals that you are providing their personal information to us and to advise them that we can be contacted for further information.</p>
<p>After you have created your profile you may provide us with additional information such as your Driver’s License number, photo (which will appear on your application), previous address of residency, and employment information as well as a personal reference and a business reference.</p>
<p>All the information you provide to us (other than your credit card number) is passed onto the real estate agent, property managers or landlord and forms part of your rental application for the purposes of assessing your application for tenancy to live in the property for which you are applying.</p>
<p>If you are a Property Manager you will need to download the PDF form and fill it out and fax it back to us at the fax number indicated on the form. We use the information to create your account so that you may manage your tenancy applications online.</p>
<p>If you choose not to provide certain personal information (e.g. your date of birth), we may not be able to provide you with the services you require.</p>
<h4>How we use your information</h4>
<p>We collect information from you for the purpose of creating an online account for you so that you may use our platform.</p>
<p>We use and disclose your personal information:</p>
<ul>
	<li>To establish and maintain your relationship as a customer of 1form.com.au.</li>
	<li>To provide the services you have requested from 1form.com.au.</li>
	<li>To administer and manage those services.</li>
	<li>To answer your inquiry.</li>
	<li>Where you have consented to the use or disclosure of your personal information.</li>
	<li>For direct marketing by email, specials on products or services you have shown interest in.</li>
	<li>To provide you with information about offers, promotions, goods or services, which we believe may be of interest to you.</li>
</ul>

<p>We may share your personal information with our service providers and other third parties and their contract partners for the purposes of analytics and reporting, including reporting to agents, lead generation to real estate agents and so that the third parties can contact you directly about their offers, promotions, goods or services.
</p><p>We may share your personal information with third parties who provide products and services regarding property and real estate. In doing so, we ensure that such third parties have a privacy policy that applies to your information. If you would like a list of who we provide your personal information to, please contact our privacy officer. If you do not wish to have your personal information provided to third parties, please contact our privacy officer.</p>
<p>If we contact you for direct marketing without obtaining your prior consent, we will provide you with the opportunity to decline any further marketing communications. If you at any time receive any communication from 1form.com.au which you would not like to receive, please contact us at <a href="mailto:tenantenquiries@1form.com.au">tenantenquiries@1form.com.au</a> and we will remove your name from our mailing list, or you may use the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each email communication.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.</p>
<p>You consent to our use and disclosure as set out above</p>
<h4>Cookies</h4>
<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. Whilst we do use session ID cookies on this site, we do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.</p>
<p>We use these session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time, however we do not use persistent cookies. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file. <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/278835">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/278835</a></p>
<p>If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as editing your details and submitting applications may be limited.</p>
<h4>Third Party Cookies</h4>
<p>The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies. These third parties use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.</p>
<p>Access to your personal information</p>
<p>If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct or update it by making the change on your profile page or by emailing our Customer Support at <a href="mailto:tenantenquiries@1form.com.au">tenantenquiries@1form.com.au</a> or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed above.</p>
<h4>Security</h4>
<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as passport number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>
<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can email us at <a href="mailto:tenantenquiries@1form.com.au">tenantenquiries@1form.com.au</a></p>
<h4>Changes in this Privacy Statement</h4>
<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.</p>  </div>
