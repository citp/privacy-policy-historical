 <p><font face="Arial">We use third-party advertising companies to serve our ads on the Internet. 
 These third-party advertising companies employ cookie and 1x1 pixel .gif 
 technology to measure and improve the effectiveness of ads for their clients. 
 To do so, these companies may use anonymous information about your visits to 
 our Web site and other Web sites. This information can include: date/time of 
 banner ad shown, the banner ad that was shown, their cookie, the IP address. 
 This information can also be used for online preference marketing purposes.
 </font> </p>
 <p><font face="Arial"><b>Consumer Information</b> <br>
 During the process of delivering an ad to you, LoveToKnow does not collect any 
 personally identifiable information about you—such as name, address, phone 
 number, or e-mail address. However, LoveToKnow does obtain some types of 
 nonpersonally identifiable information—such as the Internet Service Provider 
 you use to connect to the Internet, your browser type, or the type of computer 
 operating system you use (Macintosh or Windows, for example). The information 
 collected by LoveToKnow is used for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring 
 ad effectiveness on behalf of our advertisers. In some cases, you may 
 voluntarily provide personal information in response to a specific ad (the 
 advertiser may ask you to fill out a survey or provide your zip code). If this 
 does occur, LoveToKnow may collect this information on behalf of an advertiser. 
 This information is used by an advertiser to respond to your request. In 
 addition, LoveToKnow may combine this information with other users’ information 
 and review it in an aggregate form to understand the type of people who view a 
 specific type of ad or visit a particular kind of website.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial"><b>Data Collection</b> <br>
 LoveToKnow—as well as most sites on the Internet—use “cookies” to enhance your 
 experience on the web. What are cookies and why do we use them? First, 
 LoveToKnow cannot use these cookies to identify you personally in any way. A 
 cookie is a unique number that is provided to you the first time LoveToKnow—or 
 any site that uses cookies—serves an ad to you. This unique number, which is 
 stored in a cookie file on your computer, helps LoveToKnow target ads to you. 
 This cookie can help LoveToKnow ensure that we do not serve you the same ad 
 multiple times and help our advertisers understand what you like and do not 
 like about their offerings so they can cater better to your needs the next time 
 you are interested in their products or services. While we believe cookies 
 enhance your Internet experience by limiting the number of times you see the 
 same ad and delivering more relevant content to you, they are not required for 
 LoveToKnow to deliver you an ad.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial">If you do not want the benefit of cookies, there is a simple procedure to 
 delete your cookies manually. Please consult your web browser’s help 
 documentation for more information.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial">If you have any additional questions about LoveToKnow’s dedication to 
 consumer privacy, please contact us.</font></p>
