<br>

<br>

<br>

3.3	Although we will do our best to protect your Personal Information and keep it secure, unfortunately the transmission of information via the internet is never completely secure and we can therefore not guarantee the security of your Personal Information transmitted to the Website and any transmission is at your own risk.  Nevertheless, once we have received your Personal Information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.<br>
<br>
<span class="strong">4.	Use of your Personal Information</span><br>
<br>
4.1	We confirm that any Personal Information which you provide to us shall be used only for the following purposes and shall not be kept longer than as is necessary to fulfil these purposes:-<br>

Where we use third party companies to process your data on our behalf (for example, to send you emails on our behalf or about our products or process your payments to us), they may also use tracking technology, such as cookies.<br>
<br>

We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your Personal Information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. <br>
<br>
