</p><h3>What information does I-CD Publishing collect from me via its web site 192.com?</h3>
<br>
Anyone may register for searches through  I-CD Publishing's web site, 192.com. 
I-CD Publishing believes that your experience with us will be improved if you 
personalise your service, and you can do this by providing us with your name, 
e-mail address and postcode. 
A good  example of the merits of a personalised service is: 
Should your details be searched by another customer of 192.com, 
I-CD would be  able to supply you with the details and IP address of the person 
making that search, thereby allowing you to "watch the watcher". .  
You are, of course under no obligation  to provide  your personal details to us, 
but please note that under NO CIRCUMSTANCES is this information made available to 
the public through our Directory Enquiry service.
<p>
i-CD may also collect information on the way in which you use the 192.com service  
and  access third party providers that operate through the 192.com web site to help 
ascertain your preferences and usage patterns. This information will be used to 
continue to improve the site.  In addition, 192.com may routinely collect other types 
of information, such as the automatic numbering information provided by your  
telephone network (similar to caller ID-type information), the Internet protocol 
address provided by your web browser, or any other information made available simply 
through your use of 192.com.  We may also record the oral or voice communications 
that you make  when contacting I-CD Publishing (UK) Ltd, for training purposes. 
PLEASE NOTE: We do of course view the content of your phone calls on our Click'n'Call 
service as strictly private and do not record these calls.

</p><p>
</p><h3>How does I-CD Publishing use my information?</h3>
<br>
Most  web sites recall information about visitors by using cookies, which are small 
data structures that identify an individual  and allow password protection. When  
you access 192.com from a computer, I-CD may store cookies on your computer's hard 
drive (NB: Cookies cannot harm or interfere with your machine in ANY way). Cookies 
may also be stored on 192.com's servers when you access the 192.com Service by modem..  
From time to time,  I-CD Publishing may use your email address to share with you  
information about the new and innovative I-CD Publishing products  and services 
to 192.com, which are specially developed or based on information and feedback received 
from our customers.  Your postcode may be used to create an easy to remember personal 
account number to ensure availability in your area. Furthermore, I-CD Publishing may 
supplement the information we collect with information we obtain from third parties. 
<font color="#FF0000">
IMPORTANT: When you perform a search on 192.com, 192.com will store a log that you made that search for security and privacy reasons. This information may be disclosed to others such as the data subject, the police, or other users in line with 192.com's policy of providing transparency, as a part of ICUCme services for example.
</font>
<p>
</p><h3>Will anybody else have access to my information?</h3>
<br>
192.com distinguishes between "personally identifiable information" (which can be used 
to identify you specifically) and "non-personally identifiable information" (which 
cannot be used to identify you specifically). Respecting your privacy is important to 
I-CD Publishing, and so we take particular care in how we use and share your personally 
identifiable information. We may make personally identifiable information available to 
our employees and certain third parties with whom we contract. For example, we may 
provide this information to parties providing technical support services for 
I-CD Publishing (UK) Ltd or to third parties who provide optional services to our users. 
I-CD Publishing may provide unique identifiers, aggregate statistics, demographic, 
and other non-personally identifying information about our users to advertisers, 
Service Providers, and other third parties. Such information can help these parties 
better  their services to you and other consumers.
While I-CD Publishing is committed to protect your privacy, we cannot guarantee that 
your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never 
be disclosed in ways not described in this policy. Third parties may, for instance, 
unlawfully intercept or access transmissions and private communications without our 
consent. In addition, I-CD Publishing may disclose personal information if required 
to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably 
necessary to (i) comply with the legal process, (ii) respond to claims of a violation 
of the rights of third parties, or (iii) protect the rights, property or safety of 
I-CD Publishing, our users of 192.com or the public. 
I-CD Publishing cannot accept any responsibility for accidental or inadvertent disclosure, 
unauthorised access or for other disclosure as required by law or described herein. 

<p>
</p><h3>When I use 192.com, what information might other Service Providers collect from me?</h3>
<br>
It is important to understand that other companies and individuals ("Service Providers") 
may provide content or offer products or services in conjunction with or accessed through 
192.com. It is possible to access these Service Providers while using 192.com's service. 
I-CD Publishing is not responsible for the actions, practices or content of Service 
Providers. We neither guarantee that Service Providers will adhere to suitable privacy 
standards nor accept responsibility for their policies, information practices or other 
actions. You alone are responsible for any information that you provide to third parties 
through the use of 192.com.

<p>
</p><h3>What else can I do to protect my personal information?</h3>
<br>
The best way to protect your privacy is always to be careful when disclosing any personal 
information, both in deciding what you reveal and to whom you reveal it. For instance, 
192.com may offer users the opportunity to access phone calls, conference calls, talk 
lines, chat rooms, forums, message boards, mailing lists, and other communication 
exchanges. Please remember that any information that is disclosed through such means 
may become public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose 
any information under these circumstances, particularly with respect to personal 
information. We also recommend that you do not share your password with anyone. 
You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your password and any account information.

<p>
</p><h3>What safeguards are in place to protect the privacy of children?</h3>
<br>
<b>
I-CD Publishing is of course particularly concerned about the privacy and safety of 
children. I-CD Publishing has no intention of collecting any personally identifiable 
information from anyone under the age of 13. I-CD Publishing does not knowingly invite 
or permit individuals under the age of 13 to use 192.com. It must be noted however, 
that I-CD Publishing has no reasonable method of preventing individuals under the age 
of 13 from accessing 192.com.</b>

<p>
</p><h3>May I review, correct or delete my personal information?</h3>
<br>
I-CD Publishing currently provides users the ability to disable, review or correct 
personal account information maintained by 192.com. To remove information from the 
directory complete a <a href="#" onclick="window.open('http://www.192.com/download/C01.rtf','C01');">C01 form</a>.
<p>
</p><h3>Your Acceptance of these Terms</h3>
<br>
By using 192.com, you signify your acknowledgement of and agreement to the I-CD 
Publishing Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use our 
Service. As we noted above, we may change our Privacy Policy occasionally. If we decide to 
change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you can always 
be aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we 
disclose it. Your continued use of 192.com following the posting of any changes to these 
terms on this web site will mean that you accept those changes.
<p>
</p><h3>Share your views with us.</h3>
<br>
I-CD Publishing is always interested in your views and looks forward to hearing from you 
about privacy, whether you have questions or suggestions. Please send email to 
<a href="mailto:feedback@192.com">feedback@192.com</a>, or write our Privacy Policy Administrator at I-CD Publishing (UK) Ltd
