 		<h2>2. 192.com's  privacy commitment</h2>
 		<p>192.com has been providing an online directory service since 1997. Whilst 192.com endeavours to provide users with the broadest possible set of information , 192.com is also committed to 
 		protecting the privacy of any individual who wishes their Personal Information not to be shown in search results. This Policy sets out the means by which You can have Your Personal Information 
 		removed from the Service.</p>
 		<p>192.com is also committed to keeping Personal Information of users of the Service secure and only to use it for the purposes set out in this Policy and as agreed by You.</p>
 		<p>192.com is committed to complying with the provisions of the Data Protection Act and is registered with the Information Commissioner's Office under number: Z2501438.</p>
 	</div>
<div id="infoPublished" class="ont-about-anchor"></div>
 	<div>
 		<h2>3. Personal Information published on 192.com</h2>
 		<p>192.com publishes Personal Information from the following databases:</p>
 		<ul class="ont-list-disc">
 			<li>Directory Enquiries</li>
 			<li>Electoral Register</li>
 			<li>Company Directors</li>
 		</ul>
 		<h3>The Directory Enquiry Database</h3>
 		<p>This is the national directory enquiry database which is licensed to 192.com by British Telecom. BT collects this information from all the UK's telephone companies and provides the resulting database 
 		of numbers to all of the UK's directory enquiry service providers. If You wish that Your details do not appear in directories such as 192.com or 118 services You need to contact Your telephone service 
 		provider who will set You up with Ex-Directory status. This change will automatically be communicated to all directory enquiry services.</p>
 		<p>If Your concern is merely to avoid annoying tele-marketing calls, You don't need to go Ex-Directory. A more effective action is to register with the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) which maintains 
 		a database of people that do not wish to receive such calls. Tele-marketing companies are legally obliged not to call numbers that have been registered on TPS.</p>
 		<p><a href="http://www.tpsonline.org.uk/" title="Visit Telephone Preference Service website" rel="external">www.tpsonline.org.uk</a></p>
 		
 		<h3>Electoral Register</h3>
 		<p>There are two versions of the Electoral Register. The Full Electoral Register can only be used for electoral and other restricted purposes. The Edited Electoral Register was created in 2002 to provide 
 		a consented national name and address database that can be used for non-electoral purposes. Everyone has the right to opt-out of the Edited Electoral Register. Among the many uses of the Edited Electoral 
 		Register is the use by directories such as 192.com, by companies to prevent fraudulent credit card use, and by many charities such as adoption and fostering agencies and organ donation charities. There are 
 		many advantages to being on the Edited Electoral Register.</p>
 		<p>For convenience, 192.com obtains the Edited Electoral Register from a credit reference agency who in turn obtains the information direct from local authorities. To opt-out of being listed in the Edited 
 		Electoral Register You should contact Your local council or tick the relevant box on the annual voter registration form. 192.com recommends only opting-out of the Edited Electoral Register if You have a 
 		specific need. If Your only concern is to avoid direct marketing, or "junk mail" as it is sometimes called, there is a more effective way than opting-out of the Edited Electoral Register. This is 
 		because the Edited Register is only one source of many of names and addresses for marketing companies. The Mail Preference Service maintains a list of all those people that do not wish to receive direct 
 		marketing and this is used by almost all direct marketing companies to avoid sending such mail:</p>
 		<p><a href="http://www.mpsonline.org.uk/" title="Visit Mail Preference Service website" rel="external">www.mpsonline.org.uk</a></p>
 		<p>In addition to opting-out of the Edited Electoral Register through Your local council, You may also contact 192.com directly to be removed from the Electoral Registers published on the Service. To do 
 		this please <a href="http://statics.192.com/rel-4b1357/downloads/C01.pdf" rel="external" title="Click to download form">download the record removal form</a> and mail it to the address given.</p>
 		
 		<h3>Company Directors Database</h3>
 		<p>The Company Directors Database is a list of all UK company directors which is collated by Companies House. Company director information is in the public domain to encourage transparency regarding the
 		companies that consumers deal with. Only under very unusual circumstances will Companies House allow a director's details to be made anonymous. Should You wish to investigate this possibility please contact 
 		Companies House on: +44 (0) 303 1234 500</p>

 <div id="infoCollected" class="ont-about-anchor"></div>
 	<div>
 		<h2>4. Personal Information collected during registration / payment</h2>
 		<h3>What Personal Information is collected and why?</h3>
 		<p>If You register with 192.com You will be asked to provide Your name and email address and You will be asked to choose a password for Your account. This information helps to ensure that Your account is 
 		protected and allows 192.com to display private information to You about Your account. Your e-mail address is used as Your 192.com user name, but it also provides a means of contacting You about Your account, 
 		about the Service and to promote our products and services to You.</p>
 		<p>If You pay to access premium services on the Service it will be necessary to provide Your address, credit / debit card details and date of birth. This enables the card transaction to be processed including 
 		checks to prevent unauthorized use of Your credit card by fraudsters. In performing these checks Your Personal Information may be disclosed to a registered Credit Reference Agency which may keep a record of 
 		that information. You can rest assured that this is done only to confirm Your identity, that a credit check is not performed and that Your credit rating will be unaffected.</p>
 		<p>Personal Information collected from You during registration / payment will never be published on the Service.</p>
 		<p>During registration, we will seek Your agreement to send You the regular 192.com newsletter informing You about the Service and providing offers and promotions. 192.com will also seek Your agreement to share 
 		Your contact details with carefully selected partners so that they may send You offers and promotions. If You do not wish to receive the 192.com newsletter or offers, You can <a href="https://secure.192.com/account/emailPreferences/" title="Unsubscribe to emails">unsubscribe</a> at any time by going to 
 		"Your Account", and selecting "change e-mail preferences", or You can write to: Customer Service, 192.com Limited, Units 8-10 Quayside Lodge, William Morris Way, London, SW6 2UZ.</p>
 		<h3>Will 192.com share Personal Information collected during registration / payment with third parties?</h3>
 		<p>Except as specifically set out in this policy, 192.com does not disclose Your Personal Information to any other person or organization except that it may disclose Personal Information to 192.com employees 
 		and companies acting as data processors on 192.com's behalf. Data processors acting on 192.com's behalf may only use the information in line with 192.com's instructions. In addition 192.com may disclose 
 		Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good faith that such disclosure is necessary to: (i) comply with legal process or assist law enforcement agencies including the Police and the 
 		Information Commissioner's Office; (ii) respond to claims of a violation of the rights of third parties; or (iii) protect the rights, property or safety of 192.com, its users, or the public.</p>
 	</div>
 <div id="searchLogs" class="ont-about-anchor"></div>
 	<div>
 		<h2>5. Search Logs</h2>
 		<h3>What search logs are collected and why?</h3>
 		<p>192.com keeps logs of all searches conducted by users of the Service (whether registered or not) including the IP (Internet Protocol) address from which a user session was conducted, the identity of the 
 		searcher (where we have it), the date and time of each search made and the results provided in response to a search. This information may be used: i) to assist in improving the nature and quality of the Service; ii) 
 		to advise individuals whose Personal Information appears in search results that their Personal Information has been displayed to a user of the Service and, if the searching user's identity is known, this information 
 		may be passed to the individual whose Personal Information has been displayed; and iii) 192.com also reserves the right to pass on such logs to the Police in the event that it might assist with an investigation.</p>
