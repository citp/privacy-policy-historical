	      <h3> Last Updated: 15th July 2005 </h3>
	      <h2> About www.192.com</h2>
	      <p> 192.com has been providing online directory enquiries since 1997. We are committed to protecting the privacy of our users by keeping all personal information that we collect secure and by only using such data for the purpose(s) for which it was collected and for which we have our users’ consent. While our objective is to provide the most comprehensive UK directory of people and businesses we also respect the choice of people to be removed from particular published databases. We are registered with the Office of the Information Commissioner under the Data Protection Act 1998. </p>
	      <h2>Information that we collect during the registration process </h2>
	      <p> If you register with 192.com we will ask you to provide a small amount of personal information including, but not limited to, your name, address and email address. This information helps us to ensure that your account is protected and allows us to display private information to you about your account. Your e-mail address is used as your 192.com username, but it also provides us with a means of contacting you about your account, about the service we offer and to promote our products and services to you. Subject to having gained your consent to do so during the registration process we may send you offers and promotions from carefully selected third parties. You may <a href="http://www.192.com/account/changeemailprefs.cfm">unsubscribe</a> from receiving such promotions at any time.</p>
	      <h2> Personally Identifiable Information </h2>
	      <p> We do not share Personally identifiable Information with Third Parties. </p>
	      <p><strong>Choice/Opt-out </strong> We provide you with the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, if you purchase a product/ser vice but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference on our order form.</p>
	      <h2> The 192.com Newsletter </h2>
	      <p> When you register with 192.com we will seek your consent to send you our monthly newsletter by email through which we will keep you informed about our service and provide offers and promotions. Users who do not wish to receive our newsletter can <a href="http://www.192.com/account/changeemailprefs.cfm">unsubscribe</a> at any time. If a user no longer wishes to receive newsletters or promotional communications they may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions in each newsletter or communication or by e-mailing us at: <a href="mailto:feedback@192.com">feedback@192.com</a> or a user can unsubscribe by going to <strong>Your Account</strong>, and selecting: <strong>change e-mail preferences. </strong>In addition a user can write to: Customer Service, i-CD Publishing (UK) Ltd. Units 8-10 Quayside Lodge, William Morris Way, London, SW6 2UZ to opt-out. </p>
	      <h2> Access to Personally identifiable Information </h2>
	      <p> If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update or delete it by making the change on our member information page, <strong>Your Account</strong>, or by emailing Customer Support at: <a href="mailto:feedback@192.com">feedback@192.com</a>. Alternatively you can contact us by writing to us at: </p>
	      <p><strong> Units 8-10 Quayside Lodge, William Morris Way, London, SW6 2UZ. </strong></p>
	      <p> You will be notified when your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that third party. </p>
	      <h2>Supplementary Information </h2>
	      <p> We may also collect supplementary information about you from other sources such as public records or information obtained by other companies and legitimately supplied to 192.com.</p>
	      <h2> Does anyone else have access to my information? </h2>
	      <p> Except where detailed elsewhere in this policy 192.com does not disclose your personal information to any other person or organisation except when we may disclose personal information to our employees and companies acting as data processors on our behalf. In addition we may disclose information if required to do so by law or in the good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (i) comply with the legal process, (ii) respond to claims of a violation of the rights of third parties or (iii) protect the rights, property or safety of 192.com, our users or the public.</p>
	      <h2> Information that we collect about your usage of the service </h2>
	      <p> We keep automatic logs of usage by all users (whether registered or not) including the IP (Internet Protocol) address from which a user session was conducted, the date and time of each search made and the results provided in response to a search. We may use this information to assist in improving the nature and quality of the service we offer; we may, if requested by data subjects, provide them with details of searches conducted on them; and we also reserve the right to pass on such logs to the police in the event that it might assist with an investigation. We do link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
	      <h2> Survey Data </h2>
	      <p> Some of our users earn free credits on 192.com by participating in contests or surveys on our site; either our own, or third party surveys and contests. Users who choose to do so are clearly informed about the kind of personal information they are required to disclose and how it will be used.<strong></strong></p>
	      <p> In addition we offer other survey or contest opportunities that are not directly related to earning free credits. If a user participates in any of our surveys or contests, we will request personally identifiable information from them. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and they therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address) and demographic information (such as postcode). </p>
	      <p> We use this information to<strong></strong> help us improve our products and services and gain valuable statistics on customer activity on our site. Survey information collected by 192.com is not sold to third parties.<strong></strong></p>
	      <p> We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.</p>
