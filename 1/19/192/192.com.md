## About 192.com

[ ](http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.192.com&sealid=101)

192.com has been providing online directory services since 1997. We are committed to protecting the privacy of our users by keeping all personal information that we collect secure and by only using such data for the purpose(s) for which it was collected and for which we have your consent. While our objective is to provide the most comprehensive UK directory of people and businesses we also respect the choice of people to be removed from particular published databases. We are registered with the Office of the Information Commissioner under the Data Protection Act 1998. 

## About the data we hold on you 

192.com publishes personal data taken from various public and private data sets:

Free Directory Enquires   
Electoral Roll   
Directors Database

### The Free Directory Enquiry Database

This is the national directory enquiry database maintained by BT. Your telephone provider licenses your data to BT who then sublicense it to all directory enquiry providers. If you wish to amend or remove your data from this database you need to contact your Telecom Provider who can then update your information with BT, and BT will then distribute the corrected information to all Directory Enquiry providers. If you are concerned to prevent marketing calls the best way to do this is to sign up to the Telephone Preference Service rather than going x-directory.

### Electoral Roll

There are two versions of the Electoral Roll. The Full Electoral Roll can only be used for electoral and certain other restricted purposes. The Edited Electoral Roll can be used for a variety of other purposes including directories such as 192.com. Everyone has the right to opt-out of the Edited Electoral Register. 192.com publishes Electoral Roll data from 2002 through to the current Edited Electoral Roll. We obtain this data from a credit reference agency. If you wish to opt-out of the Edited Electoral Roll you can contact your local council who will advise how to do it. The Electoral Roll is used by companies for a variety of different purposes from identity checking to direct marketing. We would recommend only coming off the Electoral Roll if you have a specific need to. If you are concerned about preventing junk mail the best way to do this is to sign up to the Mail Preference Service rather than opting-out of the Edited Electoral Roll.
