### COLLECTION & USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

We collect personal information from you when you register to become a member of the website.

In addition, we may ask you for health information, such as height, weight, age, fitness and nutrition details, some of which may be classified as sensitive personal information. This may also include photographic images of you. You do not have to provide us with your health information, however this means that you may not be eligible to enter some competitions, nor able to receive tailored information specific to your needs.

Contact information will not be disclosed publicly by us unless authorised by law. Your health information, however, may be disclosed publicly on the website, along with your image. This is for the purposes of publicly profiling your fitness, displaying the results of competitions, promoting the service and encouraging other members.

It is your responsibility to advise us of any changes to your personal details to ensure we can keep our records accurate and up to date. We will only collect information directly from you.

We will not track your internet activity when you visit our website. Your contact information may be used, in addition to the primary purposes outlined above, for account and billing purposes, marketing purposes (see below), by third party service providers (to the extent required for the limited purpose of providing services contracted to us so that we may service you) or to respond to an enquiry if you choose to contact us. In certain circumstances, such as in response to a claim of copyright infringement, we will use your email address to action a request for a Take Down Notice, or to otherwise administer our terms of registration (for example, notifying you of breach).

We will preserve the content of any email or information you submit if we believe we have a legal requirement to do so, or if any form of email abuse is suspected.

### MARKETING MATERIAL

If you consent to us doing so, we may provide you with material from time to time about new services and products available to you from us, or other service providers in partnership with us. This information will only come from us. We will not pass on or on-sell your personal information to other providers without your consent. When we collect your contact information we will ask you if you consent to receiving marketing material. If at any time you no longer consent then you must click the ‘unsubscribe’ link on the mail-out.
