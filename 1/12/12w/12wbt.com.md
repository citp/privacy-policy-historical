You do not have to provide us with your health information. However, your failure to provide us with such information means that you may not be eligible to enter some competitions or will not be able to receive tailored information specific to your needs.

#### Public Areas of the Website

We may provide areas on the website where you can publicly post information about yourself and can communicate with others such as the community forum or blog and submit information and content. By engaging in such conduct, you acknowledge your understanding that any such information or content you supply may be accessible by other users and may appear on other websites or web searches, and therefore this information could be read, collected, and used by others throughout the world. For example, if you post your email address on the community forum, you may receive unsolicited messages from other users. We have no control over who reads your postings or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so please use caution when posting any personal information. 

#### Children

### 2.3 To whom will 12WBT disclose my personal information?

We generally do not disclose contact information about you publicly or to other third parties by us unless it is authorized or required by law (or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us in relation to the Website) or as otherwise outlined in this policy. 

We may display personal information about you (including your health information and your profile photograph) on the Website where you have authorized us to do so (either through your public posting or other consent or agreement with us). This is for the purposes of publicly profiling your fitness, displaying the results of competitions, promoting our services and Website and encouraging other members. If you do not wish to have such information removed, then you must contact us at [support.usa@12wbtsupport.com](mailto:support.usa@12wbtsupport.com). 

When you publicly post information or content through the Website, we will display your user submitted content as part of the Website. The Website may include functionalities that allow you to control whether or not the public or other users of the Website are able to view your user submitted content. We will use reasonable efforts to implement your selection. 

From time to time, we will also disclose your personal information (on a confidential basis) to agents and others that we use in the ordinary operation of our business, such as account and billing, shipping and fulfillment, marketing and promotion, user experience research and surveys, website hosting and support and maintenance. We will only disclose your information to the extent required for the limited purpose of the third party providing services contracted to us so that we may service you. 

We may also disclose aggregated data (in a form that does not identify you individually) to our advisors for the purposes of conducting market and user experience analysis. 

We may share your information in a business transfer. As with any other business, we could merge with, or be acquired by, another company, or we may file for protection under applicable bankruptcy laws in the future. In such event, user information obtained and maintained by the Website, including personal information, will transfer to a successor entity in connection with the corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change. User information submitted prior to any such transfer would remain subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy (as it existed on the date of the submission). However, user information submitted after a transfer to a successor entity may be subject to a new privacy policy adopted by the successor entity. 

We may share your information for our protection and the protection of others. We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by applicable law or when we reasonably believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us; enforce or apply this Privacy Policy, the terms and conditions of use of the Website, or other agreements or investigate, prevent, or take action suspected or actual prohibited activities, including but not limited to, fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person or to prevent financial loss to any person or entity; or otherwise protect the rights, property, safety or integrity of the Website, its users or others. 

While we store the majority of the personal information that we collect from your in Australia, we may from time to time store some of the information in a computer server located in the United States. We will take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to ensure that the overseas recipient does not breach the Australian Privacy Principles.

### 2.5 Manner of collection

If you are disclosing details of another person (for example, a minor on whose behalf you are registering), it is your sole responsibility to ensure that that person understands and consents to the collection, use and disclosure of their personal information in the manner set out in this policy. 

## 3\. INFORMATION COLLECTED BY OUR WEBSITE

### 3.1 Tracking of user experience

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on the Website. We link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our Website. 

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Website. A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s "help" file. If you reject cookies, you may still use our Website, but your ability to use some areas of our Website may be limited. 

We, and our third party tracking utilities-partners, employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our Website by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of users on our Website. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on webpages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information. 

We also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. 

As is true of most web sites and mobile applications, we and, in some instances, our third party tracking-utility partners gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. These third party tracking-utility partners may collect information about your activity on our site and your interaction with our advertising and other communications and use this information to determine which ads you see on third-party websites and applications. The Website is not presently configured to respond to DNT or "do not track" signals from web browsers. 

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the Website, to track users’ movements around the Website and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. 

### 3.2 Advertisements

We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Website or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner may use cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on the Website and other websites that you may visit to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted advertisements, you may opt-out by [clicking here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/). Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads. 

### 3.3 Social Media Features

The Website includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Website, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Website. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them. 

### 3.4 Forums

Our Website offers blogs or community forums that may be publicly accessible (or accessible by other users of the Website). You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at [support.usa@12wbtsupport.com](mailto:support.usa@12wbtsupport.com). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. 

## 4\. MARKETING MATERIAL

We may use your personal information to provide you with material, promotions and communications from time to time about services and products available to you from us, or from other service providers in partnership with us, or to invite you to continue to use our services. This information will only come from us. We will not on-sell your personal information to other providers without your consent. 

You may opt out of receiving promotional materials from us at any time by contacting us at [support.usa@12wbtsupport.com](mailto:support.usa@12wbtsupport.com), or by following the 'unsubscribe' link on the relevant promotional emails.

Certain parts of the Website (such as those parts that require you to provide us with your credit card number) provides the ability for you to transmit information to our Website in an encrypted form by using secure socket layer technology (SSL). However, other parts of the Website are not protected by any form of encryption to protect information you send from your computer to us over the Internet. Further, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.

We will destroy or de-identify your personal information when it is no longer needed or required to be kept by law or to provide services to you.

You can manually delete your personal information on the Website by accessing your account. We will also preserve the content of any email or information you submit if we believe we have a legal requirement to do so, or if any form of email abuse is suspected.
