“12FLY” provides this Privacy Policy to inform users of this mobile application (the “App”, and collectively with the Site, the "Services") about our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information.

**Changes**

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason; each version will apply to information collected while it was in place. We will notify you of any material changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy on our Site, and by email if you have provided us with your email address. The changes shall take effect after we post or otherwise notify you about the changes. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.

**Your Consent**

By using the Services, you are consenting to our processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us. "Processing" means using cookies on a computer or using or touching information in any way, including, but not limited to, collecting, storing, deleting, using, combining and disclosing information, all of which activities will take place in Malaysia. If you reside outside the Malaysia, your personally identifiable information will be transferred to Malaysia, and processed and stored there under Malaysia privacy standards. By visiting our Site and providing information to us, you consent to such transfer to, and processing in Malaysia.

**Information Collection**

Registration with us is optional. However, please keep in mind that you may not be able to use some of the features offered by the Services unless you register with us. When you register with us and use the Services, you provide information about yourself. Depending on how you use the Services, such information that you provide to us may include: (a) your name, email address, age (to comply with legal requirements), user name, password and other registration information; (b) your interaction with the Services and advertisements; (c) transaction-related information, such as when you make purchases, respond to any offers, or download or use applications from us; (d) information you provide us when you contact us for help; (e) credit card information and (f) information you enter into our system when using the Services, such as contact information and project management information.

In addition, we may collect certain information that cannot be used to personally identify any user, and may be provided to third parties.

We also collect non-personal data about each users IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Services.

We do not access or store information that you have saved on your mobile device such as contacts and appointments. Although in order to provide the Services, our Applications may interact with some features on your mobile device, such as your calendar and e-mail applications, all processing occurs on the mobile device itself, and no information is transferred to 12FLY.

**Links; Third-Party Applications**

The Services may include links or otherwise allow you to access and submit information to third-party applications or sites. This Privacy Policy applies to the Services only. Any information you submit to linked sites or other applications will be subject to the privacy policies of those sites or applications, if any.

We do not share personal identifying information collected on the Services, including email addresses, with third parties for their direct marketing or solicitation. We will use your contact information to contact your from time to time to provide you with important information or required notices. We will disclose your personally identifiable information if we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law, regulation or other government authority or to protect our rights and property or the rights and property of the public. We may also cooperate with law enforcement agencies in any official investigation and we may disclose your personally identifiable information to the relevant agency in doing so.

In the event we use such advertising networks on the Services, we will list such network here. Since our use of advertising networks may change form time-to-time, we encourage you to review this privacy policy periodically for changes. Advertisers and ad networks use cookies, web beacons or similar technologies on your browser to help present offers, better target and measure the effectiveness of their advertisements by using data gathered on an anonymous basis over time and across their network of Web pages to determine the preference of their audiences.
