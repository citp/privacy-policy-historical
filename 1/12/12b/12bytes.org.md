# Privacy Policy – 12Bytes.org

**General**

We are committed to protecting your personal informa…

You know when a “privacy” policy starts out with something like that, it’s probably utter bull s**t, right? Well this one is simple, short and clear. The tl;dr (too long; didn’t read) version: I’m a privacy advocate myself, so you’re in good hands.

 **Cookies**

12bytes.org typically does not use cookies, however cookies may be used in certain circumstances where they may be required in order to provide necessary functionality. If you decide to block cookies and/or other web technologies such as JavaScript, the majority of this website will continue to function normally.

 **Personal Information**

12bytes.org does not collect any personal information other than that which you willingly disclose through the various contact forms and subscription options. Providing accurate information such as your real name and email address is never required, however if you choose to provide a fake email address, understand that it will not be possible to reply to your inquiry.

Any personal information which you choose to disclose will remain confidential and will likely be deleted shortly after it is received unless there is a justified reason for retaining it, which is unlikely.

If you choose to submit a comment on an article or blog post, understand that the information you submit will be viewable by the public with the exception of your email address. It is therefore suggested that you avoid disclosing your real name if you wish to remain anonymous.

 **Web Server Logging**

Similar to almost every website, 12bytes.org is powered by a fairly typical software stack which records various information about your web browser, as well as your IP address. This information may be used for troubleshooting purposes or to provide statistics about visitors. This data is never shared with anyone.
