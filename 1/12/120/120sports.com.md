Certain information, including cookie based information, is automatically collected via our Services. If you do not wish to provide certain information necessary for enhanced functionality or content on our Services, please do not use such functionality or content. In addition, if you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows a user to accept or reject most cookies. Certain cookies that are set when some video products are accessed on our Website, called local shared objects or Flash cookies, may not be managed using the settings in your web browser. Information on managing, accepting and rejecting these cookies is available from Adobe on the [Adobe website](http://www.adobe.com/). If you set your browser or Adobe Flash options not to accept cookies or local shared objects, you may not be able to take advantage of certain Services.

If you do business with us, you may not opt out of notifications related to those business transactions (e.g., e-commerce). 

  6. Other Information



_No Spyware or Adware_

We do not install any spyware or adware in connection with our Services, or distribute any commercial message, or authorize any third party to distribute any commercial message, by means of spyware or adware. “Spyware” or “adware” is any software which has been downloaded to or installed on an Internet user’s computer or device, without the user’s actual consent, and facilitates the distribution of any commercial message to the user. If you feel you may have spyware from another company installed on your machine, there are various anti-spyware/adware software applications available on the Internet to identify if this has occurred.

_Do Not Track_

We do not engage in the collection of personal information about your online activities over time and across third party websites or online services. Accordingly, we do not currently process or comply with any web browser’s “do not track” (DNT) signal or other mechanisms that provide consumers with the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personal information about your online activities over time and across third party websites. However, as noted in the section captioned “Third Party Cookies and Web Beacons; Network Advertisers,” we allow some advertisers and other third party companies to collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit our Website or use the Mobile App which, through “tracking technologies,” can be combined with non-personally identifiable information during your visits to other websites or when you use other mobile applications in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or a third party web beacon to collect this information.

_Our Security Practices_

Because security is important to both Stadium and you, we maintain physical, electronic and administrative safeguards designed to ensure the security of our systems and protect your personal information from unauthorized or inappropriate access. In this regard, we use industry-standard SSL encryption to protect data transmissions and store personal information in secure datacenters. It is important to note that no method of safeguarding information is 100% secure. While we try to ensure the protection of your personal information, we cannot guarantee that our safeguards will be effective or sufficient. In addition, you should be aware that Internet data transmission is not always secure and we cannot warrant that information you transmit utilizing the Services is secure. 

_Links and Third Party Sweepstakes or Contests_

Our Services contain links to other websites and products produced by Stadium and to websites and products operated by unrelated third parties. In addition, if you click on an advertisement within our Services, you may be directed to a web page within our Services or to a third-party website or product. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third party websites or products, and we encourage you to read the privacy policies of every website and product that collects personally identifiable information from you. This Privacy Policy applies only to our Services, unless you are notified otherwise upon accessing any third party website or product, in which case the terms and conditions set forth in such notification will apply.

Sometimes sweepstakes or contests found through the Services are hosted or operated by a third-party advertiser or sponsor. In those cases where we are not the sponsor, operator or host of a sweepstakes or contest, we may have no control over the information collected and, accordingly, we encourage you to review the official rules of the sweepstakes or contest as well as the advertiser’s or sponsor’s privacy policy applicable to the sweepstakes or contest before participating.

_Your California Privacy Rights_

If you are a resident of California, pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, you may request information regarding our disclosure of your personal information to a third party for that party’s direct marketing purposes. Any such disclosure made to a third party by us would be otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. To make such a request please send an email to legal@watchstadium.com or write to us at: 122 North Aberdeen, Chicago, IL 60607.

_Special Rules For Children_

Because of federal law, we are not permitted to knowingly collect any personal information from a child under the age of thirteen without the consent of that child’s parent or guardian. To the extent that any personal information from children under the age of thirteen is inadvertently collected, the statements in this Privacy Policy about our collection and use of personal information also apply to our treatment of that personal information.  If a child who we know to be under the age of thirteen and for whom we have not received parental consent attempts to utilize a service on our Services which is not available to children, he/she will not be able to access it and may receive a message which relays that he/she is not eligible for such feature.

_International Use_

Your personal information may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or where we have engaged a service provider, and by your use of the Services you acknowledge that we may transfer information to countries outside of your country of residence, which may have different data protection rules than in your country.
