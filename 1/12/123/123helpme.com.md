You always remain in control of the information you provide to 123HelpMe. We collect two types of information about visitors. If you place an order with us, we collect personal information, such as name, and e-mail address - which you have voluntarily submitted to us.  We also collect aggregate information, such as information about how many visitors log on to our sites, the pages they access, etc. We never, under any circumstances, receive credit card information or telephone numbers.
