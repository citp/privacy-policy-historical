# 123Signup - Policy

123Signup is committed to protecting your privacy. 123Signup does not collect any personal information from you for its own use, but rather passes the information you provide during the registration process to the sponsoring organization and any other necessary third party. 123Signup may act as a custodian of your information by storing your information on behalf of the sponsoring organization. We maintain the privacy of your information using security technologies and adhere to policies that prevent unauthorized use of your personal information.

**What information does 123Signup collect and how is it used?**

To process and fulfill your request, we need to know your name, email address, mailing address, credit card number, expiration date, and other information that the sponsoring organization may request of you. We might request additional information from you in the future on an opt-in basis. You may choose not to provide this information; although, some products and services might not be available to you unless you provide the additional information. We might also ask for information about your interests or for feedback about our site so that we can tailor your experience to improve our site and service. Providing us with this information is always optional.

When you register through 123Signup, we provide the necessary information about you to the sponsoring organization and/or other necessary third parties (such a credit card company for billing) to ensure the successful fulfillment of your request. In addition to the information we collect directly from you, we also monitor and track usage of our Web site, viewing and traffic patterns, customer behavior, and other similar information. We compile this information into a statistical aggregate. We use this aggregate information as well as all of your personal information for internal business and administrative purposes including to improve our Web site, our product and service offerings, our operations, and our customer service. We may disclose this aggregate information, and any individual information provided by you on an opt-in basis, to third parties. We also might use your personal information from time to time to send you notices about special offers, new products, services, promotions, and other similar information.

**How does 123Signup protect customer information?**

When you request to communicate with a vendor or access your account information, we offer the use of a secure server that encrypts all your personal information before it is sent to us to help prevent unauthorized access to your information.

**123Signup Privacy Policy Changes**

If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post these changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone.
