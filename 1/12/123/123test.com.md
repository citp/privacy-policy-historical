# About 123test

Our tests are designed to help you find serious answers to your questions about IQ, personality, or career assessment. Tests published on 123test.com are not "marketing tools" used to sell you various products and services, or to obtain personal information, email addresses or résumés from you.

123test is a Netherlands-based company with an organizational structure just like the internet. That means that although our headquarters are located at the [Radboud University Nijmegen](https://www.ru.nl/) in the Netherlands, people from all over the world contribute to our network of websites.

## Tests are based on cognitive science

Our research staff is headed by Edwin van Thiel, PhD in Artificial Intelligence and Psychometrics, who is the co-founder and co-owner of the 123test Company. We aim to be the best in IQ and personality testing and career assessment. Our tests are free and fast, but they also have to be scientifically valid and reliable. To achieve all of these goals, for the last ten years we have been using a special test development scheme that has been highly successful. It includes:

  * Using scientific literature as a theoretical basis for tests
  * Collecting massive amounts of empirical data to ensure representative sampling
  * Drawing upon the skills and experience of PhD level test developers
  * Generating valid reports through 'expert systems' based on empirical findings
  * And some other stuff we prefer not to say
