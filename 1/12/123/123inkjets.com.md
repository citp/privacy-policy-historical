**STATEMENT OF RESPONSIBLE ONLINE MARKETING**

The ValueClick Network's information usage practices are based on two beliefs: first, that protecting user privacy is essential to the growth and prosperity of the Internet; second, that a personalized web experience can provide significant benefits to Internet end users if done properly. In accordance with these beliefs, the ValueClick Network creates opportunities for advertisers and consumers in revolutionary ways without compromising individual privacy. 

**I. INFORMATION WE COLLECT: INDIVIDUAL INTERNET CONSUMERS**

**A. Personally Identifiable Information (PII).** _  
_ The ValueClick Network sites are designed to offer Internet consumers with a variety of valuable products. When you place an order with a ValueClick Network site, you will be asked to provide your name, address, zip code, email address and billing information. This information is used to process your order and we cannot do so without it. The ValueClick Network will never request or collect data regarding medical/health conditions; racial or ethnic origin; political, religious or philosophical beliefs or affiliations; trade union membership or sex life. 

The ValueClick Network may use your PII for customer service, to provide you with information that you may request, to customize your experience on the Site, and to contact you when necessary in connection with transactions entered into by you on the Site. We also may use your personal information for internal business purposes, such as analyzing and managing our business or combine the information we have gathered about you with information from other sources. 

Unless you tell us not to, we may use your personal information to contact you about offers or promotions from the ValueClick Network and selected third parties we think you would be interested in. 

**B. Non-Personally Identifiable Information (PII).** _  
_ When you visit a ValueClick Network site, we send a cookie and/or gif file ("Cookies") to assign an anonymous, unique identifier to the end user's Internet browser. Cookies are small data files commonly used on the Internet to help optimize and personalize the Internet end user experience and identify repeat visitors to websites. For example, Cookies enable ValueClick to track your shopping cart and retrieve your information and preferences when you return to our site. 

For each visitor to our website, our Web server automatically recognizes only the visitor's IP address. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. Upon visiting our website, we assign each visitor a unique ID that is used to track visitor traffic patterns within our website. We also collect aggregate and user-specific information on what pages visitors access or visit. We reserve the right to retain all website traffic reporting data as long as may be reasonably necessary for accounting and auditing purposes. 

**II. INFORMATION SHARING**

The ValueClick Network may use third party vendors (e.g., credit card processors) to help us operate our business and ValueClick Network sites or administer activities on our behalf. We may share your information with these third parties for those limited purposes. Any third-party vendor so used has agreed to protect the confidentiality of information provided by ValueClick. 

The ValueClick Network and/or our marketing partners may enhance and/or merge PII about consumers who have opted-in to receive marketing communications with commercially-available third party data collected from other sources in an effort to ensure that the messages being sent to the consumer in online and/or offline marketing programs are relevant to their interests. In the event we enhance and/or merge such personally identifiable information with data collected from other sources, we will take reasonable steps to maintain the integrity and quality of that information. 

The ValueClick Network may share PII (including information that has been enhanced with information from other sources) with advertisers, third party marketers, our affiliated entities for their online and/or offline marketing programs or in connection with the sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial asset, reorganization or liquidation of any of the ValueClick Network companies. While ValueClick strongly encourages clients and partners to adopt responsible approaches to online marketing, ValueClick is not responsible for the information practices of clients or their partners. The collection, use, and disclosure of information by clients and partners are subject to their respective privacy policies, which may differ from ValueClick's policy. 

The ValueClick Network may release account and any other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to respond to a subpoena or otherwise comply with the law; enforce or apply our [Terms and Conditions ](https://web.archive.org/cs/policies_termsandconditions.html) and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of ValueClick or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection. 

**III. CONSUMER CHOICE AND ACCESS**

If at anytime you no longer wish to receive offers from a 123inkjets.com, you may "unsubscribe" through this website or by using the unsubscribe option within any promotional offer. In compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act, you will be removed entirely from our email list and will no longer receive offers from us. If you have registered or submitted PII under more than one email account, you must submit separate unsubscribe requests from each account. 

The Cookies we use do not have an "opt-out" option, yet you still have the option of blocking the use of cookies by changing a setting in your Internet browser. Please see your browser supplier's website for details on how to do this. 

The ValueClick Network uses software and third-party sources to validate the accuracy of PII provided and/or filter suspicious data. You may change, correct or update your information by email by contacting CustomerSupport@InkBlvd.com. Changing or deleting your information or otherwise opting-out of receipt of communications from the ValueClick Network will change or delete the data only in our database for purposes of transacting future business on our sites and for managing future communications from 123inkjets.com. These changes and deletions will not change or delete information already collected as part of a particular transaction. ****

**IV. SECURITY**

The ValueClick Network employs industry standard security measures to ensure the security of all data. Any data that is stored on ValueClick's servers is treated as proprietary and confidential and is not available to the public. ValueClick also encrypts sensitive information such as passwords and financial data. ValueClick has an internal security policy with respect to the confidentiality of customer and other data, allowing access only to those employees or third parties who have a need to know such information for the purpose of effectively delivering ValueClick products and services by means of user login and password requirements. The ValueClick Network routinely evaluates its data security practices to identify security threats or opportunities for improvement. 

No transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of ValueClick to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect your PII, ValueClick cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. You acknowledge and assume this risk when communicating with a ValueClick Network company. 

**V. CONSENT AND CHANGES**

The ValueClick Network may find it necessary or be legally obligated to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will post those changes on this page and update the effective date so that you are always aware of the information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. Except as otherwise required by law, modifications to this Privacy Policy will not affect the privacy of data collected by ValueClick prior to the effective date of the policy change unless we provide you direct notice and the opportunity to opt-out of such proposed change. 

**VI. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY AND SPAM**

The ValueClick Network is very sensitive to the issue of children's privacy and makes every effort to protect the privacy of children using the Internet. ValueClick's web site, products, and services are not developed for or directed at children. Our policy is not to permit anyone under the age of 13 to do business with us. If you believe your child has provided the ValueClick Network with any personally identifiable data by registering at a ValueClick web site, please contact privacy@”.$site_name.”.com to have them removed. 

The ValueClick Network is committed to proper Internet practices and full compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 (15 U.S.C. § 7701). It is our policy to prohibit the sending of unsolicited or "Spam" email by ValueClick or any of its marketing partners. 

Please note that under the CAN-SPAM Act, an advertiser is required to provide an opt-out mechanism for consumers to unsubscribe from future emails about the advertiser. Although not required to by law, many email marketers also include an opt-out mechanism to enable consumers to be removed from their mailing list. This has caused some confusion for consumers in opting out. The table below clarifies which opt-out mechanism you should use.
