  * Saving your name & e-mail address so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our website.
  * Display the most appropriate advertising based on your interests.

We allow other companies that are presenting advertisements on our websites and, sometimes, in our newsletters to use tracking technology on your computer. We do not give any personally identifiable information to them as part of this relationship. Unless you visit the website of these companies and provide them with personally identifiable information about yourself, these tracking technologies tell those advertisers nothing about who you are. Our advertisers' use of tracking technology is subject to their own privacy policies.

**What is 123Greetings.com's practice regarding IP addresses ?**  
We collect and analyze traffic on our website by keeping track of the IP addresses of our visitors. IP addresses are unique numeric identifiers that are assigned to each computer browser accessing the Internet. An IP address, by itself, cannot identify you personally. However, when combined with other information provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), your IP address can be used to identify the computer originating a message.

123Greetings.com includes the sender's IP Address in the source of each ecard HTML that is created at the website. This is available to the ecard recipient and anyone else who has access to the recipient's ecard. This limits your ability to communicate anonymously using ecards. ecards are not intended for anonymous communications, and such activity is expressly prohibited by our Terms of Use. What does 123Greetings.com do with the ecard messages & information ?

When you send one of our ecards, the information you provide to us is used to customize your greeting with the recipient's name and with your message, and to deliver an e-mail to the recipient. We treat our ecards as private correspondence between the sender and the recipient and the contents will not be disclosed to anyone other than the intended recipient.

Under normal circumstances, we will not monitor or edit the contents of the online ecards you send. Occasion, however, we may need to view your message in connection with the technical processing of your ecard or the maintenance of our network. Also, if you ask one of our customer service representatives to help you send an ecard or to verify that an ecard was sent, that representative will be able to access all information about the ecard, including the recipient's e-mail address and the message.

If we have reason to believe, that an ecard has been sent using a false e-mail address or attempt to pose as someone else sending an ecard, information about you - including your computer's IP address - may be disclosed as part of any investigation into your actions.

123Greetings.com uses reasonable precautions to keep the personal information disclosed to us secure and to disclose such information only to third parties we believe to be responsible. However, we are not responsible for any breach of security or for any actions of any third parties which receive the information. 123Greetings.com also links to a wide variety of other websites.
