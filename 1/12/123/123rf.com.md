 **Withdrawing consent or otherwise objecting to direct marketing**

Wherever we rely on your consent, you will always be able to withdraw that consent, although we may have other legal grounds for processing your data for other purposes, such as those set out above. In some cases, we are able to send you direct marketing without your consent, where we rely on our legitimate interests.  You have an absolute right to opt-out of direct marketing, or profiling we carry out for direct marketing, at any time. You can do this by following the instructions in the communication where this is an electronic message, or by contacting us using the details set out below.

 **What rights do I have?**

You have the right to **ask us for a copy** of your personal data; to **correct, delete** or **restrict** (stop any active) processing of your personal data; and to **obtain the personal data you provide to us for a contract or with your consent in a structured, machine readable format** , and to ask us to **share (port) this data to another controller.**

In addition, you can **object to the processing** of your personal data in some circumstances (in particular, where we don't have to process the data to meet a contractual or other legal requirement, or where we are using the data for direct marketing). 

These **rights may be limited** , for example if fulfilling your request would reveal personal data about another person, or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate interests in keeping. 

To exercise any of these rights, you can get in touch with us - or our data protection officer - using the details set out below. If you have unresolved concerns, you have the **right to complain** to an EU  data protection authority where you live, work or where you believe a breach may have occurred. 

**How do I get in touch with you?**

We hope that we can satisfy queries you may have about the way we process your data. If you have any concerns about how we process your data, or would like to opt out of direct marketing, you can get in touch at [info@123rf.com. ](mailto:info@123rf.com)

**Which 123RF entity is my data controller, and which affiliates might my data be shared with?**

The data controller for your information is 123RF Limited.  Your personal data may be shared with other members of our group and certain third party agents.  

 **How long will you retain my data?**

Where we process registration data, we do this for as long as you are an active user of our sites and for 12 months after this.

Where we process personal data for marketing purposes or with your consent, we process the data until you ask us to stop and for a short period after this (to allow us to implement your requests). We also keep a record of the fact that you have asked us not to send you direct marketing or to process your data so that we can respect your request in future.

Where we process personal data in connection with performing a contract, we keep the transactional data for six years from your last interaction with us (or such longer period as may be required by law).
