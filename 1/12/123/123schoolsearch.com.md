# Welcome 123Schoolsearch.com

  
123SchoolSearch is committed to protecting your privacy. We will only release the information you provide here to the specific colleges you request information from, the agency that handles their information requests, or as required to do so by law. Education Value will not use the information we collect to contact you directly. When you request information from a specific school, members of that school may contact you to provide you with additional information about the school you expressed interest in. At Education Value, we may use the information we collect to understand trends and usage patterns to improve the quality and browsing experience of our site. 

When you submit information to a particular school, that information is also governed by the privacy policy of that particular school. 

**Information We Collect**   
When you visit our site, we collect your IP address and information you submit to us via the forms on our site. This may include your zip code, email address, first name, last name, address, phone numbers, program and campus preferences and a few additional pieces of information requested by each of schools in our database. 

**Cookies**  
Our site will try to place one or more small pieces of information in your browser (called "cookies"). If your browser is configured to accept these cookies, they are resubmitted to our site on each subsequent page view. We use these cookies to recognize that your second and subsequent requests originate from the same person. This allows us to provide a better browsing experience, but our site will still function if your browser blocks our cookies. 

**Security**  
123SchoolSearch has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of information within our immediate control. We cannot, however, guarantee the performance or adequacy of such security measures.
