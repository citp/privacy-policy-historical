**Privacy Statement** (modified 01-30-2012)

We are strongly committed to your privacy, and offer this full disclosure of our policy in order that you fully understand the data collection and dissemination policy of eProfitsdirect.com.

The policy here applies to general usage of eProfitsdirect.com as intended, and can be superseded by court order or to follow any law enforcement, legal process or civil proceedings as required.

 **User-supplied Data**

We may ask detailed personal data during the process of signing up for an account with eProfitsdirect.com, or as part of usage of the services available or to process support requests. This data may include, but is not limited to, full name, mailing address, telephone number, email address, financial status, credit card data.

With the exception of credit card and billing data, all explicitly requested or voluntarily supplied information is considered non-confidential, and by contacting or supplying such data you agree to provide an unrestricted license to display, use, disseminate, reproduce and transfer any information supplied, for both commercial and non-commercial purposes.

While we strive to maintain privacy of certain aspects of this data, in provision of our services at times higher than normal levels of personal data dissemination may occur, through errors, omissions, or malicious targeting of our servers. By submitting your information to eProfitsdirect.com you accept that this is a potential consequence, and waive any rights to lay claim against eProfitsdirect.com or its officers, through legal or civil channels.

**User-supplied Billing Data**

All transactions related to payment and credit cards are conducted through secure 128-bit SSL connections to ensure the privacy and security of your personal financial data.

Application Data

Upon installation of software applications provided by eProfitsdirect.com you may be requested to submit voluntary data such as username or profile information. This data will not be a requirement for operation of the software, and is submitted only by your consent. This data may be subsequently used to log into distributed servers outside of our control, and as such is beyond the remit of our privacy policy. Furthermore, in connecting to third-party server or distributed clients the software may facilitate the passing of data that is not in itself personally identifying, but could be used for tracking or triangulation purposes, including but not limited to IP Address.  
Third Party Websites

We may provide links to third party sites from this website, or include third-party advertisement or statistical controls. These sites will not have access to any User-supplied Data offered by you within the context of our website, but may themselves request and/or gather information which is subject to their own privacy and data policy and cannot be considered under the remit of this company or website.

 **Email Policy**

We maintain lists of email addresses gathered via user-supplied data. The primary use of this address is to contact you with information relating to your account, activity updates, information requested via a support request, or to handle account-related issues.

Email addresses may be stored locally or on third-party mailing solutions. Where third party mailing providers are used, the email sent will be under the sole control of this company, but we may from time to time send information related to third-party offers or information which me believe will be relevant and of interest to you.

These third-party mailings will always contain full data of the mailing party, along with a clear and functioning unsubscribe mechanism should you no longer wish to receive such mailings.  
Updates to Policy

This privacy policy is subject to change, either when material change is requested, or conditional to a substantive change in our internal data policy. It is your responsibility to check this page periodically in order to maintain up-to-date with our policies related to data collection and usage.
