**How do we protect your information?**  
We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order or access your information. 

All the transaction and payment operations on our website are done through third parties that offer the use of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and are then encrypted into our Payment gateway providers' database to be accessible only to those who are authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential.

After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) will not be stored on our servers.

**Do we use cookies?  **  
Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow them) that enable the sites or service providers' systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information to make your browsing easier. 

We use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart and understand and save your preferences for future visits, such as your preferred language.

If you prefer, you can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies via your browser settings. Like most websites, if you turn your cookies off, some of our services may not function properly. Generally, however, you can still benefit from our services.

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others’ rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.

**Third party links  **  
Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our website. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies.
