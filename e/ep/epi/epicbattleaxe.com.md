**The short version**

Here at the Axe, the only personal info we collect is your email address and that’s only if you choose to register as a member on our site. Our server automatically logs your IP address for statistical purposes and our site may automatically attempt to place a cookie on your system, again for stat tracking or to recognize you as a returning member. Additionally, our ad server may place cookies on your system in order to display ads for products and services you may be interested in. We also make sure we’re doing our best to keep any and all data you _do_ share with us secure.

That’s it. We don’t sell your email to anyone, we don’t share our member list with anyone; period. We _do_ adhere to the guidelines of the [Online Privacy Alliance](http://www.privacyalliance.org/resources/ppguidelines.shtml).
