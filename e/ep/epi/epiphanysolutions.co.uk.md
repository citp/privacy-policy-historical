### Advertising and Modern Marketing Tools

We use several modern marketing tools in support of our advertising efforts.

Jaywing may work with third party advertisers that use cookies and similar technologies to provide more relevant advertising about our Products and Services on our website and across the internet. To provide this 'interest-based advertising', the parties combine non-personal data about your online activities acquired over time, which helps cater advertising that is delivered to you. Examples of this may include an advertisement on a Facebook page, or a Google owned page such as a search results page or YouTube, or on a site within Google’s advertising network. We do not share your personal information as part of this process. You can opt-out of these personalised ads from third party advertisers and ad networks who are members of the [Network Advertising Initiative (NAI)](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp&sa=D&ust=1527090525971000) or who follow the [Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.aboutads.info/choices/&sa=D&ust=1527090525971000) by visiting the [opt-out pages on the NAI website](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://optout.networkadvertising.org/%23!/&sa=D&ust=1527090525971000) and [DAA website](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://optout.aboutads.info/%23!/&sa=D&ust=1527090525972000). Opting out may make the ads you see across the internet less relevant to you.

If you have opted out of receiving communications from us, we will not use your email for interest-based advertising, although you may still be subject to certain interest-based advertising depending upon your browser and device settings.

### Recruitment

You may wish to share personal information with Jaywing regarding employment opportunities. As part of the recruitment process, we may ask for your permission to hold your personal information. We will retain the information for two years, or for the duration of your application. If after this period, we have found no suitable vacancies, we will delete your information.

By submitting your details, you give permission for us to circulate your details for recruitment purposes across Jaywing plc as necessary.

We will not send marketing communications to you following a job application with Jaywing plc.

### Security

Jaywing is committed to protecting the security of your personal data. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal data from unauthorised access, use or disclosure. For example, we store the personal data you provide on computer systems that have limited access and are in controlled facilities. When we transmit data over the Internet, we protect it using encryption.

Jaywing takes suitable precautionary measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Your personal information is stored on servers that are kept in a controlled environment with suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure its access. While we take reasonable precautions to guard personal information we collect from you, no security system is impenetrable.

### Business Operations

We use data to develop business intelligence that enables us to operate, protect, make informed decisions, and report on the performance of our business.

## Other Important Privacy Information

### Where We Store and Process Personal Data

Personal data collected by us may be stored and processed in the UK or in any other country where Jaywing or its affiliates, subsidiaries or service providers maintain facilities.

### Our Retention of Personal Data

Jaywing retains personal data for as long as necessary to provide our Services, or for other essential purposes such as for recruitment, complying with our legal obligations, and resolving disputes and enforcing our agreements. Because these needs can vary for different data types in the context of different Products or Services, actual retention periods can vary.
