      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font size="3">EpicSki 
        Privacy Statement</font></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EpicSki has created 
        this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to 
        privacy. We'll cut to the chase: EpicSki does not share personal e-mail 
        addresses or IP numbers with third parties at all (barring legal action) 
        - period! For more details, read on…</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Information Automatically 
        Logged </b><br>
        Like all websites, your IP number (internet connection id) is automatically 
        logged when you visit EpicSki. We use your IP address to help diagnose 
        problems with our servers, and to evaluate site traffic levels (this evaluation 
        does not identify you personally, just the aggregate number of unique 
        users). IP address logging also enables the banning of individual users 
        from the website when a member consistently and severely violate the terms 
        and conditions to which each member agreed when he/she registered. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Cookies </b><br>
        The EpicSki forums uses cookies to save your password so you don't have 
        to re-enter it each time you visit the site and to "remember" 
        which posts are new since your last visit (these are identified by yellow 
        light bulbs and yellow folders), in order to enhance your experience at 
        EpicSki.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>E-Mail Address 
        Collection &amp; Use</b><br>
        The EpicSki forum's registration form requires members to provide their 
        e-mail address. This e-maill address is used for administrative communication 
        exclusively between EpicSki and and that member -- many of these correspondences 
        are automated features (notification of a reply to your post or notification 
        of a new private message) that you may disable in the "My Profile" 
        control panel. E-mail address collection also enables the banning of individual 
        users from the website when a member consistently and severely violate 
        the terms and conditions to which each member agreed when he/she registered.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Other Info Collection 
        &amp; Use</b><br>
        Other requiredinformation (e.g., username), and additional optional information 
        (e.g., location, etc...), is collected in the registration form and is 
        available for all users to access from a link above each post you make. 
        The purpose of this information is so that readers of the forum will get 
        a better understanding of the people with whom they are communicating 
        in the forum. This does not apply to personal contact information or any 
        information that you do not voluntarily provide yourself.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>External Links 
        </b><br>
        This website contains links to other websites, many of which posted by 
        members and not by the EpicSKi administrators. EpicSki is not responsible 
        for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. None of the 
        information you provide on the registration form is transferred to them.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EpicSki does not participate 
        AT ALL with any of the marketing networks (such as DoubleClick) that pool, 
        share and monitor activity across multiple sites. EpicSki's information 
        is collected and used solely for user experience enhancing features and 
        admin within the EpicSki site boundaries.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Special Relationships</b> 
        <br>
        EpicSki is not affiliated with any ski manufacturers, ski resorts, professional 
        associations, or other organizations. EpicSki is an independent operation.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Public Forums </b><br>
        EpicSki makes forums/message-boards/news-groups available to a large community 
        of independent users. Please remember that any information you disclose 
        in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution 
        when deciding to share any of your personal information. We suggest using 
        our private messaging feature should you desire to contact others (this 
        allows contact without disclosing personal information). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When you post personal 
        contact or identification material in one of EpicSki's public arenas (and 
        ALL of EpicSki's forums are public), you are choosing to make that information 
        public and EpicSki bears no responsibility for any undesired outcomes 
        or uses of that information by others, including other registered members 
        of EpicSki. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EpicSki has no control 
        over the behavior of registered members of its forums, other than banning 
        them from further posting if they prove to be destructive to the community. 
        None of the members of this community are employees or in any way associated 
        with EpicSki; everyone in these forums found the website on their own 
        in and registered on their own in order to interact with other unaffiliated 
        (unaffiliated with EpicSki) individuals. Hence the term "public" 
        forum.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Free E-Mail Service 
        (Completely Separate from the Forums)</b><br>
        A completely separate function from the forum is the <a href="eMailSignUp.htm" target="_blank">free 
        e-mail service</a> where you get your own "you@EpicSki.com" 
        e-mail address. This service requires separate registration from the forum 
        and is independent from the rest of the EpicSki website. This service 
        and all activity pertaining to those e-mail addesses is controlled and 
        administered by Everyone.net -- a third party to whom EpicSki refers users 
        who desire this feature. Everyone.net and that entire free e-mail (you@epicski.com) 
        feature has its own privacy policy which can be found here: <a href="http://www.everyone.net/main/html/p_policy.html" target="_blank">Private 
        E-Mail Service Privacy Policy</a>. Other than lending its "@epicski.com" 
        name and linking to Everyone.net's website (where the service is administered), 
        EpicSki has no role and no control over what is done there. EpicSki has, 
        however, found them to be reliable and responsible in the past.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Feel free to send 
        questions or inquire about any additional issues of concern not addressed 
        in this policy statement: <a href="mailto:info@EpicSki.com">info@EpicSki.com</a></font></p>
