## Collected Information and Usage

By using the Site, you consent to the collection and use of your Personal Information by Epicor consistent with applicable data protection law and this Privacy Policy which is expressly incorporated into the Terms. Epicor collects and uses the information you provide to us, including information obtained from your use of this Site. We may use or share Personal Information (e.g., name, address, telephone number, email address, and location) where it is necessary for us to complete a transaction or do something that you have asked us to do. Also, we may use the information that we collect for our business purposes to develop, enhance, and improve our products and services, and for advertising and marketing consistent with this Privacy Policy. By using the Site, you acknowledge, consent and agree that Epicor may collect, process, and use the information that you provide to us and that such information shall only be used by Epicor or third parties acting under Epicor’s direction in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Epicor collects and uses information from you in several ways:  


 **The Epicor Site.** Epicor (or Epicor vendors and suppliers) may observe your activities, preferences, and transactional data (such as your IP address and browser type) as well as related usage behavior depending on whether you are using our Site or a particular Epicor Product. We may use this data for any purpose unless we tell you otherwise in connection with a particular Site or product. While we may collect or log this information, we do not identify you or match this non-Personal Information with your other Personal Information unless or except if we believe doing so will help us better respond to a request you have made or otherwise personalize your experience in using the Site. Where such non-Personal Information is linked to your Personal Information we will treat such information as Personal Information.

>  **Use of Cookies.   **The Epicor Site uses "cookies" and related technologies to help you personalize your online experience and in our electronic communications with you. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.  
> One of the primary purposes of cookies and related technologies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Epicor pages, or register with Epicor sites or services, a cookie helps Epicor to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information and return user log in. When you return to the Site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved.  
> You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Site you visit. 

**E-Commerce.** You may be asked to share Personal Information such as your name, address, telephone number, and email address when you make purchases, seek customer or technical support or otherwise interact with Epicor, including on-line. When you buy direct from Epicor, these purchase transactions may be conducted through Epicor vendors and suppliers. Vendors and suppliers engaged by Epicor on behalf of Epicor may have their use of your Personal Information limited by this Privacy Policy, contractual restrictions, and applicable law. Epicor (through its vendors or suppliers) may limit the acceptance of orders to particular jurisdictions and as permitted by applicable law. You may also make purchases of Epicor Products; seek customer or technical support through Epicor's distributors or service providers. In these circumstances, the collection of your Personal Information may occur directly by the distributor or service provider or a third-party partner on their web site, which will state the privacy policy or policies governing the collection of such information.

 **Product Registration & Technical Support. **Epicor may allow its customers to register products online or through similar ways. Personal Information or data provided for such purposes may be used to carry out the request, service, or agreement for which the information is submitted. With your consent and as otherwise permitted by law, we may also use the information you provide in online registration forms to notify you periodically about important changes to the Site or Application (such as a change to this Privacy Policy or notice of a security breach), new Epicor products and services, and special offers and promotions that may be of interest to you. If you register, we may ask for, among other things, your name, address, email, telephone number, type of product purchased, or other product-identifying information.

 **Online Promotions, Contests and Sweepstakes.** You may be asked to provide an email address or screen name, or other Personal Information, for entry into a particular promotion, including sweepstakes and contests, so that we can let you know if you won a prize. The specific rules and regulations governing the particular promotion, contest or sweepstakes will vary and your participation constitutes your agreement to abide by those rules and regulations. Certain promotions, contests or sweepstakes may be run by a Epicor service provider or vendor or co-branded with one of our partners. In these instances the collection of your Personal Information may occur directly by the service provider or vendor or a third-party partner on their Site. The promotion will state the privacy policy or policies governing the collection of such information if they should differ from this Privacy Policy.

 **As Required by Law and Other Extraordinary Disclosures.** Epicor may be required to disclose your Personal Information if it: (i) believes in its sole judgment that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process (such as a court order, subpoena, search warrant, etc.) or other legal requirements of any governmental authority, (ii) would potentially mitigate our liability in an actual or potential lawsuit, (iii) is otherwise necessary to protect our rights or property, or (iv) is necessary to protect the legal rights or property of others. 

## Security

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be secure, therefore, we cannot ensure the security of any information you send to us and you do so at your own risk.  If Epicor learns of a security system's breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using this Site or providing Personal Information to us, you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues.  Epicor may post a notice on this Site if a security breach occurs. If this happens, you will need a web browser or mobile device enabling you to view the Epicor Site or Application. Epicor may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances or communicate with you by other means if we can. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.
