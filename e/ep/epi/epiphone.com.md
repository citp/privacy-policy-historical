# Epiphone Privacy Policy

####  Effective Date: June 13, 2018

Gibson Brands, Inc. takes your privacy very seriously. For that reason, we have developed this policy to let you know about our collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Data and the choices you have associated with that data. This Privacy Policy applies to all of the Gibson Brands, Inc. divisions and subsidiaries and related websites. Personal Data may be shared without further notice between all Gibson Brands, Inc. divisions and subsidiaries.

It’s important to know that this privacy policy does not apply to your activities on the websites of social networks or other providers that you can reach via links on our websites. Don’t forget to check the websites of these providers for their data protection regulations.

We use your data to provide and improve our services. But we also use your data to market directly to you. We collect several different types of data.

###  Types of Collected Data

Personal Data can be processed only for the purpose that was defined before the data was collected.

The type of data we may collect includes:

  * Address/Phone
  * Gender
  * Age
  * Purchase Information
  * Hobbies
  * Cookies and Usage Data



You are generally not legally or contractually obliged to make available your Personal Data. However, it is possible that certain functions of our websites depend on the availability of Personal Data. If you do not make available Personal Data in these cases, this may result in functions not being available or only being available to a limited extent. For example, if you’d like to allow us to contact you with newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you, you will need to provide your Personal Data and provide us with your consent to process it.

**Usage Data** , which is data that tells us how our websites are accessed and used. Usage Data may include your:

  * Other diagnostic data



Sometimes Usage Data is also personal data because it may let us know who you are.

**Location Data** , which is data about where you are located. Like the other types of data, we will only use and store this information if we have your permission.

**Tracking & Cookies Data**, which is data that allows us to operate our websites (session cookies), store your preferences and settings (preference cookies), and perform security (security cookies). Cookies are files with small amount of data which sometimes include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to your browser from a website and stored on your device. Tracking technologies include things such as beacons, tags, and scripts that collect and track information. Sometimes cookies and tracking data is also Personal Data. Because we need to use different types of cookies with our websites, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some areas of our websites that rely on them. We use cookies and similar software tools such as HTML5 Storage or Local Shared Objects to identify your interests and particularly popular areas of our websites and use this information to improve the design of our websites and make them even more user-friendly. For the same purposes we use the analysis tools Adobe Analytics and Google Analytics; cookies may also be used here.

###  Processing of Data

Personal Data that is no longer needed after the expiration of legal or business process-related periods will be deleted. There may be an indication of interests that merit protection or historical significance of this data in individual cases. If so, the data must remain on file until the interests that merit protection have been clarified legally, or the corporate archive has evaluated the data to determine whether it must be retained for historical purposes.

###  Transfer of Data

We may transfer your information, including Personal Data, outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction. In some of these areas, the data protection laws may differ than those from your jurisdiction and you may not have the same protections. Your data may be maintained in these jurisdictions.

If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer the data, including Personal Data, to the United States and process it there. Your consent under this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of Personal Data represents your agreement to that transfer.

Gibson Brands, Inc. will take steps to ensure that transferred Personal Data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. No transfer of your Personal Data will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place including the security of your data and other personal information.

If Gibson Brands, Inc. is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, your Personal Data may be transferred if you give your continuing consent or another lawful basis exists. We will provide notice before your Personal Data is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.

###  Security of Data

Remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we continue to strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, no one can guarantee its absolute security. However, we are constantly improving our security measures in line with technological developments.

Some browsers have a “do not track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. At this time, we do not respond to browser “do not track” signals, but we do provide you the option to opt out of interest-based advertising.
