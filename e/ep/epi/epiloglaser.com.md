## Privacy Policy

**Introduction**

This privacy policy (“Policy”) is intended to inform users of the websites and products (collectively, the “Services”) provided by Epilog Corporation (“Epilog Laser”, “we”, or “us”) about how we gather and use personal information collected by us in connection with the Services. We will take reasonable steps to protect user privacy consistent with the guidelines set forth in this policy and with applicable U.S. laws. In this policy, “user” or “you” means any person using or otherwise benefitting from the Service or otherwise submitting personal information to Epilog Laser via the Services. BY SUBMITTING INFORMATION TO EPILOG LASER, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS PRIVAY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE THE SERVICES.

**What Information Do We Collect?**

_Personal Information:_

We collect the personal information you submit to us, including your name, email address, street address, city, state/province, zip or postal code, country, company name, phone number, and the serial number of your product in order to communicate with you, send you the physical or digital items you requested, and possibly send you limited physical or digital informational communications.

_Other Personal Identifiers:_

Apart from the personal information described above, Epilog Laser does not collect and does not wish to receive any personally identifying information. Without limitation, you shall not submit to Epilog Laser any social security number, financial account number, credit or debit card number (other than the number of the card paying for the Services), driver’s license number or government ID number. Children under 13 years of age that use the Services are not permitted to provide or upload any personal information.

_Web Tracking Information:_

We, and our third party service providers, may use web tracking technologies such as cookies, pixel tags, and clear GIFs in order to operate the Services efficiently and to collect data related to usage of the Services. Such collected data (“Web Tracking Information”) may include the address of the websites you visited before and after you visited the Services, the type of browser you are using, your Internet Protocol (IP) address, what pages in the Services you visit, how long you visited pages, and what links you clicked on. In order to collect Web Tracking Information and to make your use of the Services more efficient, we may store cookies on your computer. We may also use web tracking technologies that are placed in web pages within the Services to collect information about actions that users take when they interact with the Services and Epilog Laser’s Contractors (as defined herein) may also do so. We do not correlate Web Tracking Information to individual user Personal Information, except for internal operational, product development, and administrative purposes of the Services. Some Web Tracking Information may include data, such as IP address data, that is unique to you. You may be able to modify your browser settings to alter which web tracking technologies are permitted when you use the Services, but this may affect the performance of the Services.

**What are the Legal Bases for Our Collection and Use of Personal Information?**

We rely on the following legal grounds to process your Personal Information:

  * Performance of a contract – we need to collect and use your Personal Information to perform our agreement with you to deliver the Services as described in this Privacy Policy
  * Consent – We may use or disclose some of your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy subject to your consent.
  * Legitimate interests – We may use your Personal Information for our legitimate interests to improve our products and services and the Services. Consistent with our legitimate interests and any choices that we offer or consents that may be required under applicable laws, we may use technical information as described in this Privacy Policy



**Who Collects Your Personal Information?**

In some cases, Epilog Laser collects your Personal Information directly. In other cases, we rely on a third party service to handle the collection and temporary processing and storage of your Personal Information. The third party service we use for this purpose is Logiforms Software Inc., located in Vancouver, British Colombia, Canada.

**How Do We Use the Information We Collect?**

_Personal Information:_

Your Personal Information may be supplemented with additional information regarding your activities on the Service; to the extent that such information is linked specifically to you, we will treat that additional information as your Personal Information. We may use your email address to send you marketing materials about Epilog Laser and its products and services. We may also use Personal Information for the internal operation, product development, and administrative purposes of the Services.

_Web Tracking Information:_

We use Web Tracking Information to administer the Services and to understand how well our Services are working, to store your user preferences, and to develop statistical information on usage of the Services. This allows us to determine which features and content users like best to help us improve our Services, to personalize your user experience, and to measure overall effectiveness.

_Aggregate Information:_

We will also create statistical, aggregated data relating to our users and the Services for analytical purposes. Aggregated data is derived from Personal Information and Web Tracking Information, but its aggregated form it does not duplicate or reveal any Personal Information or relate to or identify any individual. This data is used to understand our customer base and to develop, improve, and market our services.

**What Information Do We Disclose to Third Parties?**

_Personal Information:_

We will not disclose your Personal Information to any third parties except as follows:

  * (i) to third party contractors engaged to provide services on our behalf (“Contractors”), such as performing marketing, analyzing data and usage of the Services, hosting and operating the Services or providing support and maintenance services for the Services, or providing customer service.

Such carriers are not our contractors, and any information that a carrier collects in connection with your use of the Services is not “Personal Information” and is not subject to this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the acts or omissions of telecommunications carriers.

_Legal Exception:_

Notwithstanding the above, we may in any event use Personal Information and other information collected through the Services to the extent required by lay or legal process, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements (including this Privacy Policy) with you, or if in our reasonable discretion use is necessary to protect our legal rights or to protect third parties.
