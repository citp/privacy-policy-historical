Users who have provided us contact information will be informed upon changes to our privacy policy.

**What personally identifiable information does the Foundation collect from me?**

The Epilepsy Foundation respects the personal privacy of the visitors to our website. We believe keeping your information private and in a secure environment is very important. When you browse the informational portion of our website, you do so anonymously. Personal information is not collected, unless you voluntarily provide us with that information as described below. To participate in our Community, you must provide an e-mail address/user name and password. (Please note that it is not a closed community and posts can be found via search engine outside of the website.) We will not share with third parties your name, street address, telephone number or e-mail address without your consent. We do not sell or rent your personal information. We provide no mechanism for an advertiser to reach you, unless you sign up directly with an advertiser or outside vendor.

In order for the epilepsy.com website to improve its performance and design and to provide you with better services, we track anonymous aggregate usage information through analysis of log files. The type of information collected is basic statistical data, such as channels and sections viewed, time of access and amount of time, search phrases used to reach the Foundation's website, and browser type. This information is not personally identifying you in any way, and we cannot get back to you, the user, through this data. We use this aggregated information in order to learn what are the most popular sections of our website, for general promotional purposes and for making decisions about the future strategy and direction of the website. The aggregated information may also be shared with third parties to promote Epilepsy Foundation services and the website or to add to general knowledge concerning the public's need for epilepsy education and treatment services.

You voluntarily provide us with personal information when you choose to become a website member, make a donation, join our Speak Up Speak Out grassroots network or Newsroom, join our Community, subscribe to one of our e-newsletters, participate in a research campaign and when you purchase a product from our catalog or online store. The information we collect through these transactions includes such things as your name, address, phone number, email address and, when you make a financial transaction, your credit card number. This allows the Foundation to send you messages and to share information with you that we think you may find useful. We study our users' demographics, interests and behavior based on this information voluntarily provided for a variety of reasons, including to have better information on the needs of people with epilepsy and how to improve our services.

Donor records are kept in the strictest of confidence. At times, we select and offer portions of our mailing list to carefully screened organizations that we believe may interest you.

The Foundation will not knowingly request personal identifying information from children under the age of 18 without parental consent. If we learn that we have personal information from a child under 18, we will delete that information from our database as soon as possible. The Community Forums and Chat Rooms are intended for use by people age 13 or older.

**Linked Internet Websites**

The Foundation hyperlinks to numerous websites that we believe are of interest to people with epilepsy. We do not control the privacy policies of business partners, advertisers, sponsors or other websites to which we may provide hyperlinks, and the privacy policies of any of these third parties may differ from ours. When you hyperlink to the website of one of our business partners, advertisers, sponsors, or other websites, you are subject to their privacy policies and not those of the Foundation. The Epilepsy Foundation is not responsible for such provisions and expressly disclaims any and all liability related to the privacy policy or practices of such other websites.

**Where should I go if I have a question or a complaint about the Foundation's privacy policy and practices?**

The Epilepsy Foundation is committed to efficiency and transparency. We communicate with our supporters, donors, and prospective donors by email, postal mail, phone, and other means, both to request contributions to our cause and to educate the public about epilepsy and seizures, volunteer opportunities, and events in local communities and around the world. These efforts help advance our mission to lead the fight to overcome the challenges of living with epilepsy and to accelerate therapies to stop seizures, find cures, and save lives. As a result, in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) guidelines and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) guidance, the Epilepsy Foundation allocates a portion of our fundraising costs to program services. As a nonprofit organization that is exempt from federal taxation, we ensure our donors’ money is spent as efficiently and effectively as possible.
