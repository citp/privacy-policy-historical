# epilepsy.com: Your source of in-depth information

**Epilepsy.com Privacy Policy**

The Internet contains a wealth of information, unfortunately, it may also contain personal details about you that you don't want everyone to know like your real name (lots of people on the Internet use aliases, alter egos or nicknames), street address, phone number, or e-mail address. When you go online, sites you visit may be gathering information about you without your knowledge. At epilepsy.com, we strive to help our users protect their privacy while using our services. 

Our policy is to respect and protect the privacy of our users. This policy statement tells you how we collect information from you and how we use it. Using the Internet should be a fun experience and we want to help you make it so.

The information you provide for your personal epilepsy.com account is shared among the epilepsy.com site management, be assured that epilepsy.com will not disclose your personal information to third parties without your consent. epilepsy.com may disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) epilepsy.com rights or property, other epilepsy.com users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. Epilepsy.com may disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.

Epilepsy.com shares aggregate information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties. For example, we will say epilepsy.com's audience is x percent females and y percent males. This data is used to customize epilepsy.com content and advertising to deliver a better experience for our users.

There are cases where epilepsy.com may ask you for personal information such as your name, email address, and birth date. For example, we request personal information when you register for an epilepsy.com account, for online shopping or transactions, or for services that require registration or subscription (for example: newsletter). Epilepsy.com needs to collect this information for fulfilling tracking/verifying compliance with Epilepsy.com policies as well as federal, state and local laws and/or for editorial and feedback solicitation purposes.

In case you change your mind or some personal information may change (such as your zip code), we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove the personal data you give us. You can do this at the member information page or by contacting our Customer Support organization at -------------

OPTING-OUT

Information provided at the time of registration or submission from a guest who is 13 years of age or over may be used for marketing and promotional purposes by epilepsy.com and our affiliates or companies that have been prescreened by epilepsy.com . To keep you in control of your personal information and the communications directed to you, we allow you to opt-out of the following services: sharing your information in our member directory, receiving communications from epilepsy.com about new features or services, and receiving communications about offers from third-party companies that offer a product or service that we think would be of value to you. If a guest objects to such use for any reason, he/she may stop that use -- either by e-mail request to -------------- or by modifying his/her member information online.

Information provided when purchasing products from any of our online stores may be used for marketing and promotional purposes and is subject to the opt-out processes described on, or linked to, each order form.

POLICIES FOR KIDS (INDIVIDUALS UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE)

Epilepsy.com encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in the activities offered on the site. No information should be submitted to or posted at epilepsy.com by guests under 13 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian.

Unless otherwise disclosed during collection, epilepsy.com does not provide any personally identifying information, regardless of its source, to any third party for any purpose whatsoever from our guests under 13 years of age. All registrants receive an e-mail confirming their registration. In addition, when a guest under 13 registers, he/she is required to provide the e-mail address of his/her parent or guardian and that parent or guardian receives an e-mail alerting them to that Registration. The parent or guardian must validate the account, as described in the e-mail, in order for the potential member to use most epilepsy.com interactive services. No information collected from guests under 13 years of age is used for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever, either inside or outside epilepsy.com except as explicitly stated during registration for contests or promotions (and in that case, the information collected is used only for the specific contest or promotion).

Although users under 13 years of age may be allowed to participate in some contests and promotions, if such a guest wins, notification and prizes are sent to the parents or guardians identified in the initial registration process. Publication of contest winners names, ages, or images for individuals under 13 require parental or guardian consent.

We do not allow users under 13 years of age to be listed in our member directory or to receive direct marketing communications from epilepsy.com or to be sent our third-party offers.

POLICIES FOR TEENS (INDIVIDUALS 13 TO 17 YEARS OF AGE)

Teens are required to provide the e-mail address of a parent or guardian and a notification message is sent to the parent or guardian of all users who are 13 to 17 years of age which identifies the information supplied at registration and allows the parent or guardian to be aware of and participate in the user's online experience.

USE OF IP ADDRESSES

An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers -- the big computers that "serve up" Web pages -- automatically identify your computer by its IP address.

Epilepsy.com collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to audit the use of our site. When users request pages from Epilepsy.com sites, our servers log the guests' IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our house rules or terms of service or to protect our service, site, customers or others.

Some services within epilepsy.com , such as certain message boards, may display IP addresses along with the message poster's name and message. Please review each service prior to use and only use those that disclose information you are comfortable with sharing.

USE OF COOKIES

What are cookies? Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make Web-surfing easier for you by saving your preferences while you're at our site. We never save passwords or credit card information in cookies. The use of cookies is an industry standard and can be found at most major Web sites.

By showing how and when guests use a site, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. We use the information from cookies to provide services better tailored to our users needs.

Epilepsy.com has two primary uses for its cookies. First, we use them to specify unique preferences. Secondly, we use cookies to track user trends and patterns. This helps us better understand and improve areas of the epilepsy.com service that our users find valuable. While both of these activities depend on the use of a "cookie," visitors to epilepsy.com always have the option of disabling cookies via their browser preferences.

Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, note that some parts of the epilepsy.com service will not function properly or may be considerably slower if you refuse cookies. For example, without cookies, you will not be able to set personalized news preferences or you may have difficulty completing shopping transactions, entering contests, or playing games.

You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers. Epilepsy.com does not control these cookies. The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry.

LINKS TO OTHER SITES

Users should be aware that when you are on epilepsy.com , you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There are links to other sites from epilepsy.com pages that take you outside our service. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data or solicit personal information.

Please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information online --- for example, via message boards or chat --- that information can be collected and used by people you don't know. While epilepsy.com strives to protect its user's personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online and you do so at your own risk.

Epilepsy.com 's policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond epilepsy.com 's control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation.

SECURITY

The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our guests is of utmost concern to us. We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from your PC to our servers. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, epilepsy.com can't ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.

YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS

By using this site, you signify your assent to the epilepsy.com [Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20021215084320id_/http%3A//www.epilepsy.com/epilepsy/privacy_policy.html). If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our sites. Your continued use of the epilepsy.com sites following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.

SAFETY TIPS

This is a great place for both new and advanced Web users to find information on using the Internet wisely.

INTERNET SAFETY TIPS

  1. Keep your passwords private, even from your best friend! Your online service will never ask for them, so neither should anyone else.
  2. Use only your member name and/or e-mail address when chatting or sending e-mail. Never give out personal information like your name, address, or phone number.
  3. Always delete unknown e-mail attachments before opening them. They can contain destructive viruses.
  4. Remember that nothing you write on the Web is completely private - including e-mail. So be careful and think about what you type and who you tell.
  5. Not everyone is as nice, cute and funny as they may sound online. Never make plans to meet an online "friend" in person.
