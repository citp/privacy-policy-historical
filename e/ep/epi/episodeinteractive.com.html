                            <p>A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk, generally to quickly identify a user’s computer and to “remember” things about the user’s visit, such as your preferences or a user name and password. The Service sends cookies to your computer when you access or view content of a Episode Interactive game. Information contained in a cookie may be linked to your personal information for purposes such as improving the quality of our Service, tailoring recommendations to your interests, and making the Service easier to use. You can disable cookies at any time, although you may not be able to access or use features of the Service.</p>
                            <p>We may feature advertisements served by third party advertising companies which deliver cookies to your computer so the ads you see can be tracked. Since the third party advertising companies tag your computer with a number, they will be able to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement. These advertisers may use information about your visits to our Service in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.</p>

                            <h5>Web Beacons</h5>
                            <p>We may collect information using Web beacons. Web beacons or “gifs”, are electronic images that may be used on our Site or in our emails. We may use Web beacons to deliver cookies, count visits and to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.</p>

                            <h5>Disclosure of Your Personal Information</h5>
                            <p>Episode Interactive does not share your personal information except as approved by you or as described below:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>With your consent, for example, when you agree to our sharing your information with other third parties for their own marketing purposes subject to their separate privacy policies.</li>
                                <li>Episode Interactive may engage other companies and individuals to perform services on our behalf. Examples of these services include sending e-mails to you and analyzing data.</li>
                                <li>We may release your information as permitted by law or when we believe that release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our rights; or protect the rights, property, or safety of us or our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection.</li>
                                <li>Episode Interactive may share your information in connection with any bankruptcy, merger, sale of our assets, or a financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</li>
                                <li>We may share aggregate or anonymous information about you with advertisers, publishers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h5>Third Party Tools/Analytics</h5>
                            <li>The Service may also contain third party tracking tools from third party service providers, which may enable these third parties to analyze our users’ information. These third parties may have access to your personal information in connection with the performance of services for Episode Interactive.</li>

                            <h5>Advertisements</h5>
                            <p>You may see our games advertised in other applications or websites. After clicking on one of these advertisements and installing our game, you will become a user of the Service. A device identifier and in game or user session activity may be shared with the advertiser.</p>
                            <p>We may use a third-party ad tracking service, MobileAppTracking, for tracking installs resulting from advertisements on other applications or sites. Please visit <a href="http://www.mobileapptracking.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">http://www.mobileapptracking.com/privacy-policy/</a> to see what type of information MobileAppTracking is collecting and using.  You may opt out of such tracking by visiting <a href="https://optoutmobile.com/optOut" target="_blank">https://optoutmobile.com/optOut</a>. If you choose to opt out by visiting such web address, that action is specific to the tracking for such third party ad tracking.</p>
                            <p>You may see an “offer wall” displayed in our games that is hosted by an offer wall provider. The offer wall enables advertisers to provide virtual currency to you in exchange for interacting with an advertisement or for completing a marketing offer with one of those advertisers. The offer wall providers may collect information about you, including a device identifier, device type, device brand, device model, OS type/version, network type, device language, device locale, and IP address. In addition, the offer wall provider may collect information related to the performance of the advertisements such as how many times an advertisement is shown, how long an advertisement is viewed, and any click-throughs of an advertisement.</p>
                            <p>In addition, Episode Interactive may have advertisements in its games regarding other applications or services that are served by third parties. These third parties may collect and use information about you, including platform, application and OS version, device identifiers, Media Access Control (MAC) address, International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI), Service user session activity, device usage information and general location information, such as locale (specific location where a given language is spoken), mobile network code/mobile country code, and time zone, to show advertising of interest to you. For example, Facebook serves advertising in certain of our applications and may target such advertisements based on information Facebook has collected from you. You can opt-out of such targeted advertisements by using Apple’s “Limit Ad Tracking” setting described here.  You can opt-out of interest based ads served by InMobi by downloading and using the Truste Ad Privacy Manager mobile application. Certain video ads are displayed in our games that are served by partners such as Ad Colony, Flurry, Applovin and Vungle and which may target users based on certain information that such third party has obtained regarding users. You can opt out of Ad Colony targeted advertising by visiting <a href="http://privacy.adcolony.com/opt-out" target="_blank">http://privacy.adcolony.com/opt-out</a>, can opt out of Flurry targeted advertising by visiting <a href="http://www.flurry.com/user-opt-out.html" target="_blank">http://www.flurry.com/user-opt-out.html</a>, opt out of Applovin targeted advertising by following the instructions at <a href="https://www.applovin.com/optout" target="_blank">https://www.applovin.com/optout</a>, and opt out of Vungle targeted advertising by following the instructions available here <a href="http://www.vungle.com/privacy/" target="_blank">http://www.vungle.com/privacy/</a>. Such third parties serving advertisements may also collect information related to the performance of the advertisements such as how many times an advertisement is shown, how long an advertisement is viewed, and any click-throughs of an advertisement.</p>

We may engage third parties, such as marketing or analytics partners, who may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you use our website.</p>

                            <h5>International Transfer</h5>
                            <p>We may transfer information that we collect about you to affiliated entities, or to other third parties across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that you are transferring information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. and the use and disclosure of information about you, including personal information, as described in this Policy.</p>
