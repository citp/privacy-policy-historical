The information we request for you to participate in these features may include personally identifiable information such as name, address, telephone and fax numbers, and email address, as well as "demographic" information such as your hobbies or personal preferences. We will tell you at the time we collect information whether the information requested is necessary for you to participate in a particular feature. 

The information we collect is used to respond to your specific requests, to send you periodic information and special offers from **Hanley Wood** and our sponsors, to provide you with updates on **Hanley Wood** offerings and features, to provide you with product information from manufacturers in our database, to provide notice of changes to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, and to provide our sponsors with aggregate data about our users. The information you provide is also used to understand users' interests and behavior, and may be combined with information **Hanley Wood** may have from other online or offline sources.

IP addresses are collected for system administration purposes and for studying how people use our site and how we can improve it. **Hanley Wood** uses cookies to identify registered web site users and to automatically give them access to "member only" content areas such as articles and reports, and to provide them with access to previously-stored information. **Hanley Wood** also uses cookies to estimate our audience size and usage patterns and to track the aggregate number of customer returns at our web site.
