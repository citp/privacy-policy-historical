**Information Collected by our Servers.** To make the Game more useful to you, our Website automatically tracks certain information about the visits to our Website, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, clickstream data, referring/exist pages, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Website, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and to improve the Game, as well as for product development purposes.

**Cookies.** Like a typical online game or service, we use cookies to collect information. "Cookies" are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience while playing and using the Game. This type of information is collected to make the Game more useful to you and to tailor your experience with us to meet your special interests and expectations. 

**Pixel Tags.** In addition, we may use "Pixel Tags", also known, among other names, as Web beacons. Pixel tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies, that are used to track online movements of web users. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a computer’s hard drive or web browser, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in web pages. Pixel Tags also allow us to send email messages in a format that users can read, and tell us if emails have been opened to, in part, ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users. 

For further information about cookies, including how to refuse cookies, please visit www.allaboutcookies.org. 

**Data Collected in Connection with Advertising.** We may use third parties to serve ads on the Website and in the Applications. In connection with the delivery of advertising, certain third parties may automatically collect information about your visits to this and other websites, your IP address, your ISP, the browser you use to access the Game. They do this by using Cookies, Pixel Tags, or other technologies. Information collected may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of our Website and the other sites tracked by these third parties. This Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, Cookies or Pixel Tags in third party ads, and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of Cookies and other technologies. 

If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices.

Examples of information that may be collected and used include how you use the Application(s), and information about the type of device you use, your device operating system, etc.

**Third Party Analytics.** We use a number of third party service providers, such as Google Analytics, to help analyze how users use our services. These third party service providers use Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit our Website, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Game. We use this information we receive from these companies to improve our Game and your user experience.

**Referral Affiliates.** We may enter into agreements with companies that refer users to the Game by way of hyperlinks made available on the referring party’s website. We may automatically collect certain information, such as [your IP address, referring website, and your IP address] via the Cookies and Pixel Tags that are provided to us in connection with your use of the referring party’s website.

We may collect the email addresses and other information you provide in order to facilitate such invitations.
