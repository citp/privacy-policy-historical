            <p></p>
            <p>
                Our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Information described above will depend on the
                personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally
                collect Personal Information from you only where:
                <br>
                </p><ul class="epoch-padding-left-small">
                    <li>We have your consent to do so</li>
                    <li>We need the personal information to perform a contract with you</li>
                    <li>The processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights or</li>
                    <li>We have a legal obligation to collect Personal Information from you</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                "Legitimate interests" means the interests of our company in conducting and managing our business to
                enable us to give you the best service/products and the best and most secure experience. For example: we
                have an interest in keeping our network secure. It can also apply to processing that is in your interests as
                well. For example: we may process your Personal Information to protect you against fraud when
                transacting on our website. We process Personal Information for certain legitimate business purposes,
                which include some or all of the following:
                <br>
                <ul class="epoch-padding-left-small">
                    <li>To enhance, modify, personalize or otherwise improve our services/communications for the benefit of our customers</li>
                    <li>To identify and prevent fraud</li>
                    <li>To enhance the security of our network and information systems</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                When processing your Personal Information for our legitimate interests, we make sure to consider and
                balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights under the data protection
                laws. Our legitimate business interests do not automatically override your interests – we will not use your
                Personal Information for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have
                your consent or are otherwise required or permitted by law). If you have any concerns about the
                processing, you have the right to object to processing that is based on our legitimate interests. For more
                information on your rights, please see “Your Rights” section below.

                We protect Personal Information by maintaining physical,

                applicable US federal and state regulations. We use computer
                safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we enforce
                physical access controls to our buildings and files, and we
                authorize access to personal information only for those
