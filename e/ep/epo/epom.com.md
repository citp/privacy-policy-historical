Epom.com Privacy Policy is determined by the following core aspects:

### Personal Data Receipt

We require registration at Epom from everybody who wants to gain access to the platform and use its features. The registration process presupposes providing personal information, including full name, contact details, etc. Any of this information may be used for Epom internal purposes only. Users' contact details will not be shared with, sold to or accessible to any third party, being used only for communication between a user and Epom administrators.

The cookie does NOT include user's name, address, phone number, e-mail address, or any other private information. Cookies are relevant to our servers for recognizing the authorized users, so that users can browse the site without being repeatedly asked for authorization.

Together with cookies Epom.com uses pixel tags which allow the operator of the web page or other document, or a third party who serves the pixel tag, to set, read, and modify cookies. Pixel tags and cookies can't threaten Epom.com users' security as they do NOT track any private information.

### Referrer URL

Referrer URLs are used to estimate the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. Referrer URLs allow Epom.com to determine on which website the advertisements of our clients are displayed. Referrer URLs do not collect any personal information which may identify the user later on, so usage of Referrer URLs cannot threaten the user's security in any way.

Anonymous information which doesn't include any personal data, e.g. user's IP address, the entered search keyword, etc., is gathered automatically. The anonymous information, which doesn't include any personal data of a user is gathered automatically, e.g. IP address is logged to help us identify any unauthorized access to your account.
