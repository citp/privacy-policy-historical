# Epoch - Credit Card Processing and Customer Billing Support - Privacy Policy

#### PRIVACY POLICY

Online and off-line privacy is constantly evolving and Epoch plans to take all reasonable efforts to maintain up to date and effective privacy standards and practices. You may also contact us at [legal@epoch.com](mailto:legal@epoch.com) with any questions or concerns that you may have.

Epoch is committed to respecting your privacy and recognizes the need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you share with us. In order to provide payment processing, billing, customer service and fraud detection services (collectively "Services"), Epoch collects and uses your Personal Information.

If you choose to provide us with your Personal Information through our website ("Website") and/or through documents provided during your initial account setup and at any point thereafter, we may transfer your Personal Information within Epoch (its parent company and/or any subsidiaries) or to third parties, across borders, and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

Epoch strives to comply with all applicable laws around the globe that are designed to protect your privacy. Although legal requirements may vary from country to country, Epoch intends to adhere to the principles set forth in this Privacy Policy even if, in connection with the above, we transfer your Personal Information from your country to countries that may not require an "adequate" level of protection for your Personal Information. In other words, our goal is to provide protection for your Personal Information no matter where that Personal Information is collected, transferred, or retained.

To protect your privacy, we have adopted the following principles:

* Notice  
* Choice  
* Security  
* Access/Accuracy  


##### NOTICE

**Information Collection And Use**

You may access and browse our Website without disclosing any Personal Information. However, if you attempt to retain Epoch's Services for your websites and/or to purchase a product or service online, Epoch may request that you voluntarily supply it with Personal Information. Personal Information we collect and how we use it is as follows:

  * **Registration information** \- When you sign up or use our Services, we ask for your personal information so that we can provide you with our Services. If you are a customer purchasing a product or service online using our Services, you may be required to provide your name, credit or debit card number, card expiration date, card verification code (CVV), address, username/password and email address. If you are a merchant or an affiliate of an Epoch merchant attempting to retain our Services for your websites, you may also be required to provide your bank account number, your personal address, your business details, and a government-issued identification number (for example, social security number or taxpayer identification number for U.S. residents). We may also ask you to send us additional documentation or to answer additional questions to help verify your information.
  * **Information obtained from third parties** \- In order to protect you from fraud or other misconduct, we may obtain information about you from third parties to verify the information you provide. For example, we may use card authorization and fraud screening services to verify that your credit or debit card information and address match the information that you provided to us. Also, for merchants, we may obtain information about you and your business from a credit bureau or other sources such as public records or private business information services.
  * **Transaction information** \- When you use our Services to purchase a product or service online, we collect information about each transaction, including the transaction amount, a description of the goods or services being purchased, your name, username/password and the payment information.
  * **Log information** \- When you use our Services, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
  * **User communications** \- When you send e-mail or other communication to us, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our Services.



Epoch uses a secure transmission method for all of its transmissions. Epoch receives and stores all information that you enter/provide through our Website, e-mail, fascimile or regular mail. You are required to provide Epoch with accurate and up to date information, and your failure to accurately provide such information could result in the voiding of your agreement(s) with Epoch.

Epoch is the sole owner of the information collected. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to third parties, except as set forth in this Privacy Policy. We will not use any of your Personal Information to send you any promotional materials or advertisements. If you are a merchant or an affiliate of an Epoch merchant, you may from time to time receive from us important updates about our Services. If you are an affiliate of an Epoch merchant, you may also receive from us important updates about services of the Epoch merchant(s) for which you are an affiliate. If you are a customer, you may receive from us order/cancellation e-mail confirmations that are automatically generated whenever an order/cancellation is placed through us and that confirm your purchase or cancellation with important details about your purchase or cancellation, including but not limited to, product purchased/cancelled, order/cancellation date, username/password and our customer service toll free telephone number that may be used for any inquiries about the purchase/cancellation.

**Information Sharing**

We ensure that your Personal Information will not be disclosed to anyone other than:

  * Epoch's affiliated merchant banks and credit card associations as required to process a transaction and provide our Services to you;
  * Epoch's merchant(s) from which you have purchased a product or service online using our Services;
  * Companies that we may merge with or be acquired by. (Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new entity follow this Privacy Policy with respect to your Personal Information. If your Personal Information could be used contrary to this Privacy Policy, you will receive prior notice.);
  * Law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties when (a) we are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order or similar legal procedure; (b) we need to do so to comply with law; and (c) we believe in good faith that the disclosure of Personal Information is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report suspected illegal activity, or to investigate violations of our agreement(s);
  * Other third parties with your consent or direction to do so.



##### CHOICE

You may choose whether or not to provide Personal Information to Epoch. If you choose not to provide the Personal Information we request, you can still visit most of Epoch's Website, but you will be unable to purchase a product or service online, setup an account with us and/or use our Services for your websites. If you chose to have a relationship with Epoch, such as a contractual or other business relationship, you will be required to provide Personal Information in connection with such relationship.

##### SECURITY

We have implemented security policies, rules and technical measures to protect the Personal Information that we have under our control from unauthorized access, improper use or disclosure, unauthorized modification, unlawful destruction or accidental loss. Epoch utilizes Secure Socket Layer (SSL) software when receiving and transmitting information electronically.

We protect Personal Information by maintaining physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in compliance with applicable US federal and state regulations. We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we enforce physical access controls to our buildings and files, and we authorize access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities.

Finally, your Personal Information is disposed by shredding paper records and by the use of the shred tool that ensures that any and all electronically stored files are permanently removed from hard disks and any other electronic media which are then also physically destroyed before being disposed.

Epoch reserves the right to refuse any request for information, though it will communicate the reason for its decision.

**Accuracy**

To the extent that you do provide us with Personal Information, Epoch wishes to maintain accurate Personal Information. When we collect Personal Information from you, our goal is to provide means of contacting us should you need to update or correct that Personal Information.
