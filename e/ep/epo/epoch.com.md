#### PRIVACY POLICY

Online privacy is constantly evolving and Epoch plans to take all reasonable efforts to maintain up to date and effective online privacy standards and practices. We have linked every page of our website ("Website") to this page for your convenience and you may also contact us at [legal@epoch.com](mailto:legal@epoch.com) with any questions or concerns that you may have. 

Epoch is committed to respecting your online privacy and recognizes the need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you share with us. In order to provide payment processing, billing and fraud detection services, Epoch collects and uses your Personal Information. Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a home or other physical address and an email address or other contact information, whether at work or at home, payment information, and website usernames/passwords. This policy explains how we intend to treat your Personal Information. 

If you choose to provide us with your Personal Information on our Website, we may transfer your Personal Information within Epoch or to Epoch's Third-Parties, across borders, and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. 

Epoch strives to comply with all applicable laws around the globe that are designed to protect your privacy. Although legal requirements may vary from country to country, Epoch intends to adhere to the principles set forth in this Privacy Policy even if, in connection with the above, we transfer your Personal Information from your country to countries that may not require an "adequate" level of protection for your Personal Information. In other words, our goal is to provide protection for your Personal Information no matter where that Personal Information is collected, transferred, or retained. 

To protect your privacy, we have adopted the following principles:

* Notice  
* Choice  
* Security  
* Access/Accuracy
