**The purpose for processing personal data about you**  
(‘Processing’ means anything Epson does with the information about you including gathering it, holding it, using it and disclosing it.)  
The primary purpose for which Epson will process your personal data is for the marketing of its products, including direct marketing communications to you.

**This includes:**

  * identifying you when you contact us
  * monitoring your preferences so that you can save time when searching our website
  * processing your requests to participate in marketing promotions
  * monitoring and recording phone and written communications with you for quality assurance and compliance purposes and for dealing with your complaints and queries
  * understanding which parts of Epson’s website, and which products and services, most interest you



The legal basis for this is that it is necessary for the legitimate interests of Epson or companies within the Epson group in carrying out marketing activities.

If you choose to give information beyond that which Epson requires you to provide, the basis for processing that information is your consent as demonstrated by your voluntarily providing it. You have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. You can do this by writing to Epson at the address shown above, or at [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/contact-us).

As part of its processing, Epson will perform some automated profiling and decision-making based on the information it holds about you in order to make information presented to you more relevant to your interests.

If, in the future, Epson wishes to process your data for some other purpose it will first provide you with information about that other purpose.

Where you have given your consent to this, Epson will also use your personal data for the purpose of electronic marketing communications to you (normally by e-mail) which may include :

  * conducting surveys and asking your opinion on our products and services
  * notifying you of products or offers that may be of interest to you
  * notifying you of promotions such as free gifts, contests and prize draws.
  * marketing analysis and customer profiling
  * invitations to events



The legal basis for this is your specific consent. You may withdraw your consent to this additional purpose (independently of your right to object to Epson processing data for the general purposes described above) at any time by writing to Epson at the address shown above, or at [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/contact-us).

Epson will hold your personal data for a period of 2 years after the last contact from you. After that time some information may be held but only in an anonymised form or as part of archived records.

Epson uses third parties to perform some processing activities on its behalf. Some or all of your personal data may be disclosed to them, but they are only permitted to use the disclosed data for the purposes for which Epson holds your data and in accordance with Epson’s directions.

As a “data subject” you have statutory rights to request from Epson access to and rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing concerning yourself or to object to processing as well as the right to data portability and the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.

If you are located outside the EU Epson will transfer some of your personal data, outside the EU, to Epson group staff in the region concerned and to contractors in that region used by Epson to provide services. This will be subject to the protections required by law.
