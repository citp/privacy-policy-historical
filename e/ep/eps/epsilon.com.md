In addition, Epsilon automatically collects certain information from your computer and stores it in log files.

We do this to improve services we offer you, and to improve marketing, analytics, or site functionality. You must be 18 years of age or older to submit registration information to our Sites.

 **Epsilon Information Use Practices**  
Epsilon will use the personal information collected to market to you per the preferences you specified when you registered on our Sites. Our marketing efforts include business-to-business direct marketing and promotional information related to Epsilon’s marketing services.

Cookies are small text files that store data using your web browser to make your browsing experience easier and faster.

We use Performance and Functionality cookies, as described below, to improve the performance of our Sites and to make our Sites more user-friendly.

Epsilon respects enhanced user privacy controls. We support the development and implementation of a standard “do not track” browser feature, which provides customers with control over the collection and use of information by third parties regarding their web-browsing activities. At this time Epsilon does not respond to DNT mechanisms. Once a standardized “do not track” feature is released, Epsilon intends to adhere to the browser settings accordingly.

The European Union Directive 2009/136/EC, amending Directive 2002/58/EC on Privacy and Electronic Communications (otherwise known as the e-Privacy or Cookie Directive), and laws in EU countries implementing such Directive require user consent before a site may place cookies and other similar technologies on your device or to use such technologies to access information on your device.

 **Online Targeted Advertising**

As you browse the internet, you may see advertisements on the web pages you visit. Some of these ads are targeted based on a variety of factors, such as websites you visit, perceived interests, and demographic information. This practice is called Online Targeted Advertising. We work with advertising partners to enable the delivery of relevant messages to the right consumers while protecting consumer privacy and offering choices about participating in such activities. Our third party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you with Online Targeting Advertising. Our Sites may also engage in Online Targeted Advertising and when visiting our international Sites, where required, you will see a notice that provides information on our use of cookies on that specific Site. Online Targeted Advertising does not result in more ads, rather the ads you see will be more relevant to you.
