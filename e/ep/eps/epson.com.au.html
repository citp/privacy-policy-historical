			<h1>Epson Australia's Privacy Policy</h1>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<p>Epson Australia Pty Limited ("Epson") understands that your privacy is important and recognizes the importance of respecting customer privacy over the Internet.</p>

When you visit the "Members Section" of a Site after registration, your membership number and password will identify you. You will be free to change your Personal Information or to ask for it to be removed from our membership database.</p>

			<h2>Use of Personal Information</h2>

			<p>If you choose to give us Personal Information, Epson may use it to support our customer relationship with you.</p>

			<p>For example, we may post or email to you announcements of Epson product upgrades, special offers, competitions, promotions and other new products and services from Epson.</p>

			<p>Please note that Epson will not share, rent, sell or otherwise disclose your Personal Information to any other companies or organizations.</p>

			<p>However, Epson may disclose general information about its customers and Site members to third parties such as advertisers and business partners. For example, we might disclose that a certain percent of Site users is in a particular age bracket or is a PC or Macintosh user.</p>

			<p>We will not disclose Personal Information to third parties without first seeking your consent, unless we are required by law to do so, for example by a government agency. We may also give your address details to third parties (such as couriers, Australia Post or promotions fulfillment houses, to allow them to deliver a prize or reward to you.)
			Security of Your Personal Information</p>

			<p>We will take reasonable steps to keep your Personal Information confidential and to protect it from misuse, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.</p>

			<p>We have implemented and will maintain proper standards of technology and operational security to protect your Personal Information.</p>
