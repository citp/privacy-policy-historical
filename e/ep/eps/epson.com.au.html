		<h3>EPSON Australia's Privacy Policy</h3>

		<strong>Introduction</strong><br>
		
		<p>EPSON Australia Pty Limited ("EPSON") understands that your privacy is important and recognizes the importance of respecting customer privacy over the Internet.</p>
		
		<p>Within our main site (www.epson.com.au) and other sites that we operate ("Sites") EPSON may collect information that can personally identify you ("Personal Information").</p>
		
		<p>In this Privacy Statement, we explain the circumstances in which we may collect Personal Information and how we may use it.</p>

We may also give your address details to third parties (such as couriers, Australia Post or promotions fulfillment houses, for them to fullfil the delivery of a prize or reward.)</p>
		
		<strong>Security of Your Information</strong><br>
		
		<p>We will take reasonable steps to keep your Personal Information confidential and to protect it from misuse, unauthorised access or modification or disclosure.</p>
