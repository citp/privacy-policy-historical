**4\. Must personal data be disclosed when visiting Epson websites?**  
You can access most parts of our websites without telling us who you are or providing other personal data. However some services and parts of our websites do require this.

  * conduct appropriate checks for creditworthiness

  * when legally required to do so, for example in legal proceedings;
  * where it is necessary to comply with applicable laws and regulations;
