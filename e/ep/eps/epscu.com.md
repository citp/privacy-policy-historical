Payment Systems for Credit Unions, Inc. (PSCU) is one of the largest 24x7 call centers and transaction card service providers for credit unions in the U.S. In addition, PSCU is the largest credit union service organization (CUSO) in the nation. PSCU is a cooperative organization dedicated to promoting the success of our members by delivering financial services, technology through its ePSCU division, and operational support exclusively for credit unions.

PSCU and ePSCU intend for pscu.net and epscu.com to complement the services that each organization respectively provides. Collectively PSCU and ePSCU believe that online security and privacy are important to the future success of the Internet and electronic commerce. We also believe that online security and privacy are important to our member credit unions and to their members as well.

PSCU and ePSCU have a strong commitment to the issues of trust and privacy on the World Wide Web as demonstrated by our agreement with ICSA.net, the worldwide leader in Internet security assurance services, to provide TruSecure™ certification for PSCU's security policies and technical internetworking infrastructure.

We are committed to guarding your data, protecting your members' privacy, and developing technology that gives consumers the most powerful, safe, online experience available anywhere.

After all, isn't that what you expect from us?

**Privacy**

Should you merely visit either site, pscu.net or epscu.com, we do not collect any personal information about you. Should you decide you would like additional information about PSCU or ePSCU, you will be asked to register online. During registration the information disclosed is retained, such as your name and email address. 

We also request and retain during registration other demographic information such as address, credit union affiliation and purpose for your visit. We use demographic information in the aggregate only for statistical analysis and internal research purposes to help us understand who is using our site and become better equipped to serve your needs. **Neither PSCU nor ePSCU sells, distributes or discloses your personally identifiable information collected at registration to any third parties.**

Our website may contain links to other websites. Accordingly, neither PSCU nor ePSCU can be responsible for the privacy practices or the content of the linked websites and encourages you to read the privacy statement of any linked websites to become acquainted with their specific privacy practices.

ePSCU's _InfoLink_ site for credit card data currently accepts user ID, password, credit card account number(s), and zip code(s). Future versions of this site may accept other types of information (SSN, mother's maiden name, birthdate, e-mail addresses, etc.) that allow the site to verify the credit union members' access privileges.

Any information credit union members provide to register or use any of ePSCU Internet product sites will be used only as required to enable the members' registration or use of the sites. The information members provide is stored in ePSCU data center computers in a secure environment. Any e-mail addresses that credit union members provide or will provide on the site are for supporting communication between the credit union member and ePSCU's call center representatives.
