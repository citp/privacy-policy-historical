In general, you can visit the Site without telling us who you are or providing any information about yourself. In some areas of the Site, we ask you to provide information that will enable us to process an order, offer services that require registration, assist you with technical support issues or to follow up with you. Generally, Epson requests identifying information when you:

  1. Register on any of our web site.
  2. Place an order or request notification of order status.
  3. Provide feedback to an online survey or tell us about an idea or suggestion.
  4. Participate in a rebate programme, contest, or other promotional offer.
  5. Register to receive mailings, such as a product catalog, or e-mail notification such as when a product will become available.
  6. Register an Epson product.
  7. Request information or files from technical support or customer service.



In these instances, Epson will ask for your name, address, e-mail address, phone number and other appropriate information needed to provide you with these services. In all instances, if you receive a newsletter or other mailing from us, you will always be able to "unsubscribe" to these mailings at any time as described in the Opting-Out section below.

Epson does not share, rent, or sell any personally identifying information provided through this Site (such as your name or email address) to any outside organisation for use in its marketing or solicitations. From time to time Epson may use agents or contractors who will have access to your personal information to perform services for Epson (such as a database management service), however, they are required by us to keep the information confidential and may not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services for Epson. In addition, Epson may also share aggregate information about its customers and its web site visitors to advertisers, business partners, and other third parties. For example, we might share that our users are x percent PCs users and y percent Macintosh users. None of this information, however, will contain personal, identifying information about our users.
