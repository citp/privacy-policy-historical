We will not disclose Personal Information to third parties without first seeking your consent unless we are required by law to do so, for example to a government agency. We may also give your address details to third parties (such as couriers, Australia Post or promotions fulfillment houses, for them to fullfil the delivery of a prize or reward.)

**Security of Your Information**

We will take reasonable steps to keep your Personal Information confidential and to protect it from misuse, unauthorised access or modification or disclosure.

We have implemented and will maintain proper standards of technology and operational security to protect your Personal Information.
