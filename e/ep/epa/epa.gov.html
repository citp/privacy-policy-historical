			<h2>About Privacy and Security</h2>
			<p>Thank you for visiting the Environmental Protection Agency Web site, a
			  service of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. This statement informs
			  you how we will handle information we learn about you from your visit to
			  our site. Please be assured that the privacy of our visitors is of utmost
			  importance to us. We collect no personally identifiable information about
			  you when you visit our site unless you choose to provide that information
			  to us. </p>
			<p>We want to inform you that, for each HTTP request (which is what your Web
			  browser generates when you request a page or part of a page from a Web site)
			  received, we collect and store only the following information, in what is
			  called a log file: </p>
			<ul>
              <li> the date and time</li>
              <li> the originating Internet Provider address (IPA) (this address
                can refer to a specific computer; more frequently, commercial
                Internet providers use a temporary IPA which does not link to
                a specific computer)</li>
              <li> the type of browser and operating system used (if provided
                by the browser) </li>
              <li> the URL of the referring page (if provided by the browser)</li>
              <li> the object requested </li>
              <li> completion status of the request </li>
              <li> pages visited </li>
		  </ul>
			<p>We use the information that we automatically collect to measure the number
			  of visitors to the different areas of our sites, and to help us make our
			  pages more useful to visitors. This includes analyzing these logs periodically
			  to determine the traffic through our servers, the number of pages served,
			  and the level of demand for pages and topics of interest. </p>
			<p id="long"><strong>How Long is the Information Retained</strong>:
			  The logs for each day, with no personal information, are maintained indefinitely. </p>
			<p id="Cookies"><strong>Cookies</strong>: EPA does not use "persistent
			  cookies" or any other persistent tracking methods to collect personally
			  identifiable information about visitors to our Web pages. However, some
			  EPA pages have “session cookies,” to facilitate use of that
			  particular page. These disappear when the Web user terminates a Web session
			  and closes the browser. </p>
			<p>Cookies are small files that Web servers place on a user's hard drive.
			  They can serve several functions, depending upon how they are designed:</p>
			<ul>
              <li> they allow the Web site to identify you as a previous visitor
                each time you access a site;</li>
              <li> they track what information you view at a site (important
                to commercial sites trying to determine your buying preferences); </li>
              <li> in the more advanced cases they track your movements through
                many Web sites but not the whole Web; </li>
              <li> businesses use them for customer convenience to allow them
                to produce a list of items to buy and pay for them all at one
                time and to garner information about what individuals are buying
                at their sites;</li>
              <li> advertisers use them to determine the effectiveness of their
                marketing and offer insights into consumer preferences and tastes
                by collecting data from many Web sites; and </li>
              <li> they can be used to help a Web site tailor screens for each
                customer's preference. </li>
		  </ul>
			<p>To protect your privacy, be sure to close your browser completely after
			  you have finished conducting business with a Web site that does use cookies.
			  If you are concerned about the potential use of the information gathered
			  from your computer by cookies, you can set your browser to prompt you before
			  it accepts a cookie. Most Internet browsers have settings that let you identify
			  and/or reject cookies. </p>
			<p id="other"><strong>Other Information Collection</strong>: In addition
			  to the information automatically collected by the server, EPA offices may
			  collect other information from online visitors. Before collecting personally
			  identifiable information through our Web pages, we will prominently disclose: </p>
			<ul>
              <li> why EPA is collecting the information; </li>
              <li> what information is to be collected;</li>
              <li> the intended use of the information;</li>
              <li> how it will be protected/secured;</li>
              <li> if it will be shared within or outside EPA, including on publicly
                available Web sites;</li>
              <li> if shared, with whom;</li>
              <li> the opportunity to consent to, or reject, the collection and/or
                sharing, and</li>
              <li> when it will be destroyed.</li>
		  </ul>
			<p id="how"><strong>How the Information is Used</strong>: We may
			  store <strong>non-personally identifiable information</strong> we collect
			  (such as search engine queries and anonymous survey responses) indefinitely
			  to help us better understand and meet the needs of our visitors. We may
			  share <strong>non-personally identifiable information</strong> with others,
			  including the public, in aggregated form (for instance, in a list of our
			  most popular search engine queries), in partial or edited form (such as
			  in a report summarizing responses to a questionnaire), or verbatim (for
			  example, in a complete listing of survey responses).</p>
			<p id="rights"><strong>Your Rights under the Privacy Act</strong>:
			  The Privacy Act of 1974 protects the personal information the federal government
			  keeps on you in “systems of records (SOR)” (information an agency
			  controls that can be retrieved by name or some other personal identifier).
			  The Privacy Act regulates how the government can disclose, share, provide
			  access to, and maintain the personal information that it collects. Not all
			  information collected online is covered by the Privacy Act.</p>
			<p>The Act’s major provisions require agencies to:</p>
			<ul>
              <li> publish a Privacy Act Notice in the Federal Register explaining
                the existence, character and uses of a new or revised SOR; </li>
              <li> keep information about you accurate, relevant, timely, and
                complete to assure fairness in dealing with you; and </li>
              <li> allow you to, upon request, access and review your information
                held in a SOR and request amendment of the information if you
                disagree with it. </li>
		  </ul>
			<p>EPA Web pages do not collect any personal information that is contained
			  in a Privacy Act System of Records as defined by the Privacy Act. Information
			  concerning the Privacy Act can be found at: <a href="http://www.epa.gov/privacy/index.htm">http://www.epa.gov/privacy/index.htm</a>.</p>
			<p id="kids"><strong>Interaction with Children</strong>: Some EPA
			  Web pages provide content to children. It is EPA policy, in compliance with
			  the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA),
			  to collect no information online about or from children age 13 and under
			  except when it is needed to identify a submission or to answer a question.
			  Any such instances on Web pages for children will be clearly marked, and
			  a separate privacy notice will be posted on that Web page. Under no circumstances
			  will any of the information be used for another purpose or shared with third
			  parties, nor will personally identifying information be published on the
			  EPA Web site.</p>
			<p id="email"><strong>How e-mail is Handled</strong>: By sending
			  us an electronic mail message (for example, an e-mail message containing
			  an official Freedom of Information Act request), you may be sending us personally-identifying
			  information, such as name and address. In these cases, we may retain the
			  information as long as necessary to respond to your request or otherwise
			  resolve the subject matter of your e-mail. Please be aware that email is
			  not necessarily secure from 3rd party interception or misdirection. For
			  your own protection you may wish to communicate sensitive information using
			  a method other than email.</p>
			<p id="forms"><strong>Personal Information via Forms</strong>: Some
			  of our pages provide forms allowing visitors to submit search engine queries,
			  questionnaires, feedback, or other information. Some of these forms may
			  request personally identifiable information (e.g., name, address, e-mail
			  address) for specific purposes, such as when the submitter is requesting
			  a personal response, registering for a conference, or subscribing to a mailing
			  list. <strong>All information submitted by visitors is voluntary.</strong></p>
			<p id="site"><strong>Site Security</strong>: For site security purposes
			  and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, EPA does
			  employ software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized
			  attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage to the
			  information on our Web pages. Unauthorized attempts to upload information
			  or change information on this service (“hacking”) are strictly
			  prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act
			  of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act. Except
			  for these authorized law enforcement investigations, no other attempts are
			  made to identify individual users or their usage habits.</p>
