EPAM will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes it was collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, EPAM considers the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which EPAM processes your personal information and whether it can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

However, EPAM has taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy, including, utilizing the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between its group companies, which requires all group companies to protect personal information being processed from the European Economic Area to an equivalent standard to that required under European Union data protection law.

######  Information Security 

EPAM protects your personal information in the same way that it protects its other confidential information, such as storing it on secure servers that only select EPAM personnel have access to, and by encrypting it to help prevent access by any unauthorized parties. EPAM has put in place procedures to deal with any personal information breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach when legally required to do so.
