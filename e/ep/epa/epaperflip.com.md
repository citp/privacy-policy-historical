# Privacy Policy - DCatalog

DCatalog, Inc. is doing business as DCatalog, hereinafter referred to as DCatalog. DCatalog service and related services, applications, domains and networks offered by DCatalog (“DCatalog service”). The DCatalog service allows you to connect, collaborate, share, and remix documents with other users of the DCatalog service community on the Internet. DCatalog’s Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how we collect and use the personal information you decide to share, and help you make informed decisions when using the DCatalog service. By using or accessing the DCatalog service, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy

###  **Information Gathered by DCatalog:**

For visitors to our website and registered users, we log standard technical information, such as your IP address. If you choose to register with us, DCatalog requires you to provide your name, email address, and each user has a user ID and password that they choose. To maintain privacy it is important not to share your password with anyone. Selecting a longer password with a mix of letters, numbers and symbols makes it more difficult for others to guess your password. It is also helpful to change passwords on a regular basis. In addition, DCatalog will require you to provide geographical information such as your physical address. In the future DCatalog may ask you to provide other demographic information, such as age, gender, interests or occupation, as well as credit card information for verification purposes.

We may collect other personal information when you provide feedback or comments, or communicate with others through our systems. DCatalog also uses “cookies” – small files containing a string of characters sent to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser – in addition to Flash shared browser objects to administer its website and provide a more tailored and user-friendly service to you. For example, we may use cookies or Flash objects to count the number of unique computers accessing our website. You can set your browser to refuse cookies from the DCatalog service if you choose. When you access the DCatalog service or open one of our HTML emails, we may automatically record certain information from your system by using different types of tracking technology. This “automatically collected” information may include IP Address, a unique device or user ID, version of software installed, system type, the content and pages that you access on the DCatalog service, and the dates and times that you visit the DCatalog service.

### DCatalog Uses of Information:

The information we collect about you in the course of our relationship is used to provide the DCatalog service to you. For example, as we endeavor to protect your identity, we may use your demographic information to create a database of user profiles, select advertisements based on your information and for marketing analysis. In addition, we look at technical information to diagnose problems with our systems, to administer the DCatalog service, and to enhance the services we provide to you. We may use your information to track user-generated content and users to the extent necessary to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. We will use your email address, without further consent, for administrative communications such as notifying you of major updates, for customer service purposes, to address copyright infringement or defamation issues, or to contact you regarding any content that you have posted to or downloaded from the DCatalog service.

DCatalog uses all of the information that we collect to understand the usage trends and preferences of our users, to improve the way the DCatalog service works and looks, and to create new features and functionality. DCatalog may use “automatically collected” information, “cookies”, and Flash objects to: (a) automatically update the DCatalog service; (b) remember your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you access the DCatalog service; (c) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages accessed; and (d) track your entries, submissions, participation and status in any promotions or other activities, and usage of the DCatalog service.
