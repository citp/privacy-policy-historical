## Privacy

**Your Rights under the Privacy Act** : The [Privacy Act of 1974](https://web.archive.org/privacy) protects the personal information the federal government keeps on you in “systems of records (SOR)” (information an agency controls that can be retrieved by name or some other personal identifier). The Privacy Act regulates how the government can disclose, share, provide access to, and maintain the personal information that it collects. Not all information collected online is covered by the Privacy Act.

The Act’s major provisions require agencies to:

  * publish a Privacy Act Notice in the Federal Register explaining the existence, character and uses of a new or revised SOR;
  * keep information about you accurate, relevant, timely, and complete to assure fairness in dealing with you; and
  * allow you to, upon request, access and review your information held in a SOR and request amendment of the information if you disagree with it.



Your viewing of EPA’s website does not result in the collection of any personal information that is contained in a Privacy Act System of Records as defined by the Privacy Act. [View information concerning the Privacy Act](https://web.archive.org/privacy/privacy-act-laws-policies-and-resources).

**Children’s Privacy** : Some EPA Web pages provide content to children. It is EPA policy, in compliance with the requirements of the [Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)](http://www.ftc.gov/ogc/coppa1.htm), to collect no information online about or from children under the age of 13 except when it is needed to identify a submission or to answer a question. Any such instances where information is collected on Web pages for children will be clearly marked. Unless required by law or EPA obtains parental permission in writing, the information will not be used for other purposes or shared with third parties, nor will personally identifying information be published on the EPA website. When EPA offices identify the work product of a child under thirteen on the EPA public access website, only the first name, age, and home state of the child will be stated (e.g., Mike, age 7, Kentucky) unless the parent makes a hardcopy request to have additional information posted.

**EPA and Privacy:** Please be assured that the privacy of our visitors is of utmost importance to us. We collect no personally identifiable information about you when you visit our site unless you choose to provide that information to us.

We want to inform you that, for each HTTP request (which is what your Web browser generates when you request a page or part of a page from a website) received; we collect and store only the following information, in what is called a log file:

  * the date and time
  * the originating Internet Protocol (IP) address (this address can refer to a specific computer; more frequently, commercial Internet providers use a temporary IPA which does not link to a specific computer)
  * the type of browser and operating system used (if provided by the browser)
  * the URL of the referring page (if provided by the browser)
  * the object requested
  * completion status of the request
  * pages visited



The information above is also collected by Google Analytics on behalf of EPA. Google Analytics uses first-party persistent cookies, which the government classifies as Tier 2 persistent cookies. Tier 2 persistent cookies do not collect any personally identifiable information, but only those metrics listed above. In addition, persistent cookies can identify return visitors to EPA's website by setting a small file in internet Web browsers. Unless you first opt-out (see below), the Google Analytics code used will automatically set a persistent cookie in the browser of the computer you are using to access EPA's website.

Traffic statistics for EPA's website are only reported to us anonymously and in the aggregate, and no information provided by Google Analytics is traceable to any specific individual. We use the information that we automatically collect to measure the number of visitors to the different areas of our sites, and to help us make our pages more useful to visitors. This includes analyzing Web traffic to determine the types of devices and browsers that view EPA Web pages most often and the level of demand for specific pages and topics of interest.

You can opt-out by changing the cookie settings in your browser. [See instructions on how to disable cookies in some of the most popular Web browsers](http://www.usa.gov/optout_instructions.shtml). [Google also provides an Opt-Out Browser Add-on for newer browsers](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). Opting-out will still allow you to obtain comparable information from EPA websites.

For more information about the federal government's use of persistent cookies, please refer to the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) Memo Guidance for the Online Use of Web Measurement and Customization Technologies.

**How Long is the Information Retained** : The logs for each day, with no personal information, are maintained in accordance with [Records Schedule 095](https://web.archive.org/records/policy/schedule/sched/0095.htm).

**Cookies** : Cookies are small files that Web servers place on a user's hard drive. They can serve several functions, depending upon how they are designed:

  * they allow the website to identify you as a previous visitor each time you access a site;
  * they track what information you view at a site (important to commercial sites trying to determine your buying preferences);
  * in the more advanced cases they track your movements through many websites but not the whole Web;
  * businesses use them for customer convenience to allow them to produce a list of items to buy and pay for them all at one time and to garner information about what individuals are buying at their sites;
  * advertisers use them to determine the effectiveness of their marketing and offer insights into consumer preferences and tastes by collecting data from many websites; and
  * they can be used to help a website tailor screens for each customer's preference.



EPA pages have "session cookies," to facilitate use of a particular page and to identify the number and type of pages viewed during visits to [www.epa.gov](https://web.archive.org/). Session cookies disappear when the Web user terminates a Web session and closes the browser. EPA also permits the use of persistent cookies for the collection of Web metrics; however, EPA does not collect any personally identifiable information about visitors to our Web pages (see "EPA and Privacy" above).

If you are concerned about the potential use of the information gathered from your computer by cookies, you can set your browser to prompt you before it accepts a cookie. Most Internet browsers have settings that let you identify and/or reject cookies.

**Other Information Collection and Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** : In addition to the information automatically collected by the server, EPA offices may collect other information from online visitors. Before collecting personally identifiable information through our Web pages, we will prominently disclose:

  * why EPA is collecting the information;
  * what information is to be collected;
  * the intended use of the information;
  * how it will be protected/secured;
  * who at EPA will have access to the information;
  * if it will be shared within or outside EPA, including on publicly available websites, and if shared, with whom;
  * the opportunity to consent to, or reject, the collection and/or sharing;
  * how long the information will be retained and when it will be destroyed; and
  * what other privacy risks exist and how the agency will mitigate those risks.

**How the Information is Used** : We may store **non-personally identifiable information** we collect (such as search engine queries and anonymous survey responses) indefinitely to help us better understand and meet the needs of our visitors. We may share **non-personally identifiable information** with others, including the public, in aggregated form (for instance, in a list of our most popular search engine queries), in partial or edited form (such as in a report summarizing responses to a questionnaire), or verbatim (for example, in a complete listing of survey responses).

**How e-mail is Handled** : By sending us an electronic mail message (for example, an e-mail message containing an official Freedom of Information Act request), you may be sending us personally-identifying information, such as name and address. In these cases, we may retain the information as long as necessary to respond to your request or otherwise resolve the subject matter of your e-mail. Please be aware that email is not necessarily secure from third party interception or misdirection. For your own protection you may wish to communicate sensitive information using a method other than email.

Top of Page

**Personal Information via Forms** : Some of our pages provide forms allowing visitors to submit search engine queries, questionnaires, feedback, or other information. Some of these forms may request personally identifiable information (e.g., name, address, e-mail address) for specific purposes, such as when the submitter is requesting a personal response, registering for a conference, or subscribing to a mailing list. **All information submitted by visitors is voluntary.**
