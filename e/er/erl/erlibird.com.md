### When Your Information is Shared

For products that are coming soon, we often allow you to provide an email address to get on a product's waiting list. In this scenario your email address is shared with that product's owners so that they may add you to their waiting list.

We use a third-party login system from Janrain called Engage in order to allow you to login using your credentials from various popular third party websites. As the provider of these systems, your login and social profile data is first accessed and processed by Janrain and then sent to Erli Bird.

We may provide your information to third parties in certain situations:

  * To comply with a legal request, such as a search warrant, court order, or subpoena. In such circumstances, we limit disclosure until we have a good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary, or that it meets applicable legal standards.
  * When we believe it is necessary to prevent fraud or other suspected illegal activities.
  * When we believe it is required to protect our interests, rights, reputation or property, or those of our users, members, affiliates, or partners.
  * We may provide your information in aggregate, without personally identifying you, to third parties for market research, analyzing user behavior, or for other business or marketing analysis.
  * We may provide your personal information to third party service providers to help provide the services of the Erli Bird Website. We may use third parties to provide our underlying data network, host our web servers, provide our storage, deliver our email, process our payments, or provide our marketing material or advertisements. Through the performance of these business activities, our service providers may have access to your personal information.
  * Erli Bird reserves the right to transfer your user information to a successor if interest in ownership of all or substantially all of Erli Bird were to change.
