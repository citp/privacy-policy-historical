#### Sharing Personal Information

Ergotron will not sell Personal Information collected from its internet sites to mailing list brokers without your express consent.

Ergotron may share your Personal Information with other Ergotron business units. When doing so, these other Ergotron business units will use your Personal Information in a manner consistent with the purposes for which it was originally collected (or to which you subsequently consented) and only as permitted under this Policy, any applicable Country or Web Site Privacy Statements, and all applicable privacy and data protection laws.

Ergotron may also share your Personal Information with third parties we hire to perform support services for us. These third parties are required to use the Personal Information we share with them only to perform services on our behalf and under our instructions, in particular to treat your Personal Information as strictly confidential.

If such an event occurs, we will take appropriate steps to protect your Personal Information.

#### Overseas transfers and disclosures

Some of your Personal Information may be transferred, stored, processed or used outside of the U.S.A. and/or outside of the European Union by Ergotron or by third party service providers. This may happen if other Ergotron entities or venture partners are overseas, if we outsource certain activities overseas or if transactions, information, services or products have an overseas connection.

Your Personal Information may also be disclosed to third-party service providers which may store your Personal Information in the U.S.A. and European Union, and such other countries in which those parties or their, or our, computer systems may be located from time to time, where it may be used for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

Where required by applicable privacy and data protection laws, we take steps in order to ensure any overseas transfer of Personal Information is effected in compliance with the appropriate organizational and technical means (including e.g. EU Commission’s model clauses for data transfers or European Commission’s adequacy decisions). Where such parties are located overseas, you may have rights to enforce such parties’ compliance with applicable privacy and data protection laws.
