		LeasingDesk Insurance Services is a licensee of the TRUSTe Web Privacy Seal

		reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.</p>
	<h1 class="MsoNormal">About This Notice</h1>
	<p class="MsoNormal">This website is operated by Multifamily Internet Ventures, LCC 
		(“MIV”), d/b/a LeasingDesk Insurance Services (“LDIS”).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This 
		privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies to the information that you provide 
		to LDIS via the www.eRenterPlan.com Website where this Privacy Policy appears 
		in the footer, and/or by use of other services (collectively, the “Services”) 
		that may be provided by other means or media, including as set forth below.</p>
	<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>This Privacy Policy is intended to provide you notice of 
	LDIS’s information management practices, including the types of information 
	gathered, how it is used and safeguarded, and the degree to which you may 
	control the maintenance and sharing of your information.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Your 
	use of any LDIS Service or website constitutes acceptance of this Privacy 
	Policy.
	<p></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
		<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>This Privacy Policy will be continuously assessed against new 
		technologies, business practices and our customers’ needs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You 
		are encouraged to review this Privacy Policy regularly as it may change at any 
		time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The effective date of this 
		Privacy Policy and any revised or changed notice may be found on this Website.</p>
	<h1 class="MsoNormal">Personal Information Collected by LDIS</h1>
	<p class="MsoNormal">In general, you can visit this website without telling LDIS 
		who you are or without revealing any information about yourself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>LDIS 
		will not collect any personal information about you by means of this website, 
		unless you have provided such personal information to LDIS voluntarily.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</span>For example, certain LDIS Services may require you to submit personal 
		information in order for those Services to function as designated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Such 
		information might include your name, your physical contact information, 
		including your address and phone number(s), your email address, and certain 
		financial information, such as your credit card, debit card or checking account 
		number(s).
		<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">If you do choose to provide us with personal information, you 
		can be assured that such information is kept in secured databases located in 
		the United States.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We may use 
		anything we know about you to help us serve you better.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We 
		may use it, and disclose it to our affiliates and others, for any purpose 
		allowed by law.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For instance, we 
		may use your information, and disclose it to others, in order to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<div class="MsoNormal">Help us evaluate your request for a product or Service;</div>
		</li><li>
			<div class="MsoNormal">Help us process claims and other transactions;</div>
		</li><li>
			<div class="MsoNormal">Confirm or correct what we know about you;</div>
		</li><li>
			<div class="MsoNormal">Help us prevent fraud, terrorism, and other crimes by 
				verifying what we know about you; and</div>
		</li><li>
			<div class="MsoNormal">Process data for LDIS.</div>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="MsoNormal">We may also collect information about your transactions and 
		experiences, with LDIS and others, such as your payment history, claims, and 
		coverage changes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When we disclose 
		information to others to perform business services for us they are required to 
		take appropriate steps to protect this information.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And, 
		they may use the information only for the purposes of performing those business 
		services.</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">Because of the financial nature of our business, websites 
		operated by LDIS are not designed to appeal to children under the age of 13.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As 
		such, LDIS does not knowingly attempt to solicit or receive any information 
		from children.</p>
	<h1 class="MsoNormal">Control and Access to Personal Information</h1>
	<p class="MsoNormal">You have control and access to the personal information you 
		provide to LDIS.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The “Update Your 
		Policy Information” area of the website allows you to view, correct, or delete, 
		information collected about you, other than your name and physical address.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>LDIS 
		may need to communicate with you regarding critical messages relating to your 
		product or Service (such as service messages, renewal notices, or legally 
		mandated notices).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition, if 
		you are required to provide LDIS with your email address, we may use it from 
		time to time to notify you of changes to this Privacy Policy, additional 
		services, confirm transactions, or to provide general information regarding 
		your policy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If you do not wish to 
		be contacted by email for non-policy related communications from LDIS, you may 
		unsubscribe using the link provided on the email you receive.</p>
	<h1 class="MsoNormal">Opt-Out</h1>
	<p class="MsoNormal">The personal information LDIS collects is not shared with 
		non-affiliated third-parties for their marketing, or promotional, use.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, 
		there is no need to “opt-out” from sharing your personal information.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</span>LDIS may disclose personal information to the following categories of 
		non-affiliated third parties with which LDIS, and its affiliated companies, 
		contract to perform certain functions or services on their behalf:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(i) 
		other financial institutions; (ii) other insurance companies; and (iii) other 
		third-parties, such as your landlord.</p>
	<h1 class="MsoNormal">Cookies</h1>
	<p class="MsoNormal">When you visit this website, we may store some information on 
		your computer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This information 
		will be in the form of a “cookie” or similar file and can help us maintain and 
		improve this website in many ways.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</span>A “cookie” is a small amount of data that is transferred to your web browser by 
		a web server and can only be read by the server that gave it to you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It 
		functions as your identification card, recording such things as Internet 
		address, passwords, and preferences.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It 
		cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This 
		is all done without LDIS knowing your name or other personal information.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When 
		you visit any LDIS website you are anonymous, unless you chose to identify 
		yourself to us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Some of our 
		business partners may use cookies on our site.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We 
		have no access to or control over these cookies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</span>This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by the www.eRenterPlan.com website 
		only and does not cover the use of cookies by any of our business partners.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With 
		most web browsers, you can erase “cookies” from your computer hard drive, block 
		all “cookies”, or receive a warning before a “cookie” is stored.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Please 
		refer to the “Help” portion of the browser toolbar to learn more about these 
		functions.</p>
	<h1 class="MsoNormal">Information Retention</h1>

		limited to, processing credit or debit card payments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, 
		please note that LDIS may disclose personal information when required by law or 
		in the good faith belief that such action is necessary in order to comply with 
		the law or legal process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This 
		includes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;

			<div class="MsoNormal">LDIS transfers information about you if LDIS is acquired by
