# eRenterPlan - Insurance For Apartment Residents

Since 2000 LeasingDesk Insurance Services (“ LeasingDesk”) has been a trusted provider of insurance products and services to apartment renters.  Because of our valued customer relationships, LeasingDesk has in place a privacy policy that limits the disclosure of your information. The purpose of this material is to explain how LeasingDesk protects and uses information about you when and after you obtain insurance through us. We want you to know that information given to us is safe, secure and used in a responsible manner.

Information about you is safeguarded in a number of ways. We use advanced data-encryption and storage technology to protect personal information about you. We also employ a variety of physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in areas containing nonpublic personal information and maintain on-site supervision of these areas. Some of the measures taken to ensure the security of information about you include: 

  * Secure facilities with access controls at public points of entry, as well as the use of security systems. 

  * Contractually requiring business partners to safeguard and prevent the unauthorized use of personal information about our customers. 

  * Auditing company security practices. 


 

In order to issue and service your insurance policies, comply with government regulations, improve our products and services and better understand your insurance needs, we may collect and maintain nonpublic personal information about you: 

  *  

From applications or other forms (such as name, address, age, telephone number, employer, Social Security number, credit card information, and beneficiaries) 

  * From your transactions with us or others (such as name, address and telephone number) 




We may disclose information we receive from you on applications and other forms or from your transactions with others (such as name, address and telephone number) with companies that perform services on our behalf. 

LeasingDesk may also share certain personal information with the insurance company with which your insurance is placed.  We may also provide confirmation of policy issuance and/or canceallation to your sponsoring apartment community's management personnel. However, LeasingDesk will not give information to another nonaffiliated party for the purpose of soliciting you. Because of our privacy practices, we do not disclose information about our customers or former customers other than as described above or as required or permitted by law.

For each visitor to LeasingDesk websites (including LeasingDesk.com and eRenterPlan.com), our web server automatically recognizes the consumer's domain name, but not the e-mail address, and tracks the pages of our site that are visited. The generalized information we gather enables us to serve you better by continually improving our site based on current use patterns. Nonpublic personal information required as part of an electronic application process is transmitted over a secure connection. 

The policies and practices described in this notice are subject to change, but we will communicate any significant changes to you as required by law. We will also post such changes and update the revision date in this document, so that you will always know what information we collect and how to use it. The policies and procedures described in this disclosure replace all previous notices or statements regarding this subject. 

We understand the importance of your nonpublic personal information and treat it accordingly, and invite you to contact us toll free at 1-888-205-8118 if you have any additional questions.

We are committed to maintaining accurate and up-to-date information on all of our customers. We provide access to account information in lots of different ways — over the phone, through customer statements, and through other communications about your insurance. If you believe that any of your information is incorrect, please notify us immediately using the customer service number provided on your insurance documents that you received. We will respond in a timely manner to customers' requests to correct account or transaction information. However, in order to protect the confidentiality of your information, we may ask you to verify your identity and to provide other details to respond to your request.
