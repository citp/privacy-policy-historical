				<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">We have 
				created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm 
				and continuing commitment to the privacy of personal information

				We hold the privacy of your personal information in the highest

				<p><b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">We

				and our policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we 
				collect, use and safeguard the personal information you provide

				<p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">
				What Information Do We Collect?</span></strong><b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"><br>
				</span></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">
				When you visit this web site you may provide us with two types 
				of information: personal information you knowingly choose to 
				disclose that is collected on an individual basis and Web site 
				use information collected on an aggregate basis as you and 
				others browse our Web site. </span></p>
				<p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">1. 
				Personal Information You Choose to Provide </span></strong></p>
				<p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">
				Registration Information</span></strong><br>
				<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">When you 
				register for any of our products, services or newsletters you 
				will provide us information about yourself. </span></p>
				<p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">
				Credit Card Information</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"><br>
				If you choose to use our services, you may need to give 
				personal information and authorization to obtain information 
				from various credit services. For example, you may need to 
				provide the following information:<br>
				-Name<br>
				-Mailing address<br>

				If you choose to correspond with us through email, we may retain 
				the content of your email messages together with your email 
				address and our responses. We provide the same protections for 
				these electronic communications that we employ in the 
				maintenance of information received by mail and telephone.
				</span></p>
				<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"><br>
				<strong>2. Web Site Use Information</strong><br>
				Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web site utilizes a 
				standard technology called "cookies" (see explanation below, 
				"What Are Cookies?") and web server log files to collect 
				information about how our Web site is used. Information gathered 
				through cookies and Web server logs may include the date and 
				time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Web site, 
				and the Web sites visited just before and just after our Web 
				site. </span></p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">How 
				Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us? </span>
				</strong></p>
				<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Broadly 
				speaking, we use personal information for purposes of 
				administering our business activities, providing the products 
				and services you requested, to process your payment, to monitor 
				the use of the service, our marketing and promotional efforts 
				and improve our content and service offerings, and customize our 
				site's content, layout, services and for other lawful purposes. 
				These uses improve our site and better tailor it to meet your 
				needs. </span></p>
				<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">
				Furthermore, such information may be shared with others on an 
				aggregate basis. Personally identifiable information or business 
				information will not be shared with parties except as required 
				by law. </span></p>
				<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">
				Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to 
				notify you about important changes to our Website, new services, 
				and special offers we think you will find valuable. You may 
				notify us at any time if you do not wish to receive these offers 
				by emailing us at the link provided on the newsletter. <br>
				<br>
&nbsp;</span></p>
				<p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">
				What Are Cookies?</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"><br>
				A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an 
				anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, that 
				site's computer asks your computer for permission to store this 
				file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for 
				cookies. Each Web site can send its own cookie to your browser 
				if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your 
				privacy) your browser only permits a Web site to access the 
				cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you 
				by other sites. Browsers are usually set to accept cookies. 
				However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you may 
				alter the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If 
				you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, it is possible 
				that some areas of our site will not function as effectively 
				when viewed by the users. </span><b>
				<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">A cookie 
				cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive or pass on 
				computer viruses. </span></b></p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">How 
				Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"><br>
				As you visit and browse our Web site, the site uses cookies to 
				differentiate you from other users. In some cases, we also use 
				cookies to prevent you from having to log in more than is 
				necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with our Web 
				server's log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number 
				of people visiting our Web site and which parts of the site are 
				most popular. This helps us gather feedback to constantly 
				improve our Web site and better serve our clients. Cookies do 
				not allow us to gather any personal information about you and we 
				do not intentionally store any personal information that your 
				browser provided to us in your cookies. </span></p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">IP 
				Addresses</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"><br>
				IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are 
				connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is 
				used by computers on the network to identify your computer. IP 
				addresses are automatically collected by our web server as part 
				of demographic and profile data known as traffic data so that 
				data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to you.
				</span></p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">
				Sharing and Selling Information</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"><br>
				We <b>do not</b> share, sell, lend or lease any of the 
				information that uniquely identify a subscriber (such as email 
				addresses or personal details) with anyone except to the extent 
				it is necessary to process transactions or provide services that 
				you have requested. </span></p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">How 
				Can You Access and Correct Your Information?</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"><br>
				You may request access to all your personally identifiable 
				information that we collect online and maintain in our database 
				by emailing us at the usual address. </span></p>
				<p><b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">What 
				About Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information?<br>
				</span></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">We 
				may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in 
				other words, when we, in good faith, believe that the law 
				requires it or for the protection of our legal rights. We may 
				also disclose account information when we have reason to believe 
				that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, 
				contact or bring legal action against someone who may be 
				violating our Terms of Service or to protect the safety of our 
				users and the Public. </span></p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">
				What About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site?</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"><br>
				We are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites 
				linked to or from our Web site or the information or content 
				contained therein. Often links to other Web sites are provided 
				solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful 
				to the users of our Web site. <br>

				<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Please 
				remember that when you use a link to go from our Website to 
				another web site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. 
				Your browsing and interaction on any other web site, including 
				web sites, which have a link on our Website, is subject to that 
				Web site's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules 
				and policies before proceeding. </span></p>

				Your Consent</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"><br>

				your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. 
				We reserve the right to amend this privacy policy at any time

				winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for
