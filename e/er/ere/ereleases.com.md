## Federal Regulations and Full Disclosure about Testimonials

The FTC (Federal Trade Commission) has introduced new rules about the use of testimonials. 

You can no longer quote the happiest and most successful testimonials without disclosing the outcome of the "average" customer. 

When I receive emails or feedback with glowing success stories I use them on my website. I have also received many video testimonials as well. 

When I receive complaints and negative feedback, which is usually three or four a month out of 600+ orders, I do not post them on our website. 

In some instances, I have held contests for customers to share their greatest results. They submit their progress and media pickup, and we award prizes and exposure for those who achieved great results. It's interesting how some clients will work harder to win a gift card or free press release than they will to just focus on PR on their own. It's an underhanded way to get some clients to succeed by creating and following a PR campaign of multiple releases. 

I have never received enough results from surveys to determine with statistical relevance what my customers' average media coverage is; I do not know what the "average result" is. But I can give you some darn good estimates: 

-The bottom 40% of my customers do ONE RELEASE. They issue one release and scratch press releases off their marketing list. They do not understand or care that one press release is not a PR campaign. The release was fine but it wasn't newsworthy. It didn't have the IT factor. They ignore press release ideas and suggestions by editors for their next press release. They believe the media have spoken or that we're not the answer. Perhaps they will continue to waste time and energy on the free or low cost press release websites that neither reach actual journalists or go over a newswire of press releases. 

\- The middle 40% do little. They kick a few more tires, often issuing the same versions of the original press release, perhaps two or three times. Perhaps they pick up some pointers along the way but fail to see the big picture that fishing with the same bait gets the same results. I do believe that these people get some benefit and have moved further along the PR campaign trail. A few mentions on a local or industry specific blog or website is not unusual. However, no real media coverage here. These users craft better releases but they are not held to the newsworthy standard that gets a journalist to write a unique article. 

That, I believe, is what the AVERAGE customer gets. 

\- Which brings us to the top 20%. This is the group of people who really learn. They take the newsworthy ideas our editors provide and try to spin PR gold. They recognize that a PR campaign is a series of 6-8 press releases. When 1, 2 or even 3 releases fail to get traction, they stay the course. They cast a line and if the media bites, they try to figure out similar yet different approaches. They know the value of a press release newswire as they are consistently getting results through eReleases. You would assume most of these clients have us write the press release but most write the releases themselves. They get that the secret sauce is trying to determine what a subscriber of a particular newspaper, magazine, or trade publication wants to read, then give it to them. Rather than looking to blame every failure, they leapfrog to the next opportunity and angle to test. 

You can also get pretty granular: 

-10% make it a habit. They don't just do this a few times, they do it every few weeks and over a period of several months begin to see actual media pickup. They divide their PR campaign into narrow newsworthy hooks; they separate some releases into those of a general nature and those of a specific (often industry) niche. They experience the ROI of PR that alludes so many who have tried PR and moved on. They know that PR WORKS and they consistently work to get lightning to strike more than once, which it does. 

-5% are truly students of the process. They do all of the above but in addition they truly attempt to get "inside the mind of the journalist." They develop different press releases for different product offerings; they split test press release ideas; and they build systems for idea generation. They work to become an industry expert who the media calls when there's major news within their industry. These customers issue dozens of press releases and consistently get media attention. These are the people who send me quite a few testimonials. 

-2% make it and obsession. They figure out how to write copy that speaks to journalists while highlighting an idea in the most newsworthy way. They figure out how to analyze trends and try to make the news rather than piggyback off of it. These customers conduct industry surveys and publish the results, generating a lot of media attention. They conduct market research (it's not rocket science but most people just never get around to doing it) and they dominate their industry. They avail themselves of every PR opportunity and they have the attitude that they only need to get media coverage in one or two major publications at a time to pay for itself several times over.These are the people who send me LOTS of testimonials. 

(More disclosure: just because you're a top 10% or top 5% or top 2% or 1% implementor does NOT guarantee success. Being the best requires trial and failure. My most successful clients fail perhaps TWO THIRDS of the time. Wrong hook, wrong timing, wrong targets, the reasons are endless. But they look at failures as TESTING and keep going. They learn to not take failures personally. They succeed. 

-1% Embrace total mastery. They want to BE THE BEST and the most well-respected. They are not just respected in their industry, they are revered. They KNOW the industry and their end users better than the end users know themselves. These are the customers I lose but love to lose. They become such a hot source for news and quotes within a particular industry, they wake up to voice mails from journalists trying to get a quote on a particular merger, regulation, etc. They no longer need to issue press releases. All roads lead to them.   
This top 1% is committed to their expertise, continuing to devote time to education, analyzing trends, rumors and forecasts – during plateaus and during times of great prosperity. Either way, they learn with diligence and continue to become more and more valuable within an industry. This is not an easy road and that's fine. I cannot afford to lose lots of customers to this path. :) 

While I don't guarantee success, I promise to deliver the best know-how I can combined with the best press release writing and distribution service in the industry. I cannot recall the last client who did 8 press releases with no actual media coverage. I can point you to many dozens who did 8 press releases and received a fair amount of media coverage. 

If you are open to failing your way to success by learning from those failures, you will go far with PR. 

Most of my customers are not successful. My service doesn't work for everyone. However, it generally works over time with continued effort and refining. Most people don't bother to do either (putting in the effort of a series of releases over time and continually improving the ideas/hooks they try). So the average customer looks at PR and says, "Meh," there are a minority who do quite well at a minimal cost. They are not average. They are exceptional. 

If any of this doesn't feel right with you, please go elsewhere. I don't need to strong arm anyone or try to convince those who are tire kickers at heart chasing one marketing shiny object after another. 

To your success, 

Mickie Kennedy
