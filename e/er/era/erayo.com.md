(the "Registration Process"). "Personal Information” means individually identifiable  
information such as the name, telephone number, email address, financial information

Erayo may use the Personal Information in order to: 

(a) Provide certain services.

information which is available to Erayo while Erayo Members are connected to the   
Website or the System. Non-Personal Information may contain the identity of an Erayo   
Member's browsing system and operating system, the order of the pages Erayo Members

following cases: (a) an Erayo Member gave his explicit consent for such transfer prior to  
the transfer; (b) sharing and transferring Personal Information is required in order to

Buyer Terms of Use) and/or to provide other services requested by the relevant Erayo   
Member; or (c) the transfer of information is required by law or by a court   
order. For avoidance of doubt, Erayo may transfer Non-personal Information to   
third-parties at its own discretion.
