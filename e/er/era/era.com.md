For example, we provide the option to encrypt information you submit to us using Secure Sockets Layer technology that helps protect information during transport to our website. We periodically review our security measures to evaluate industry best practices and update accordingly. Even so, despite our reasonable efforts, no security measure is ever perfect or impenetrable.

## WHAT'S THE POLICY ON THIRD PARTY ANALYTICS AND ADVERTISING SERVICES?

We may allow others to provide audience measurement and analytics services for us, to serve advertisements on our behalf, and to track and report on the performance of those advertisements. These entities may use cookies, web beacons, SDKs, and other technologies to identify your device when you use the Service, as well as when you visit other online sites and services, and such services will be covered by the privacy policy of the respective third parties. 

We use Google Analytics to collect information about use of the Service.

## WHAT'S YOUR COOKIE POLICY?

### What are cookies?

Cookies are small data files stored in your device memory when you visit a website. Cookies and similar technologies are widely used by websites to make them work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the website operator about how users are using their website. 

### How does the Service use cookies?

We use cookies to improve the Service and your experience, for example to enable you to move easily between the pages of our the Service websites. We also use cookies for analytics purposes, to see which areas and features of our the Service are popular, and to count visits. Additionally, we may use 'web beacons', which are electronic images that may be used on the Service, including in our emails to help deliver cookies, count visits, and understand usage and campaign effectiveness. 

_Essential cookies_ are essential, as they enable you to move around the Service and use its features. Without these cookies we could not, for example, authenticate your login or remember that you are logged-in as you move through the Service. 

_Functionality cookies_ allow us to remember choices you make (such as the region you're in) and tailor the Service to provide enhanced features and content for you. For instance, they can be used to remember your login details or remember your nickname when you next login. They may also be used to provide services you've requested, for example leaving a comment on the Service. 

_Analytics & performances cookies_ collect information about how the Service is used, for example which pages users visit most often and if any error messages are displayed on certain pages. Information collected using these cookies is used to monitor activity on the Service and understand how it is being used. 

### How to change your cookie settings.

Most devices allow you to block cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser. However, if you use your browser settings to block cookies (including essential cookies, such as those allowing you to log-in) you may not be able to access all or parts of our the Service. 

To find out more about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them, please refer to your browser 'help' section, or visit www.aboutcookies.org or www.allaboutcookies.org. 

### Cookies that have been set in the past.

If you have disabled one or more cookies, we may still use information collected from cookies before your disabled preference was set. However, we will stop using the disabled cookie to collect any further information. 

### Controlling website tracking tools.

Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies. How you do so, however, depends on your browser and the type of cookie. Certain browsers can be set to reject all browser cookies. If you configure your computer to block all cookies, you may disrupt certain web page features, and limit the functionality we can provide when you visit or use the Service. (e.g., we will not be able to provide you with searches that you have asked us to save). You can change your cookie settings at any time. Some browsers have a “ **Do Not Track** ” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These browser features are still not uniform, so we are not currently set up to respond to those signals. 

## YOUR RIGHTS AND CHOICES

You are not required to provide all Personal Information identified in this Privacy Statement to use the Service, but certain aspects of the Service will not be available to you. However, you can use our services without consenting to non-essential cookies or direct marketing emails; the only consequence is that our products and services will be less communicated, we may not be able to provide the support you seek, and you may miss out on attractive promotions and news about our products and services. Note that in certain cases, your Personal Information will be necessary for us, or an affiliated third party, to comply with legal obligations, or enter into and perform a contract with you. 

If you reside in Europe, local data protection law may afford you the right to: obtain confirmation of the existence of certain information relating to you, to verify its content, origin, and accuracy, as well as the right to access, review, obtain a copy, port, delete, or to block or withdraw consent to the processing of certain information (without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal), by contacting us as detailed below. You may also have the right to file a complaint with an applicable supervisory authority regarding our processing of your Personal Information. 

### Deactivation.

You can deactivate your account at any time by contacting us at the email address at the bottom of this page. However, you will not be able to access many of the services to deactivate your account. Please note that even if you request deactivation of your account, it may take some time to fulfill this request. 

### Promotional communications.

You may opt out of receiving promotional messages from us by following the instructions in those messages. If you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account, about services you have requested, and our ongoing business relationship. 

### Cookies and similar technologies.

Please review your browser or device settings for certain cookies and see above to exercise certain choices regarding cookies. 

### Non-US Privacy Rights

Europe and certain other non-US jurisdictions maintain local data protection regulations that confer certain data protection rights on individuals. We will address those rights where required by applicable laws. Note that if you are a franchisee or an employee of a franchisee, and we obtain access or otherwise process your Personal Information in that context, you should contact your employer/franchisee which will be in the best position to respond to your inquiry. If applicable, and you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us as set out below. 

  1. **Right of access:** You have the right to obtain from us confirmation as to whether Personal Information concerning you is processed, and, to request access to the Personal Information. The access information includes, among other things, the purposes of the processing, the categories of Personal Information concerned, and the recipients or categories of recipient to whom the Personal Information have been or will be disclosed. This is not, however, an absolute right, and the interests of other individuals may restrict your right of access. You may have the right to obtain a copy of their Personal Information undergoing processing. 
  2. **Right to rectification:** You have the right to obtain from us the rectification of inaccurate Personal Information about you. Depending on the purposes of the processing, you may have the right to have incomplete Personal Information completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement. 
  3. **Right to erasure (right to be forgotten):** Under certain circumstances, you have the right to obtain from us the erasure of Personal Information concerning you, and we may be obligated to erase that Personal Information. 
  4. **Right to restriction of processing:** Under certain circumstances, you have the right to obtain from us restriction of processing your Personal Information. In that case, your data will be marked and may only be processed by us for certain limited purposes. As we process and use your Personal Information primarily for purposes of carrying out the contract for a services relationship with your employer, we will have a legitimate interest for the processing which will override your restriction request, unless the restriction request relates to marketing activities. 
  5. **Right to data portability:** Under certain circumstances, you have the right to receive the Personal Information about you, which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and you have the right to transmit that data to another entity without hindrance from us. 
  6. **Right to object:** Under certain circumstances, you have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to the processing of your Personal Information by us, and we can be required to no longer process your Personal Information. 



Where permitted by applicable law, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with a competent data protection supervisory authority.
