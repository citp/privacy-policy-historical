## The LA Names Privacy Policy

We understand that making purchases online involves a great deal of trust on your part; we take this trust very seriously, and make it our highest priority to ensure the security and confidentiality of the personally identifiable information ("PII") you provide us. (PII includes information that can be linked to a specific individual, such as name, address, phone number, or e-mail address).

As a visitor to LA Names' web sites, www.la and www.register.la ("LA Names"), you have the right to understand our information privacy practices prior to providing LA Names with any of your PII.

### What information we collect

LA Names only collects PII that you provide to us by email, telephone or online form.

Contact Information:
    We are required by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN"), the organization which assumes responsibility for domain name allocation, and LANIC the registry administrator of .la to collect certain information about you during the domain name registration process. This information includes your full name, mailing address, phone number, email address, and, where provided, your fax number. Such contact information may be used, for example, to communicate with you when necessary with respect to transactions conducted through our websites. Additionally, we may collect contact information provided to us during any correspondence relating to customer support we supply to you, as well as in connection with products and services offered on our website.
Financial Information:
    We also collect and retain certain financial information from you during the domain name registration process, as well as in connection with other products and services which we offer you. For example, when you apply to register a domain name or sign up for any other product or service at LA Names, we require you to provide a credit card number and billing address before we will process that application. We will not sell, share or rent any financial information collected from you except as disclosed in this policy or as necessary to fulfill your order which is processed by our third party service providers CentralNic.
Demographic Information:
    We may collect and store anonymous demographic information (such as your zip code, gender and age), and use this data to tailor your experience at LA Names, provide content that we think you might be interested in, and display the content according to your preferences. Such demographic information may be shared with partners, market researchers and other third parties on an aggregate, non-personally identifiable basis. No personally identifiable information will be linked to aggregated demographic information.
Internet Protocol Address:
    We collect and retain an IP address from all visitors to LA Names. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Site and for purposes of traffic analysis within the website, and to help prevent fraud. No personally identifiable information will be linked to such information.
Other Information:
    We collect and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, our servers track the type of Web browser you are using, and the page to which you link from LA Names. We collect this information to better develop a sense of what services our customers need, but not to track your individual usage patterns, except within our website. We may use such information for marketing purposes, and to send information to you which we believe might be of interest. In addition, such information may be shared with partners, market researchers and other third parties on an aggregate, non-personally identifiable basis. No personally identifiable information will be linked to such aggregated information shared with third parties.

In addition, we may obtain non-sensitive contact information from third parties, including via bulk access licenses from other registrars.
