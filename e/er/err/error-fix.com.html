  <p>Error-Fix.com is committed to protecting the privacy of  personal information you may provide to us when using any of our online  services. These services can include this website, any other web properties that link to this site. These are referred to as the websites. This Privacy Policy describes how we treat information we receive when you transmit data to Error-Fix.com.</p>
  <h2>Information Collection</h2>
  <p>When you  purchase, download trial or evaluation versions, or register the  software, we may collect personal information including your name, address, email address, etc. for the purpose of recording the transaction when you engage  in activities on the websites or within the  software. When we use a  payment processing merchant we ensure that the same strict privacy criteria are  in place. We do not (knowingly) collect personal information from persons under  the age of eighteen. We also give users the option of receiving useful product  information (such as updates, pest alerts and associated product offerings),  via opt-in permission based email. We fully ensure your privacy and value your  trust. We will never sell, rent, lease or trade your personal information to  any third party. Likewise, your information will not be shared with a third  party in any other way unless Error-Fix.com is required to do so by law. Error-Fix.com may engage the services of a third party from time to time and may  provide certain information that includes personal information in order for the third party to perform such services. Any third parties who provide services to Error-Fix.com have agreed not to disclose your information or use it for any other purpose, and are required to implement or adopt a Privacy Policy that is  no less stringent than Error-Fix.com's Privacy Policy. You may opt out of receiving emails from us at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link in the  email. By choosing to enter and submit the requested information when prompted,  you are consenting to Error-Fix.com's collection, use, and disclosure of such  information for the purposes as outlined herein.</p>
  <p> Any information that you post to a chat room, public bulletin or forum is available  to all users of that site. Error-Fix.com cannot control, nor is it responsible  for the use, disclosure, or dissemination of such information by any third  parties.</p>
  <h2>Website Usage</h2>
  <p> We may automatically collect IP addresses and website usage information when you  access our online services. This information helps us evaluate how our visitors  navigate our sites on an aggregate basis, including but not limited to the  number and frequency of visitors, length of visits, etc.</p>
  <h2>How Information Is Used When Collected</h2>

  <h2> Cookies</h2>
  <p> We define  a cookie as any string of data and information that is automatically stored on  your computer upon access to our services. Error-Fix.com employs cookies to  assign temporary identification numbers to machines that access our services.  This information enables us to deliver faster service capabilities to our  customers or to our affiliates and/or other sales partners, prevent denial of  service attacks on our systems, detect and prevent fraudulent transactions, and  assist with awarding proper sales credit to our partners. All Error-Fix.com  cookies are 1) of limited duration, 2) less than 5KB in length, 3) only visible  to Error-Fix.com, and 4) devoid of any personally identifiable information.

  <h2> Links</h2>
  <p>We may  offer links from the websites to other third-party websites which may be hosted  by our co-branding partners or by unrelated companies which we think may be of  interest to you. Such websites are not governed by this privacy policy and  Error-Fix.com makes no representation as to their practices for dealing with your  personal information. We recommend that you check the privacy policy of any  website at the beginning of your visit.</p>
