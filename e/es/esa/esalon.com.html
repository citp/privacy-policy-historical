          <h6>Information Collection and Use</h6>
<p>eSalon.com, a Delaware Limited Liability Corporation ("eSalon" or "we") operates the site <a href="http://www.eSalon.com">www.eSalon.com</a> ("Site"). eSalon collects personal and other information from you in order to enable you to purchase products on the Site that are customized to meet your hair needs.  eSalon will not sell, share, or rent any information to any third party, except as indicated in this privacy policy.  The information that we collect (unless we indicate that we don't store it) is stored on our dedicated servers, whether located at eSalon or at a secure offsite facility.  </p>

<h6>Information We Collect</h6>
<p>We collect information such as personal appearance, hair characteristics, and hair-dying habits from our clients in order to formulate custom hair care products. We also collect information about you in order to better serve you and facilitate your purchases and shopping experience. Such information may include your name, shipping address, billing address, telephone numbers, e-mail address, and your credit card and other payment information ("personal information"). We may also collect data we gather from your use of the Site, the pages you visit and the options you select, as well as the IP address you use to access the Site.  Much of this data, called analytics, is collected in the aggregate in anonymized fashion to optimize the operation of the Site.</p>
<p>
You will be given the opportunity to establish an online account, and to create your unique login password.  In order to protect your account and your personal information, you should not share your login information with anyone.  We also do not share this information with third parties. </p>

<h6>Sharing Information</h6>
<p>eSalon will use the services of third parties for certain purposes.  These purposes may include credit card processing, order fulfillment, package delivery, marketing assistance, postal and e-mail delivery, customer service, and data analysis. The third parties we contract with for these purposes have limited access to your personal information and may not use it for other purposes or transfer it.</p>

<p>eSalon does not store your credit card information.  In order to process credit card payments, eSalon uses the service of secure payment processors/gateways such as Authorize.Net, and the credit card information you provide goes directly to such a processor (where it is subject to their privacy policy) and is encrypted and transmitted via such gateways to financial institutions for authorization and approval. For your own protection and ours, we may also use the fraud screening services of third party companies. When your data or information is in the possession of such third parties/sites, your data and information are subject to such third party privacy policies, not this Privacy Policy.  </p>

<p>eSalon does not sell, rent or transfer your personal information, except as otherwise indicated herein.</p>

<p>eSalon may also share your personal information as necessary to comply with court orders, legal processes, judicial proceedings and as requested by law agencies and as necessary to protect our rights.</p>

<p>In connection with any sale of eSalon or any line of business (including the assets relating thereto), client information generally is one of the transferred business assets, and such client information (including your personal information) will be transferred or sold to the acquirer in the event of any such sale or disposition.</p>

<p>We will not display your personal information on the Site unless you choose to display it. If you post any content on the Site (such as comments or other text, testimonials, photos or videos), you can associate any "display name" you choose with your content or activity, as long as it is available. We recommend that you choose a user name that protects your own privacy online.</p>

<h6>Partnerships and External Sources</h6>
<p>The Site may link to external sites beyond our control. eSalon is not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties. eSalon recommends that you review the privacy policies of the sites you visit when you leave our Site. This privacy policy covers only the way eSalon treats the information it collects on its own Site. </p>

<p>In some cases our Site may frame, mask or include components of third parties within our interface where it may seem that you are only browsing our Site. In such cases, eSalon will review the privacy practices of such sites, and will include such components or webpages only after determining that such sites maintain a comparable commitment to privacy as eSalon.</p>

<h6>Cookies</h6>
<p>Cookies are bits of text or identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser to enable our system to recognize your browser and to facilitate your shopping experience.  For example, because we use cookies, if you return to the Site to reorder products, you may not have to answer questions that you answered on prior visits (e.g., your preferred shipping address).  The Help function on the toolbar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable cookies altogether. However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of eSalon's most important features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, each shopping experience on the Site may feel like the first time you made a purchase on the Site and entered all of the information we required.  </p>

<p>There may be cookies on our Site placed by our business partners and we have no access or control over these cookies. This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by eSalon only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties.</p>

<h6>Security</h6>
<p>eSalon uses commercially reasonable efforts to protect the security of your personal information.  In order to assure you that the webpages where you provide personal information are trustworthy and secure, such transmission of information will be encrypted and the webpages where such information is collected, such as your account pages, will be SSL certified by a reputable Internet certification organization such as GeoTrust. </p> 

<h6>Notices</h6>
<p>At the time of your order, you may opt-in to receive optional notifications from eSalon. Optional notices are sent via e-mail and include an opt-out link if you no longer wish to receive them. You may also log into your account and indicate that you no longer wish to receive optional notices. </p>

<h6>Changes and Notifications</h6>
<p>We reserve the right to make modifications to this Privacy Policy. Changes would become effective 48 hours from the time the modifications are announced on the Site. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our homepage.  Your continued use of the Site after such modifications are announced on the Site constitutes your acceptance of such modifications.</p>

<h6>Governing Law</h6>
<p>eSalon is based in California, and our servers are also US-based.  You agree that your use of our Site is governed by the laws applicable in the State of California.  While we accept orders from outside of the United States, and we treat your personal information with great care, we do not purport to comply with all privacy policies in other jurisdictions.</p>
