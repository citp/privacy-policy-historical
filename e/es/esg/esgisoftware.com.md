ESGI IMPLEMENTS REASONABLE SECURITY MEASURES TO PROTECT THE SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION BOTH ONLINE AND OFFLINE, AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO THE PROTECTION OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION.

Federal law (The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) 20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99) allows a school educational institution to release student records to an organization that is "conducting studies for, or on behalf of, educational agencies or institutions for the purpose of developing, validating, or administering predictive tests... [or] improving instruction." However, FERPA requires limitations on disclosure of those records and implementation of appropriate security measures to protect those records. To help your school educational institution comply with FERPA, ESGI has adopted certain practices, and requires that educators using this site fulfill certain responsibilities to safeguard student data. The following statement explains our practices and your responsibilities regarding the student data you enter on this site.

FOR USER ACCOUNTS REGISTERED DIRECTLY WITH ESGI APPLICATIONS, PROFILE INFORMATION IS PROTECTED BY THE USERNAME AND PASSWORD OF EACH MEMBER ACCESSING THEIR ONLINE ACCOUNT. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU PROTECT AND MAINTAIN THE SECURITY OF YOUR ACCOUNT AND THAT YOU IMMEDIATELY NOTIFY US OF ANY UNAUTHORIZED USE OF YOUR ACCOUNT. IF YOU FORGET THE PASSWORD TO YOUR ESGI ACCOUNT, THE WEBSITE ALLOWS YOU TO REQUEST PASSWORD RESETS USING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION SUCH AS EMAIL or USERNAME. WHEN YOU SIGN INTO YOUR ACCOUNT OR ENTER PAYMENT INFORMATION (SUCH AS A CREDIT CARD NUMBER), WE ENCRYPT THE TRANSMISSION OF THAT INFORMATION USING SECURE SOCKET LAYER TECHNOLOGY ("SSL").

WHILE WE TAKE REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS AGAINST POSSIBLE SECURITY BREACHES OF OUR WEBSITES AND OUR CUSTOMER DATABASES AND RECORDS, NO WEBSITE OR INTERNET TRANSMISSION IS COMPLETELY SECURE, AND WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, HACKING, DATA LOSS, OR OTHER BREACHES WILL NEVER OCCUR. Should a breach occur, ESGI will contact the appropriate TEACHER, SCHOOL, DISTRICT OR EDUCATIONAL ENTITY related to the breach and work with the district to contact the parents of students affected by the breach.

WE URGE YOU TO TAKE STEPS TO KEEP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION SAFE (INCLUDING YOUR ACCOUNT PASSWORD), AND TO LOG OUT OF YOUR ACCOUNT AFTER USE. IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SECURITY OF OUR WEBSITES, PLEASE CONTACT US AT SAM@ESGISOFTWARE.COM.

BECAUSE WE VALUE YOUR PRIVACY WE HAVE TAKEN THE NECESSARY PRECAUTIONS TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE CALIFORNIA ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT. WE THEREFORE WILL NOT DISTRIBUTE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO OUTSIDE PARTIES WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT.  AS PART OF THE CALIFORNIA ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT, ALL USERS OF OUR SITE MAY MAKE ANY CHANGES TO THEIR INFORMATION AT ANYTIME BY LOGGING INTO THE [HTTP://WWW.ESGISOFTWARE.COM](https://web.archive.org/) WEBSITE AND GOING TO THE 'PROFILE' PAGE.

THE FOLLOWING STATEMENTS outline our compliance with the required provisions listed in California Assembly Bill No. 1584, Education Code, Section 49073.1:    

      
  * THE pupil records that school districts or schools provide will continue to be the property of and under the control of the school district.
  * pupils may retain possession and control of their own pupil-generated content, and if applicable a pupil may transfer pupil-generated content to a personal account by contacting ESGI at support@esgisoftware.com.  

  * ESGI prohibits against using any information in the pupil record for any purpose other than those required or specifically permitted by the contract.
  * a parent, legal guardian, or eligible pupil may review personally identifiable information in the pupil's records and correct erroneous information by contacting us at support@esgisoftware.com.
  * ESI warrants that it has designated an individual responsible for training employees and agents on reasonable protection measures and the confidentiality of Pupil Records consistent with state and federal law.  OUR Security Statement located at https://support.esgisoftware.com/entries/23789132-Data-Security is aimed at being transparent about our security practices.
  * Immediately upon becoming aware of a compromise of Pupil Records, or of circumstances that could have resulted in an unauthorized access to or disclosure of Pupil Records, ESGI will notify the DISTRICT/Account holder, fully investigate the incident, and fully cooperate with the District’s investigation of the incident, implement remedial measures and respond in a timely manner with notification of the incident to the affected parent, legal guardian, or eligible pupil.
  * pupil records will not be retained or available upon completion of the terms of the contract. Upon request by the district, ESGI will provide verification in written form that pupil records have been removed from our systems. (NOTE: These requirements do not apply to pupil-generated content if the pupil chooses to establish or maintain an account with ESGI for the purpose of storing that content either by retaining possession and control of their own pupil- generated content, or by transferring pupil-generated content to a personal account).
  * FEDERAL LAW (THE FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA) 20 U.S.C. § 1232G; 34 CFR PART 99) ALLOWS A SCHOOL EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION TO RELEASE STUDENT RECORDS TO AN ORGANIZATION THAT IS "CONDUCTING STUDIES FOR, OR ON BEHALF OF, EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES OR INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PURPOSE OF DEVELOPING, VALIDATING, OR         ADMINISTERING PREDICTIVE TESTS... [OR] IMPROVING INSTRUCTION." FERPA REQUIRES LIMITATIONS ON DISCLOSURE OF THOSE RECORDS AND IMPLEMENTATION OF APPROPRIATE SECURITY MEASURES TO PROTECT THOSE RECORDS. ESGI is familiar with the confidentiality, security and disclosure requirements of FERPA, its implementing regulations and Pupil privacy and confidentiality requirements of California law, including but not           limited to California Education Code section 49060 et seq. and have designated an individual responsible for ensuring compliance therewith.  ESGI will abide by the disclosure, security, breach notification retention/destruction and use provisions as required by law. ESGI will only use student data at the direction of the school or district, and in accordance with FERPA and the terms of their contract or written agreement. ESGI will not disclose Pupil Records to any third party.
  * ESGI PROHIBITS THE USE OF personally identifiable information in pupil records to engage in targeted advertising.



WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO MODIFY THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT AT ANY TIME, SO PLEASE REVIEW IT FREQUENTLY. IF WE DECIDE TO CHANGE OUR PRIVACY POLICY, WE WILL POST THOSE CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT, THE HOMEPAGE, AND OTHER PLACES WE DEEM APPROPRIATE SO THAT YOU ARE AWARE OF WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT, HOW WE USE IT, AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES, IF ANY, WE DISCLOSE IT.
