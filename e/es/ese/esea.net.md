This Policy applies to all websites, servers and services owned or provided by ESEA (collectively, "ESEA Sites"). ESEA may add new sites, domain names or services from time to time. As explained below, this Policy applies only to websites owned and services maintained by ESEA and not to websites or services to which links may be provided on ESEA Sites.

ESEA Sites may provide links to independent websites for your convenience and information. If you access these links, you will leave our site. ESEA does not control these independent sites or their privacy practices, which may differ from this Policy. ESEA does not endorse or make any representations about any independent websites. The personal data you choose to provide to, or that is collected directly by, these independent sites is not covered by this Policy. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of each and every website you visit on the Internet before submitting your personal information.

We also urge parents and guardians to instruct their children never to give out their real names, addresses or phone numbers without parental permission when using the Internet.
