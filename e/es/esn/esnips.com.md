When we offer a paid (“Pro”) account, we will use personal information for billing.

  
**IP Addresses**  
IP addresses are automatically reported by your browser each time you view a web page. Your IP address is NOT stored in our user registration databases, it is only recorded while the user is visiting the site. Once you have left our site, no record of your IP address remains with us until the next time you access our site.  
IP addresses may be used for various purposes, including:   
  
  * To diagnose or service technology problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web company or ISP.

  * To estimate the total number of users visiting eSnips from specific geographical regions.

  * eSnips sets and accesses eSnips cookies on your computer. We do not access cookies set by any other site or services provider, and other sites or service providers cannot access eSnips cookies on your computer.
  * We do allow other companies (such as Google) that show advertisements on some of our pages to set and access their own cookies on your computer. This privacy policy does not govern other companies’ use of their cookies: each such company has its own privacy policy which governs its use of its own cookies.
  * You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. But If you choose to reject all cookies, or to reject the eSnips cookie when your browser notifies you of a request to set it, your use of our services will be limited as follows:

  * Users are invited to access a shared folder via email. Their email address is visible to the other users whom you have invited to access the shared folder. If the visiting users are also users of eSnips , their user name will also be visible along with the email address.
