# Essay Rater - Privacy Policy

This privacy statement is designed to help you understand how we use and safeguard the personal information you provide to us. This privacy statement describes the practices of essayrater.com.

Please note that this website provides direct links to various sponsor and marketing partner sites, where you can apply for products and services (such as student loans) or register for more information. This privacy statement does not describe the practices of our partners. Before disclosing personal information on any other company's web site, you should read the privacy policy associated with that site.

**Information That We Collect**

When you visit our Web site, you may provide us with information in different ways. For example, you may register with us or sign up for our newsletter. Or, you may complete search forms to get information from us about things like colleges or financial aid. Additionally, we collect information on an aggregate basis as you and others browse our web site.

The types of information we ask for varies with the search you're conducting. In addition to your name and contact information, we will ask for other information related to the topic. For example, in order to personalize your search for a college, we may ask about your high school graduation date, school performance, desired college locations, and career goals. If you request document editing services from us, you will provide a copy of the letter, essay or resume you want us to revise.

**How We Use the Information**

In general, we use the information you provide in order to:

  * respond to your requests for information  

  * provide the services you request  

  * provide customer service  

  * provide links between targeted product and service providers and appropriate individuals



For example, if you request information on financial aid, we will send you that information. If you so choose, we can also provide your information to those marketing partners who offer financial aid packages so they may send you information on their products and services.

If you request editing or resume writing services, we provide those services and bill you for the services as instructed. We do NOT sell any personal information from essays or resumes to any third parties. For example, unlike some resume services, we do not sell resume information to job posting boards. The full policy regarding use of customer information can be found in the Terms of Service that you must check to complete your order.

If you purchase a product or service on our site, you may provide us with a credit card number. This credit card number will only be used to process your purchase. We will not disclose credit card numbers to third parties for marketing purposes under any circumstances.
