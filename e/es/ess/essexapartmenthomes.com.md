**_Cookies_**

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a users’ computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this Web Site. We may link the information we store in cookies to any Personal Information you submit while on our Web Site.

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.  We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Web Site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.  You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s help file.

We set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you don’t have to enter it more than once. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.

If you reject cookies, you may still use our Web Site, but your ability to use some areas of our Web Site, such as saving properties, will be limited.

Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) may use cookies on our Web Site. We have no access to or control over these cookies.  This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by this Web Site only and does not cover the use of cookies by any business partners or advertisers on our Web Site or other Essex web sites.  See Third Party Advertisers and Links to Other Sites

**_Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)_**

We may employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our Web Site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We may tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customer’s Personal Information.  We may use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.  This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.

**_Third Party Advertisers_**

The ads appearing on this Web Site or other Essex web sites, if any, may be delivered to users by third-party advertising companies.  Third-party advertising companies may use cookies and clear GIFs on this Web Site, which allow it to recognize a user’s cookie when a user visits this site.  The companies serve their ads from their own web sites, independently from Essex.  The information that the third-party advertising companies collect and share through this technology is governed by the privacy policies of those third parties.  We encourage you to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.

**_Framing_**
