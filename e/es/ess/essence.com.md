**Essence Communications Partners**   
**  Web Site Privacy Policy**   


Essence Communications Partners's Web Site Privacy Policy has been developed as an extension of our commitment to combine the finest quality products and services with the highest level of integrity in dealing with our customers.  The Policy guides how we collect, store and use information about customers and prospects, and it will be continuously assessed against new technologies, business practices and our customers’ changing needs. 

Our Policy recognizes two kinds of personal data that deserve different levels of protection.  Personally-Identifiable Information includes, for example, e-mail addresses, billing information, employment status and “click stream” data that tracks visitor activity on a Web site or online service. A subset of that category, Sensitive Data, deserves additional safeguards.  Sensitive Data includes, by way of example, Social Security numbers, mothers’ maiden names, personal financial data (such as specific salary, portfolio or net worth information), information about specific medical conditions and most information about children.  Our business units collect Personally-Identifiable Information and Sensitive Data only when there is a legitimate business reason to do so. 

Our Policy provides the following: 

**_Notice:_**

Our Website does not automatically collect any individually identifiable information from visitors.  We collect the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail and any information volunteered by the customer, such as survey information and/or site registrations. This information is used by our editors to better understand our subscribers and by our advertisers to target their advertisements. It is not required for magazine fulfillment and should be submitted at the subscriber's discretion. 

We need to collect and store your name, address, and other basic Personally-Identifiable Information, for example, to fulfill your subscription or to provide other products or services you requested, as well as for billing purposes.  This information also enables us to develop and customize products to better meet your needs and preferences and to offer you products from Essence Communications Partners and other sources that may be of interest to you. 

From time to time, we are approached by companies and organizations that have a product or service that we believe may be of interest to you. We may share your Personally-Identifiable Information with these companies in an effort to help you find these resources. We do not expect to receive any consideration from those companies or organizations for providing this information; however, we reserve the right to do so. 

If your relationship with us includes providing us with Sensitive Data, we will protect that information with extra care. We will not distribute Sensitive Data outside of Essence Communications Partners. 

We contract with [Maxworldwide](http://www.maxworldwide.com/) to sell and manage the advertisements that you see on the site. Maxworldwide makes available both its policies and information practices.

**_Security:_**   
We will maintain appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of your Personally-Identifiable Information. 

**_Review and Correction:_**

We are continuing to enhance our procedures to enable you to review and correct, upon request, the Personally-Identifiable Information we collect from you. Currently, most of our units require that you make such a request in a manner that can be verified. 

**_Questions or comments:_**

The Essence Communications Partners, Web Site Privacy Policy has been developed out of respect for the privacy preferences and choices of our customers and prospects. We have established procedures to ensure that every reasonable effort is made to address your concerns.
