				When you visit the Essie website, like when you visit most other websites, certain anonymous information about your visit is automatically logged, which may include information about the type of browser you use, the server name and IP address through which you access the internet (such as "aol.com" or "earthlink.net"), the date and time you access the site, the pages you access while at the Essie website, and the internet address of the website, if any, from which you linked directly to the Essie site. This information is not personally identifiable.
			</p>
		</div>
		
		<h2 class="accordion_toggle">Personally Identifiable Information</h2>
		<div class="accordion_content">
			
			<p>		
				Personally Identifiable Information is any information that concerns you individually and would permit someone to contact you, for example, your name, address, telephone/fax number, social security number, email address or any information you submitted to essie.com that identifies you individually. Essie.com will not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you provide it. Therefore, if you do not want essie.com to obtain any personally identifiable information about you, do not submit it. You can visit and browse the Essie website without revealing personally identifiable information about yourself. You may also choose to disclose personally identifiable information about yourself, which may be maintained as described below. Essie.com may collect personally identifiable information about you from its website by methods such as the following:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Registration Forms - If you are offered the opportunity to enter a promotion, to become a registered user of the Essie website, or to opt-in to receive L'Oréal information through another site, you must apply by filling out the registration form on the site. This form requires certain personally identifiable information that may include, without limitation, your name, email address, postal address, telephone number, areas of interest, product usage, and/or a unique individual password. Transactions and Activity - If you become a registered user or if you conduct transactions through the Essie website, essie.com collects information about the transactions you engage in while on the website and your other activity on the site. This information may include, without limitation, areas of the website that you visit, transaction type, content that you view, download or submit, transaction amount, payment, shipping and billing information as well as the nature, quantity and price of the goods or services you exchange and the individuals or entities with whom you communicate or transact business.</li>
				<li>Email and other voluntary communications - You may also choose to communicate with essie.com through email, via our website, by telephone, in writing, or through other means. We collect the information in these communications, and such information may be personally identifiable.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		
		<h2 class="accordion_toggle">Information Use</h2>
		<div class="accordion_content">
			
			<p>

Finally, as Essie's business develops, it may sell or buy corporate assets, and in such transactions customer information may be one of the transferred business assets. If Essie, its internet businesses, or substantially all of its assets, is acquired, customer information may be one of the assets transferred.
