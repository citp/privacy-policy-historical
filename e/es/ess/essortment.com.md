# PageWise ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY

Essotment.com is owned by PageWise, Inc.  Pagewise is strongly committed to protecting your privacy and providing a safe online experience for all our users. This Privacy Policy applies to information collected online through PageWise's Web site, which includes all of the PageWise.com articles and governs online data collection and usage by PageWise. Please read the complete PageWise Online Privacy Policy below and contact us if you have any questions. 

Collection and Tracking of Personal Information   
So that we can provide you with the most efficient and enhanced service, we may request information about you. In that event we collect personally identifiable information such as names, email addresses and demographic information such as age, gender and zip code. We also may collect your IP address, browser type, domain name, access times and referring Web site address. This information is collected both during registration on a site or in response to specific requests, for example when signing up for a newsletter, entering a sweepstakes or contest or answering a survey. 

Sometimes we will give you the opportunity to opt in to offers from third parties not affiliated with PageWise. If you decide to accept these offers, we will provide, with your consent, your information to the third party. However, you should note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to information users consent to give to third parties not affiliated with PageWise. Any information users give to another party is governed by the rules of that party's privacy policy, which may differ from this Privacy Policy. PageWise is not responsible for information given to other parties. Please review their privacy policies prior to providing any information to third parties 

What Does PageWise Do With Collected Information?   
We use personal information so that we may display custom, personalized content to our visitors and send newsletters, emails, features, promotional material, surveys and other updates to our users. A user may, at any time, opt out of receiving such information. We also use collected information to evaluate and administer our service, respond to any problems that may arise and to gauge user trends to determine what part of our services are most popular with users. 

We may extend offers to users on behalf of our partners about a particular product or service that may be of interest to you, but we will never give out your name or personal information at any time without your permission. As result, although PageWise may receive a fee from our partners for this service, PageWise sends all the offers so that your personal information is never shared with any outside third party. 

We may, at times, produce reports for advertisers containing aggregate information about our users such as demographic, age and online usage information. This allows us to work more closely with advertisers to provide content and offers that are most relevant to our users. We will never include any personal information of our users in these reports. 

We reserve the right to use or disclose any information without notice or consent as needed to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request; to conduct investigations of consumer complaints or possible breaches of law; to protect the integrity of our site and our property; to protect the safety of our visitors or others; to fulfill your requests; or to cooperate in any legal investigation. 

You should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose information online (whether through PageWise's services or any other service available online), personal or otherwise, that information can be collected and used by others. For example, if you use chat, forums, bulletin boards, your e-mail or if you post personal information online, you may receive unsolicited messages from others. PageWise has no control over this use of your personal information.
