<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This privacy statement is designed to help you understand how we use and safeguard the personal information you provide to us. This privacy statement describes the practices of essayrater.com.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Please note that this website provides direct links to various sponsor and marketing partner sites, where you can apply for products and services (such as student loans) or register for more information. This privacy statement does not describe the practices of our partners. Before disclosing personal information on any other company's web site, you should read the privacy policy associated with that site.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Information That We Collect</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When you visit our Web site, you may provide us with information in different ways. For example, you may register with us or sign up for our newsletter. Or, you may complete search forms to get information from us about things like colleges or financial aid. Additionally, we collect information on an aggregate basis as you and others browse our web site.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The types of information we ask for varies with the search you're conducting. In addition to your name and contact information, we will ask for other information related to the topic. For example, in order to personalize your search for a college, we may ask about your high school graduation date, school performance, desired college locations, and career goals. If you request document editing services from us, you will provide a copy of the letter, essay or resume you want us to revise.<br>
<br></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>How We Use the Information</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In general, we use the information you provide in order to:</font></p>
<ul>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">respond to your requests for information<br></font>
</li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">provide the services you request<br></font>
</li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">provide customer service<br></font>
</li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">provide links between targeted product and service providers and appropriate individuals</font>
</li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For example, if you request information on financial aid, we will send you that information. If you so choose, we can also provide your information to those marketing partners who offer financial aid packages so they may send you information on their products and services.<br>
<br>
If you request editing or resume writing services, we provide those services and bill you for the services as instructed. We do NOT sell any personal information from essays or resumes to any third parties. For example, unlike some resume services, we do not sell resume information to job posting boards. The full policy regarding use of customer information can be found in the Terms of Service that you must check to complete your order.<br>
<br>
If you purchase a product or service on our site, you may provide us with a credit card number. This credit card number will only be used to process your purchase. We will not disclose credit card numbers to third parties for marketing purposes under any circumstances.<br>
<br></font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Cookies and Web Site Information</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>How Do We Secure Information Transmissions?</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you purchase a product from us, we will ask for a credit card number. These transactions are secured using licensed secure server software which encrypts the information you provide.<br>
