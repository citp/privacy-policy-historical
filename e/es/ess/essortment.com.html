<h1>PageWise ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY </h1>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black">Essotment.com is owned by 
PageWise, Inc.&nbsp; Pagewise is strongly committed to protecting your privacy and 
providing a safe online experience for all our users. This Privacy Policy 
applies to information collected online through PageWise's Web site, which 
includes all of the PageWise.com articles and governs online data collection and 
usage by PageWise. Please read the complete PageWise Online Privacy Policy below 
and contact us if you have any questions. </span></p>
<p><span class="cathead1"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Collection and 
Tracking of Personal Information</span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black">
<br>
So that we can provide you with the most efficient and enhanced service, we may 
request information about you. In that event we collect personally identifiable 
information such as names, email addresses and demographic information such as 
age, gender and zip code. We also may collect your IP address, browser type, 
domain name, access times and referring Web site address. This information is 
collected both during registration on a site or in response to specific 
requests, for example when signing up for a newsletter, entering a sweepstakes 
or contest or answering a survey. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black">Sometimes we will give you 
the opportunity to opt in to offers from third parties not affiliated with 
PageWise. If you decide to accept these offers, we will provide, with your 
consent, your information to the third party. However, you should note that this 
Privacy Policy does not apply to information users consent to give to third 
parties not affiliated with PageWise. Any information users give to another 
party is governed by the rules of that party's privacy policy, which may differ 
from this Privacy Policy. PageWise is not responsible for information given to 
other parties. Please review their privacy policies prior to providing any 
information to third parties </span></p>
<p><span class="cathead1"><span style="font-size: 10pt">What Does PageWise Do 
With Collected Information?</span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black">
<br>
We use personal information so that we may display custom, personalized content 
to our visitors and send newsletters, emails, features, promotional material, 
surveys and other updates to our users. A user may, at any time, opt out of 
receiving such information. We also use collected information to evaluate and 
administer our service, respond to any problems that may arise and to gauge user 
trends to determine what part of our services are most popular with users.
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black">We may extend offers to 
users on behalf of our partners about a particular product or service that may 
be of interest to you, but we will never give out your name or personal 
information at any time without your permission. As result, although PageWise 
may receive a fee from our partners for this service, PageWise sends all the 
offers so that your personal information is never shared with any outside third 
party. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black">We may, at times, produce 
reports for advertisers containing aggregate information about our users such as 
demographic, age and online usage information. This allows us to work more 
closely with advertisers to provide content and offers that are most relevant to 
our users. We will never include any personal information of our users in these 
reports. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black">We reserve the right to use 
or disclose any information without notice or consent as needed to satisfy any 
law, regulation or legal request; to conduct investigations of consumer 
complaints or possible breaches of law; to protect the integrity of our site and 
our property; to protect the safety of our visitors or others; to fulfill your 
requests; or to cooperate in any legal investigation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black">You should be aware that if 
you voluntarily disclose information online (whether through PageWise's services 
or any other service available online), personal or otherwise, that information 
can be collected and used by others. For example, if you use chat, forums, 
bulletin boards, your e-mail or if you post personal information online, you may 
receive unsolicited messages from others. PageWise has no control over this use 
of your personal information. </span></p>

according to your preferences. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies 
by modifying your browser and our Web sites are viewable even if you disable the

your personally identifiable information but they are a technique we use to 
compile aggregated statistics about our Web site usage. Web beacons collect only 
a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page 
view and a description of the page on which the Web beacon resides. Some of our 
Web pages may also contain Web beacons placed there by our advertising partners 
to help us determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. </span></p>

the transferred assets. </span></p>
