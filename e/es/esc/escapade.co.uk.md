We also ask you for your telephone number(s) so that we can contact you easily if required. As an extra measure of security we do not collect/store any credit card information. If you are concerned about your data, you have the right subject to the payment of a small fee (currently £10) to request access to the personal data which we ma hold or process about you.

We may use your personal information to communicate with you, for record keeping purposes, and in aggregate (and therefore anonymously) for market research purposes, to track activity on our site, to publish trends and/or to improve usefulness and content.

We do not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others unless you have consented to us making your name and address available to carefully vetted companies.
