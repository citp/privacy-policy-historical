#### What information do we collect?

eSchool News Online has adopted a set of information management guidelines that serve as the basis for our customer and advertiser relationships.

#### What does eSchool News do with the information it gathers/tracks?

**Statistical Analysis and Banner Advertising:** **eSchool News Online** may perform statistical analyses of user behavior in order to measure interest in the various areas of our site (for product development purposes) and to inform advertisers as to how many consumers have seen or “clicked” their advertising banners. All information is used in aggregate form and no personal information is tied to individual users.

#### With whom does eSchool News Online share the information it gathers and tracks?

eSchool News Online uses the information it gathers to promote special pricing and discount offers for our newspaper, newsletters, directories, and conferences. The information gathered may also be shared with advertisers and other partners. eSchool News Online will provide registered users with all personal information collected at the time of registration upon request. This information will be sent only to the eMail address on file for the unique subscriber ID associated with it.

During the registration process, new users may select to register for various eMail publications. If you select this option, eSchool News Online will use the information collected on the registration form to send targeted eMails to you on behalf of advertisers. eSchool News Online subscribers may opt-out of this service at any time.

Moreover, subscribers who post a message in our communications make their eMail address available to others through a feature of our communications software, which could result in unsolicited eMail from other subscribers or parties.  


#### Children’s Guidelines:

No section of eSchool News Online is directed at children 12 and under. We collect no personally identifiable information from visitors known to be children.
