# eSchool Solutions | Privacy Policy

eSchool Solutions, Inc. ("eSchool Solutions") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains data collection and use practices of the eSchool Solutions site (the "Site"). By accessing the Site, you are consenting to the information collection and use practices described in this Privacy Policy. 

## Collection of your Personal Information : 

In order to better provide you with our numerous services, we collect two types of information about our users: Non-Personally Identifiable Information and Personally Identifiable Information. Our primary goal in collecting this information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using our site. 

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information.** This Site automatically collects certain non-identifiable information regarding Site users, such as the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer, the IP address of your Internet Service Provider, the date and time you access the Site, the sections of the Site you access, the Internet address of the Site from which you linked directly to this Site, the materials you post or download from the Site, and other various types of Non-Personally Identifiable Information. This non-identifiable information is used for Site and system administration purposes and to improve the Site. 

**Personally Identifiable Information.** This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. When you engage in certain activities on this site, sending us feedback, or submitting content and/or posting content in the Electronic Registrar Online ("ERO") or the Solution Center for the Substitute Employee Management System ("SEMS") or other areas of the Site, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form. If you elect to engage in these activities, we may ask you to provide us personal information, such as your first and last name, social security number, mailing address (including zip code), e-mail address, employer, job title, telephone number, and other personal information that may specifically identify you. Depending upon the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you may not be able to engage in that activity. 

## Use of your Personal Information : 

The personal information collected on this Site will be used to operate the Site and to 

provide the service(s) or carry out the transaction(s) you have requested or authorized. 

In support of these uses, eSchool Solutions may use personal information to provide you with more effective customer service, to improve the Site and any related eSchool Solutions products or services, and to make the Site easier to use by eliminating the need for you to 

repeatedly enter the same information or by customizing the Site to your particular 

preference or interests. In order to offer you a more consistent experience in your 

interactions with eSchool Solutions, information collected by eSchool Solutions may be combined with information collected by other eSchool Solutions services. 

We may use your personal information to provide you with important information about 

the product or service that you are using, including critical updates and notifications. 

Additionally, with your permission, we may send you information about other eSchool Solutions products and services. 

When you sign up for a newsletter or agree to receive promotional e-mail, eSchool Solutions may use customized links or similar technologies to track e-mail links that you click. We may associate that information with your personal information in order to provide you more focused e-mail communications or purchase information. Each e-mail communication includes an unsubscribe link allowing you to stop delivery of that type of communication. 

eSchool Solutions may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on eSchool Solutions or the Site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of eSchool Solutions and our family of Web sites; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of eSchool Solutions employees or agents, users of eSchool Solutions products or services, or members of the public. eSchool Solutions will not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to unrelated third-parties. 

Personal information collected on the Site may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which eSchool Solutions or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using the Site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. 

## Control of your Personal Information : 

Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, personal information you provide on the Site will not be shared outside of eSchool Solutions and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your permission. As described below in the next section, you can access your personal information and make choices about how you wish to be contacted. 

Please be aware that this Privacy Policy and any choices you make on the Site will not 

necessarily apply to personal information you may have provided to eSchool Solutions in the context of other, separately operated, eSchool Solutions products or services. 

eSchool Solutions may send out periodic e-mails informing you of technical service or security issues related to a product or service you requested, or confirming you requested a product or service. In some services offered by eSchool Solutions, contact with the customer is an intrinsic part of the service. You will not be able to choose to unsubscribe to these mailings, as they are considered an essential part of the service(s) you have chosen. 

## Use of Cookies : 

We use cookies on this Site to ensure the integrity of the registration process and to 

personalize the Site. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a 

Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. 

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process 

of delivering relevant content, eases site navigation, and so on. When you return to the Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the site's features that you customized. 

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept 

cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. 

If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive 

features of this or other Web sites you visit. 

## Updating and Correcting Information : 

We believe you should have the ability to access and edit the Personally Identifiable Information that you have provided to us. You may change any of your Personally Identifiable Information in your account online at any time by linking to your account in accordance with instructions posted elsewhere on this Site. 

## Security of Information : 

At our Site you can be assured that your Personally Identifiable Information is secure, consistent with current industry standards. The importance of security for all Personally Identifiable Information associated with our users is of utmost concern to us. Your Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information resides on a secure server that only selected eSchool Solution personnel and contractors have access to. 

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Non-Personally and Personally Identifiable Information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchange between you and us through this Site cannot be guaranteed; and, (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party. 

## Modification : 

This Privacy Policy may be changed from time-to-time at eSchool Solutions' sole discretion and without any prior notice or liability to you or any other person. The collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information by eSchool Solutions will be governed by the version of this Privacy Policy in effect at that time. New versions of this Privacy Policy will be posted here. Your continued use of the Site subsequent to any changes to this Privacy Policy will signify that you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with the changed Privacy Policy. Accordingly, when you use the Site you should check the date of this Privacy Policy and review any changes since the last version. You should also bookmark this page and periodically review this Privacy Policy to ensure that you are familiar with the most current version.
