# ESI Privacy Statement

**ESI Privacy Statement**  
Electronic Scrip Incorporated has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website. 

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information. 

We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your eScrip ID so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. 

The eScrip suite of secure applications requires users to provide contact information (like their name and email address), unique identifiers (like their group or supporter ID), financial information (like their account or credit card numbers), and demographic information (like their zip code). We use customer contact information to send the user information about our company and possible promotional material from some of our merchant partners. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. Financial information that is collected is used to check the users' qualifications for registration with the program. Unique identifiers (such as group or supporter ID) are collected to verify the user's identity and for use as account numbers in our record system. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. 

ESI will not license, sell, exchange or distribute any specific information about its eScrip participants to any third parties who are not directly involved in the eScrip program. 

This site contains links to other sites. Electronic Scrip Incorporated is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 

**Security**  
This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. The transfer of confidential information such as credit card numbers and financial data are communicated via state of-the-art encryption. Our Web server and database reside behind a firewall in a secure datacenter with fault tolerance, offsite backup and fire protection. We maintain a multi-tiered system with no direct access to the database.
