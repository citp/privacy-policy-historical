**Privacy Policy**  
  
 

**Overview**

Region 4 respects the privacy of our online visitors and will post any changes to this policy here. By using the Region 4 website, you consent to the collection and use of information as described in the current policy. Under some circumstances, Region 4 may be compelled to disclose such information in accordance with the Texas Public Information Act or other legal or administrative requirements.

Region 4 does not collect personal information about website visitors unless you choose to provide that information to us as part of an inquiry, request or order.  Should you provide such information, you are giving Region 4 permission to use that information to complete your inquiry, request or order.

Region 4 does not sell personal information to outside parties. Region 4 will not release e-mail addresses that you provide to us to outside parties except as may be required by the Texas Public information Act or as may be required by law to protect Region 4’s legal rights.  
  
   
   
  
**Personal Information**

Region 4 does not collect any specific personal information about website visitors—such as name, postal address, or e-mail address—except when such information is knowingly, and voluntarily, provided to Region 4. Personal information is obtained from online transactions such as professional development registrations, online purchases, e-mail newsletters, online surveys, membership purchases, or employment or admissions applications. If Region 4 is provided with such information, you are giving Region 4  permission to use that information to respond to or process your request. For monetary transactions the financial aspect of the transaction is temporarily stored until the transaction has been completed then purged according to standard PCI practices.

Region 4 automatically collects and stores "non-personally identifiable" information for statistical purposes. This information helps Region 4 monitor how visitors use the site. This information may include: your browser software (e.g., Internet Explorer, Mozilla, Netscape Navigator), operating system (e.g., Windows or Macintosh), name and domain of your Internet Service Provider (e.g., AOL, NET.com), and the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using.  
  
   
   
  
**Security**

The Region 4 website uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption to process registrations and all online purchases. This encryption prevents sensitive credit card information from being seen as it travels across the Internet to our servers, therefore making it difficult for anyone to intercept or decode messages exchanged over this secure connection. Credit card information is not permanently stored on the web server. Your order information, excluding private payment information, is retained for our records, but is never shared with other organizations or people.
