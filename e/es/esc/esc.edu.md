# Web Privacy Policy

#### EMPIRE STATE COLLEGE PRIVACY POLICY

 **

#### Introduction

** Empire State College is committed to protecting your privacy while making it easier and more efficient to interact with our college. You can navigate through much of the college's website without giving us any information about yourself. Sometimes we do need information to provide services that you request, and this commitment of privacy explains our online information practices. 

We do not collect any _personal information_ about you unless you provide that information voluntarily by sending an e-mail, completing an online form, or completing the online application.

This policy is consistent with the provisions of the Internet Security and Privacy Act, the Freedom of Information Law, and the Personal Privacy Protection Law.
