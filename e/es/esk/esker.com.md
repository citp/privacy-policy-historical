Esker operates under the assumption that it is generally your obligation as data controller to obtain from your customers the appropriate consent to transfer and process their data to Esker. As your data processor, Esker will not share, sell, rent, or trade with third parties for their marketing purposes any of your data or your customer's data collected by us, unless you direct us to do so and have the appropriate authorization to do so.

## ACCOUNTABILITY OF ONWARD TRANSFER

Except as described in this Policy, Esker will not share your Personal Information with third-party agents without your consent. In those instances in which Esker shares Personal Information, Esker will ensure that the third-party agent is contractually obligated to process your Personal Information only for limited, specific purposes consistent with this Policy. Esker will also ensure that the third-party agent will apply the same level of protection to your Personal Information as the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles and will notify Esker and stop processing your Personal Information if they make a determination that they can no longer meet their obligations. Esker remains responsible and liable under the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process the Personal Information on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles, unless Esker proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

## SECURITY
