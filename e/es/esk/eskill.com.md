# Privacy Policy - eSkill

eSkill Corporation (hereafter «eSkill» or «we») understands the power that the Internet holds for changing your life and making things easier for you. These benefits are at risk if people are concerned about their personal privacy. We are committed to providing you with an Internet experience that respects and protects your personal privacy choices and concerns.

Information can be collected from the users and the users’ test takers at several different points on our website.

#### 1.1 General Information 

In general, we gather information about all of our users collectively. We only use such information anonymously and in the aggregate. This information helps us determine what is most beneficial for our users, and how we can continually create a better overall experience for you.  
We may share this information with our partners, but only in the aggregate, so that they too may understand how eSkill visitors use our site, and create a better overall experience for you, as well. 

#### 1.2 Personal Information

To sign up for eSkill’s services we ask to provide certain data including: name, address, phone number, email address, contact name and credit card information (note that this last information will not be stored by eSkill only transaction histories are kept).  
eSkill administrator and test-taker functionalities requests the test takers to provide the following contact information: full name and email address (hereafter «test taker personal information»). This information is only used to contact the test taker when necessary and for storage purposes.  
Note that for the test taker personal information received from Europe and covered by the Directive 95/46/EC or received from Switzerland, eSkill applies and adheres to the US-EU Safe Harbor Framework and to the US-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework, which both includes 7 Principles and 15 FAQs for the protection of this information. This only applies to information received after eSkill joined the Safe Harbor Frameworks by self-certification. eSkill will provide, upon request, the verification statement that needs to be done at least once a year (according to FAQ 7). This statement confirms that eSkill effectively adheres to the US-EU Safe Harbor or to the US-Swiss Safe Harbor, as the case might be, and that it has been duly implemented in its organization.

In this case, we will promptly inform the user or test taker, as the case might be, of the potential disclosure or disclosure.

#### 3.1 Principle

eSkill is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this Privacy Policy.

#### 4.2 Access

#### 5.1 Security Policy

We operate secure data networks protected by industry standard firewalls and password protection. We have security measures in place, such as an organizational policy regarding security, to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the user and test taker data under our control. eSkill perform a security audit twice a year and follows PCI security policy. The compliance to this last policy is also verified twice a year through monitoring.

We impose strict rules on our employees who have access either to the databases that store user and test taker information or to the servers that host our services. All our employees need to follow organizational security policies and all of them are also bound by a confidentiality agreement. 

#### 5.3 Prevention

While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse, disclosure or alteration to data will not occur, eSkill is taking reasonable precautions to prevent such unfortunate occurrences.

This section applies to Personal Information solely as described in Section 1.2.

#### 6.1 Mechanisms for Complaint

After the test taker has exercise the rights under Sections 4.1 and 4.2 related to the modification and removal of his/her personal information, and either 1) the test taker, for whatever reasons, is not satisfied or 2) the test taker believes that eSkill didn’t fulfilled its obligation to act within a reasonable delay, the test taker can send a complaint to the [info@eskill.com](mailto:info@eskill.com) email address. eSkill will promptly reply to such a complaint and will attempt, in good faith, to resolve the complaint with the test taker if founded. Test takers can also address their complaint to BBB (Better Business Bureau), since eSkill is a BBB accredited business.

#### 6.2 Mechanisms for Complaint Regarding US-EU Safe Harbor and US-Swiss Safe Harbor
