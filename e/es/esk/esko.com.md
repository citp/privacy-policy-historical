# Esko Privacy Policy - Esko

Esko created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate our commitment to privacy. Your right to privacy and data security is a primary concern.

When you visit any Esko website, we help you maintain control over your personal data on the Internet. Below are the guidelines we use for protecting the information you provide us when you visit our website.

  * Information Gathering and Usage
  * Cookies and Web Beacons
  * Managing Your Information
  * Security
  * Contact Esko
  * Changes in this Privacy Policy



**Information Gathering and Usage**

Esko gathers information about you from data that you provide through such things as optional or mandatory registration, online surveys, contests and the Web pages you visit. The types of personal information collected can include your name, mailing address, phone number, email address and internet protocol (IP) address. We may also ask you to provide us with demographic information such as your job function, industry, application, contact preferences or experience with our products.

We generally collect this information at the time you register to use our website, subscribe to our service, post material or request further services. Esko may enhance or merge your information collected on our website with other operational data as well as data from our affiliates and third parties for purposes of marketing products or services to you. Such information enables us to better tailor our content to your needs.

The information you provide will be used to support your professional relationship with Esko and our products. Among other things, we want to help you quickly find information on our websites and alert you to information on our products, services and programs. We also use this information to help you complete a transaction and in some cases to contact you for market research.

**Links to other websites**

This website contains links to other websites that are not owned or controlled by Esko. Links to other websites will open in a new browser window. Please be aware that Esko is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our website and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by this website.

**Message boards/forums**

This website may make forums and message boards available to you. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.

**Electronic newsletters**

Esko offers various free electronic newsletters. Users can sign up by clicking on the “[Subscribe to the More! E-zine](https://web.archive.org/en/company/newsletter/more-e-zine)” button on the homepage. Or the More! E-zine link in the top navigation under Company. We don't spam, never sell or rent email addresses, and there's an easy unsubscribe in every email you'll receive. Alternately users may remove themselves from mailing lists by sending an email to [privacy@esko.com](mailto:privacy@esko.com).

**Contests**

Esko may offer contests in which we request certain personal information. At a minimum, the required information includes name and email address. In some cases, the entrant must answer mandatory survey questions about a range of technical interests and personal data. The information gathered in the entry form is used to verify the entrant's identity and eligibility, to contact winners or prize recipients, and to market and sell our products. Because the rules and terms of each contest can vary, all information about each contest is clearly posted during the event.

**Log files**

Like most standard website servers, we use log files to automatically log information such as IP addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. We log this information to analyze trends, administer our website, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We do not use this information to identify you. For areas of our website that require registration, we log the user's email address and specific information concerning the user's activity on our website. This information may be tied to the user's other personal information and, if so, it is used to support the user's professional relationship with Esko and our products.

We may periodically use the Click Tale web analytics service on our website to help us research website issues and to help us improve our visitors' experience on our website.  When enabled, Click Tale records mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity as well as any text you type on the pages on which it is enabled.  
This site does not use ClickTale to collect any personally identifiable information entered in this website. ClickTale does not track your browsing habits across web sites which do not use ClickTale services.  
You can choose to disable the Service at [Disable Clicktale](http://www.clicktale.net/disable.html).  
For more information on the information that is Collected by the ClickTale Web Analytics Service, see Click Tales privacy policy: <http://www.clicktale.com/privacy-policy>

Esko will not share, sell or rent your personal information for promotional purposes and will not disclose your personal information to outside organizations unless they are affiliated with Esko. Distributors, rental partners, affiliates, contractors, or other business partners of Esko may have access to your personal information but will only use your information in connection with your customer relationship with Esko and our products.

**Where we store your personal data**  
We may transfer your personal information to, or store it at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order and the provision of support services.
