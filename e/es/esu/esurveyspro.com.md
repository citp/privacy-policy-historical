**Information Collection**

**We will not use the information collected from your surveys in any way, shape, or form.   In addition, any other material you provide us (including images, email addresses, etc.) will be held in the strict confidence.**

In addition, we do not collect personally identifiable information about you except when you specifically provide this information on a voluntary basis.   We will make every effort to ensure that whatever information you provide will be maintained in a secure environment.  

However, even if you opt out of receiving any communications from eSurveysPro.com, we reserve the right to contact you regarding your account status or any other matter that might affect our service to you and/or our records on you.  

 **Information Use**

eSurveysPro.com reserves the right to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics.  We do this in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the website. 

eSurveysPro.com collects IP addresses for system administration and record keeping.  Your IP address is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the World Wide Web.  Our servers record incoming IP addresses.  The IP addresses are analyzed only in aggregate; no connection is made between you and your computer's IP address.  By tracking IP addresses, we can determine which sites refer the most people to eSurveysPro.com.  (Think of an IP address like your zip code; it tells us in general terms where you're from.)

 **Cookies**

"Cookies" are small text files a website can use to recognize repeat users.  eSurveysPro.com uses cookies to recognize visitors and more quickly provide personalized content or grant you unimpeded access to the website.  With cookies enabled, you will not need to fill in password or contact information.  

Information gathered through cookies also helps us measure use of our website.  Cookie data allow us to track usage behavior and compile data that we can use to improve the site.   This data will be used in aggregate form; no specific users will be tracked.  

Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the user that has no meaning outside of the Web site that he or she is visiting.   You can easily turn off cookies.  Most browsers have a feature that allows the user to refuse cookies or issues a warning when cookies are being sent.   However, our site will not function properly without cookies.  Enabling cookies ensures a smooth, efficient visit to our website.  

**Opting Out**

Upon request, eSurveysPro.com will allow any user to opt out of our monthly newsletter.  Also, upon your request, eSurveysPro.com will delete you and your personal information from our database; however, it may be impossible to delete all of your information without some residual data because of backups and records of deletions.
