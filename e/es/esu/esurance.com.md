You may NOT unsubscribe from these Esurance-specific communications that relate to your primary usage of our service and products, and you agree to receive these communications if you make a purchase.

When you quote or become a policyholder with us, Esurance may contact you about third-party promotions, our products and services and other information that may be useful to you.

### Confidential and secure web environment

Esurance is strongly committed to protecting the confidentiality and security of your information against unauthorized access and disclosure. We only disclose your information to our personnel, our affiliates' personnel, others who need to know that information to service your account, and as otherwise permitted or required by law. We maintain strict physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your information.

Separate from information you provide to us individually via our website, Esurance uses web beacons on our website and in our emails to collect general information about visits to our website as part of our business tracking. This information is used to enhance your website experience and includes, for example, data regarding how you linked to our website, your Internet protocol (IP) address, your browser and/or device type, and your time of visit. This information does not include your name, address, telephone number or email address. Esurance may use third-party web analytic and advertising services to assist with collecting and tracking of this information.

In addition, Esurance's third-party ad servers may use technology that includes web beacons on websites on which we advertise, to support site tracking, measure site performance, enhance your website experience, and for product marketing. For example, one of our third-party ad servers may place a cookie via a web beacon on your computer that helps to identify your computer when you arrive at or return to our site, to personalize aspects of your experience at our site, and to better understand how visitors like you in aggregate are using our site, all of which helps us to continually improve the experience on our site. These web beacons do not collect personally identifiable information (such as your name, address, telephone number or email address).

Another use of web beacons and cookies is for Esurance to advertise on other websites. In this common practice (sometime referred to as re-targeting), our third-party ad server or an advertising vendor may use beacons to place cookies on your computer when you visit the Esurance websites, in order to display Esurance advertising messages to you later on other websites. We do not allow those third party ad servers or advertising vendors to use beacons on our site to place cookies that will be used to display advertising for any companies other than Esurance. To learn more, or to opt-out of this type of targeting by third party ad servers/vendors that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative and the Digital Advertising Alliance, please visit <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp> and <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>.

### Confidentiality for victims of domestic violence in New York

The state of New York prohibits many types of discrimination against domestic abuse victims. It is unlawful for any insurance company to deny or cancel a policy, refuse to renew a policy, set a limit of coverage, or base insurance rates on the basis of being a victim of domestic abuse. If you and/or your child have experienced domestic violence, and you have obtained a valid Order of Protection directly related to the abuse, Esurance will take appropriate actions to protect you and/or your child's information. This includes safeguarding your name, address, and phone number. For more information, please review [Esurance's information on New York domestic abuse confidentiality](https://www.esurance.com/HomeContent/Home/pdf/Notice-on-Confidentiality-for-Domestic-Violence-Victims.pdf).
