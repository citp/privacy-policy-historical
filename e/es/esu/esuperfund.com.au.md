##  Collection of Personal Information 

You provide ESUPERFUND with your personal information when you ask for information about ESUPERFUND's services, when you access and use the ESUPERFUND website and its affiliated websites, the ESUPERFUND Mobile App, and/or when you submit an application with ESUPERFUND.

By using and accessing this website and the mobile app or by submitting an application with ESUPERFUND, you have consented to ESUPERFUND collecting, maintaining, using and disclosing personal information about you and provided by you or by another person as described below.

In most cases, we collect personal information about you directly from you. However, in some cases if you give us personal information about another person, you represent that you are authorised to do so and agree to inform that person who we are, that we will use and disclose that information for the relevant purposes set out below, and that they can access the information we hold about them.

We are required by law to collect information to identify and verify you. ESUPERFUND may make enquiries as to your identity(ies) and other personal details. For instance we may ask for identification such as your name, address and date of birth.

The Privacy Act also protects your sensitive information. While ESUPERFUND usually does not need to collect, use or disclose sensitive information about you (such as health information), if we require such information we will only collect it with your consent, except where otherwise permitted by law.

If you do not provide the personal information that we request, we will generally not be able to provide you with ESUPERFUND products or services.

##  Use of your personal information 

The information requested in any application completed by you is required to enable us to provide a service to you. That information, together with the information collected and maintained by ESUPERFUND during the course of our relationship with you, is used to provide, manage and administer the services to you.

##  Disclosure of your personal information 

The general rule is that we will not use or disclose your personal information other than for the purposes stated at the time of the collection. If we want to use your personal information for another purpose, we will seek further consent from you, unless that other purpose is related to one of the original purposes of collection and you would reasonably expect us to use your personal information for that other purpose.

It may be necessary for ESUPERFUND to disclose your information to our representatives, employees, agents and affiliates for the purpose of providing services to ESUPERFUND. Our representatives, employees, agents and affiliates who have access to personal data obtained through the ESUPERFUND website and the ESUPERFUND Mobile App are obliged to respect privacy.

Personal information will only be disclosed to third parties other than those we have specifically identified if you have consented to the disclosure; if you would reasonably expect us to disclose information of that kind to those third parties; if we are authorised or required to do so by law; or it is necessary to assist with law enforcement. For example, we may disclose your information to governmental agencies or entities, regulatory authorities, or other persons in line with applicable rules, official requests, orders, subpoenas or similar processes as either required or permitted by applicable law.

ESUPERFUND may have to send your personal information to service providers or other third party providers outside of Australia to assist with our product and services. These countries include but may not be limited to Singapore and China. Where we do this, we make sure that appropriate data handling and security arrangements are in place.

ESUPERFUND takes all reasonable steps to protect your personal information from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.

##  Marketing 

By accessing this website and the mobile app you consent to us sending commercial electronic messages (including messages about our products and services) to any electronic address which you provide or for which you are responsible. You warrant that you have authority, either as or on behalf of the electronic account holder, to provide this consent and agree that until you withdraw your consent by providing written notice to us or using an unsubscribe facility in the message, we may continue to send commercial electronic messages to those addresses.

##  Access to and update your personal information 

You have the right to seek access to and update or correct the personal information we hold about you by writing to us via email at info@esuperfund.com.au or via mail at PO BOX 401 North Melbourne VIC 3051.

You may ask us at any time to correct personal information held by ESUPERFUND about you, and which you believe is inaccurate. If we disagree with you as to the accuracy of the information, you may request that we attach a statement to that information noting that you consider it inaccurate or incomplete.

Please note that requests for access to your personal information may only be made by you. Another person who you have authorised to make a request on your behalf, such as a legal guardian or an authorised agent cannot access your personal information from ESUPERFUND directly. We will require you to verify your identity, to our reasonable satisfaction. Depending on the nature and/or volume of the information that you request, an access charge may apply, but not to your request for access itself.
