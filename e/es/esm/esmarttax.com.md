# eSmart Tax Privacy Statement - FREE online income tax software filing, IRS e-File tax return form for Federal & State, 1040 tax forms and more.

[](http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.esmarttax.com&sealid=101)**At JTH Tax, Inc. d/b/a Liberty Tax Service (referred to as Liberty Tax Service, "us" or "we" in this Privacy Policy), we are dedicated to serving your needs. We know you care about your personal privacy. Because we care about you, we have adopted the practices described in this Privacy Policy.**

**eSmart Tax is Covered**

**This Privacy Policy applies to use of the eSmart Tax Online income tax preparation service. It does not apply to other portions of our website or to services offered through our office locations.**

**The Information We Collect**

eSmart Tax collects your tax-related information such as your name, address, income, birth date, social security number, employment and other information necessary to prepare and electronically file your tax return. You also provide to us your Username, Password, Password Prompt Question, e-mail address and telephone number as part of the registration process to use this service. We also collect the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer from which the return originated (see discussion under “URL and IP Address” below). If you pay by credit card, we collect your credit card type, number, and expiration date. If you pay by e-check or request direct deposit of your tax refund, we collect the bank name, and bank account and routing number.

**The Way We Use Information**

The tax return information that we collect is used to prepare and, if requested, electronically file your tax return. The tax return information is used only as authorized by you or as allowed by law.

The IRS requires us to provide to them the IP address of the computer from which the return originated, as well as the e-mail address of the person who electronically filed the return.

Your credit card information or bank account information will be shared with credit card processing companies to bill you for services purchased.

If you apply for a bank product such as a refund anticipation loan, your information will be shared with the lending bank upon your express authorization and the bank’s use of that information will be covered by the bank’s privacy policy.

The information you give us also allows us to statistically analyze Site usage, improve our content and product offerings, and customize our Site's content, layout and services.

We will send you service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, we might send you an e-mail to announce the start of the IRS filing season and our service each year, the filing status and result for your tax return, actions required to complete your e-file, or if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance.

Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications because our tax e-file services include e-file, processing, submission, result analysis and possibly resubmission required for the tax return. Without these communications, you may not find out if your tax return has been accepted by the IRS or not, resulting in refund delay or other difficulties.

We will send you tax related information in a newsletter to your email address if you have authorized it.

**Choice/Opt-Out**

If you do not wish to receive tax information, including the newsletter, you may opt-out of receiving it by following the instructions included in each email or on the Update Profile page by visiting the following URL: <https://onlinetax.esmarttax.com/gateway.asp>.

**Restrictions on Disclosing Information To Third Parties.**

We are not in the business of selling or renting your personally identifiable information to others. We do not reveal personally identifiable information about you to third parties (outside of any affiliate or subsidiary we may have) for their independent use unless: (1) you request or authorize it; (2) the information is provided to complete a transaction for you; (3) the information is provided to comply with the law or in response to a subpoena or other legal process; or (4) the disclosure is done as part of a purchase, sale or transfer of services or assets (for example, if substantially all of your assets are acquired by another party, your information may be one of the transferred assets).
