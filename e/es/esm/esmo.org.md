### Introduction

This privacy policy applies to your use of the websites (collectively referred to as the “Website”), operated by The European Society for Medical Oncology, a Swiss-based not-for-profit Society, and referred to interchangeably hereafter as “ESMO”.

The “Website” includes, without limitation, the ESMO website (www.esmo.org) and any specific versions (e.g.  [ oncologypro.esmo.org](http://oncologypro.esmo.org/)) or filters thereof, the Rare Cancers Europe website ( [ www.rarecancerseurope.org](http://www.rarecancerseurope.org/)), and any other online platforms used by ESMO which could require your personal data.

ESMO respects your privacy and is committed to protecting the confidentiality of your personal information. This policy explains how ESMO collects and uses Member, ESMO organised meeting or event, customer and site visitor information, and how it protects your privacy. It also explains how you can manage your own personal information held by ESMO in the ‘myESMO’ area on the ESMO Website.

This policy applies to personal information held about individuals. It does not apply to information ESMO holds about companies and other organisations. It is in addition to any specific policies concerning specific products or services. It does not supersede the ESMO terms and conditions which govern the use of the ESMO Website. ESMO reserves the right to amend this privacy policy at its sole discretion, without prior notice, at any time, with the provison that details of the amendments are published on the ESMO Website. They become effective from the time of posting. ESMO is the sole owner of the Website and as such is the sole owner of any information collected through the Website.

ESMO is committed to the following standards, on a commercially reasonable basis:

  1. To collect and use only the minimal amount of information necessary for us to deliver high quality service to users, to administer our business, and to inform you of ESMO products and services
  2. To protect the information you share with us, maintaining strong standards of security and confidentiality
  3. To require any other organisation that we retain or engage to provide support services to us to conform General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) privacy standards, and
  4. To aim to keep data complete, up to date, and accurate



The Website may require you to register as a user and to receive our authorisation before you can use particular features. Whether you are an individual or a corporation, partner, or other form of commercial enterprise, in order for you obtain our authorisation to use those features and to be considered a registered user, you may be required to provide us with certain information about yourself or your business and, if a business, information about any or all individuals you designate to represent that business in connection with your use of the Website (e.g. names, addresses, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, and other Personally Identifiable Information of each individual who uses the Website). Once ESMO has authorised you as a registered user, ESMO will assign a customer identification number. Your username will be your email address and you will be requested to create your own password.

You will be able to change your password and update any personal data you have provided. Please note that submitting information is not a guarantee or assurance that ESMO will authorise you, or anyone you designate, to use any or all of the services of the Website. If for any reason you are not granted authorisation ESMO will retain the information you submit only in order to communicate with you regarding your application. ESMO may, however, request additional or follow-up information for audit purposes or as may be required by law or regulation.

If you are a third party submitting personal information on behalf of others (for registration purposes or otherwise) you represent; this action implies that you have their permission, agreement and full authorisation to provide this information to us. ESMO reserves the right (a) to ask you to provide evidence of your authority at any time during, or even after, the submission process and (b) to contact those individuals to confirm your authority at any time.

### Use of Cookies

Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer’s hard disk for record keeping purposes. They are small text files that a website can use to recognise repeat users and facilitate their ongoing access to, and use of, the site. They do not pose a threat to your system or files.

The use of cookies is an industry standard, and many websites use them to provide useful features. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users.

We use analytics cookies and tracking in an aggregate manner to operate and improve the websites and for marketing analysis where the personal information is completely anonymised since it is summarised. More info about analytics in the paragraph below.

### Use of web analytics

As a website gathers individual pieces of Information from its users, it may combine similar data from many or all the users of the website into one big “batch.” This sort of statistical information is called aggregate data because it reflects the habits and characteristics of a large group of anonymous people. Websites may use aggregate data or share it with business partners so that the information and services they provide best meet the needs of the users. Aggregate data also helps advertisers and sponsors on the Web know how effectively they are reaching and meeting the needs of their target audience.

Click Stream Information. A record of all the pages you have visited during your visit to a Website or the services you accessed from the site or from an email. Click Stream Information is associated with your browser and not with you personally. It records the archives of your browser.

(1) ESMO android Apps use Google Analytics App Tracking, an analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics App Tracking uses “ID’s”, which are identifier generated and saved on your device, to help us analyse how the app is being used across users. The information about your use of the app (including your IP address) which is generated by the ID will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. In case of activation of the IP anonymisation, Google will truncate/anonymise the last octet of the IP address for Member States of the European Union as well as for other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases, the full IP address is sent to and shortened by Google servers in the USA. 

Google will use this information on our behalf for evaluating your use of the app, compiling reports on your activity in the app and other services relating to app activity and internet usage to us. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. 

You may refuse the logging of the information about your use of the app (including your IP Address) generated by the ID of Google Analytics App Tracking by selecting “disable Google Analytics” in the settings of the app. Henceforth, any further tracking will be stopped as you will have “opted-out“ by selecting the disable setting. However, please note that this applies only to this version of the app. In other apps tracking still might be activated. 

In this app the IP anonymisation is activated. 

More information about the terms and conditions and the privacy policy can be found under [ http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/](http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/) and [ https://www.google.com/policies/](https://www.google.com/policies/) 

(2) You have the possibility to create notes and bookmarks.

iOS user: This data will not be saved on your device and will be lost in the case of an app update or the reinstallation of the app on your device. We therefore recommend you use the backup software provided by Apple to save your notes and bookmarks on iCloud so that you may restore your data. iCloud is a could service provided by Apple; please review the respective disclaimer and privacy policy from Apple.

Android user: This data is stored on the SD card of your device and can be restored in case of app updates or reinstalling the app. If you change the location / file storage of backups manually, the app is unable to access your notes and bookmarks. 

(3) You also have the possibility to send a feedback e-mail directly from the app. In the e-mail template, the software version of your device, the app version as well as the type of your device will be automatically included. This information is necessary to process your request; you do, however, have the option to delete this information from the e-mail, if you choose not to send it to us. Your data will remain with us only for the duration of time it takes to process your request. 

The ESMO Events app and ESMO Academy app require login on a third party platform (Conference Compass and SpotMe respectively) for authorisation and platform access. These third parties confirm GDPR compliance.
