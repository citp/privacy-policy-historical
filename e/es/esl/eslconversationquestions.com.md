# Privacy Policy - ESL Conversation Questions

## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, ESL Conversation Questions collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, usage patterns and the date and time of each visitor request.

An example being our use of Google Analytics to better understand visitor behavior.

ESL Conversation Questions uses Google Analytics reports to better understand visitor behavior to better serve the needs of our visitors. We have implemented Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting.

ESL Conversation Questions uses this data to better understand it’s audience and to improve product development. ESL Conversation Questions will not facilitate the merging of personally-identifiable information with non-personally identifiable information previously collected from Display Advertising features that is based on the DoubleClick cookie unless ESL Conversation Questions has robust notice of, and the user’s prior affirmative (i.e., opt-in) consent to, that merger. Using the [Ads Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/ads), visitors can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads.

Google also has a browser addon to opt-out of Google Analytics which can be found [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).
