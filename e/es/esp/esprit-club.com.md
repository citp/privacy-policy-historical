# Your privacy

We do not collect any personally identifiable information from the visitors to our website. We monitor visitor traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop the design and layout of the website and to plan for a better collection of our products and services.

When you join as a member or offer your e-mail address to receive e-mails from us, we may collect information such as your name, e-mail address and/or date of birth to identify and to communicate with you as one of our members. The supply of personal information by the members or intended members is entirely voluntary, though without sufficient details we may not be able to serve you fully as a member. For example, your e-mail address enables us to inform you of our news, updates and members' privileges.

When you enter a contest or other promotion, we may ask for your name, address and e-mail address so we can administer the contest and notify the winners.

When you order, we collect information such as your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone and credit card numbers. We will also send you e-mails to confirm your order and may need to contact you by phone, post or e-mail if we have other questions regarding your order. We also maintain a record of your product interests and your purchases on-line and in our stores. Again, the provision of personal information is entirely voluntary, but without sufficient details we may not be able to process your order.

To serve you better, we may combine information you give us on-line, in our shops and through any application of Esprit cards as well as information about your product interests and purchases. In addition, we may combine information you provide with general information that is publically available. We use this combined information to improve and personalise our service to you, and to communicate with you by e-mail or post about our products, services, contests, and promotions that may be of interest to you.

We keep confidential all personally identifiable information you provide us. However, we do disclose your personal information under certain circumstances. These include making disclosure when we believe, in good faith, that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to:

a.  
comply with the law;

b.  
maintain or develop our website and our business;

c.  
enforce or apply the terms of any of our agreements; or

d.  
protect the rights, property or safety of this website, our users, or others.

We may team up with other companies to promote or provide products, services, contests or promotions. Subject to safeguards, we and such other company may need to cross-check our databases to avoid duplication or to use the combined information to identify and organise future marketing and promotions.

You can tell us not to share your e-mail address and other personal data simply by sending a blank e-mail message to [nosharing@esprit-intl.com](mailto:nosharing@esprit-intl.com). Clicking the hotlink would activate your mail program.

We may also share aggregate, non-personally identifiable information, such as age, gender, and types of products purchased, with our business partners. Such non-personally identifiable information will not include your e-mail address or any other information that uniquely refers to you.

We do not sell or rent any information you provide to us.

A "cookie" is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored in the hard drive of your computer. We use cookies to help us provide customisable services. Cookies also make web-surfing easier for you by saving your preferences while you are on our site.

Cookies do not damage your system or impair its functioning in any way. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies, or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent. If you choose not to accept these cookies, your experience at our site and other websites may be diminished and some features may not work as intended.

This website may contain links to third parties' websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any such sites. This statement of privacy policy applies solely to information collected by this website. We advise you to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.

Protecting your order information is a priority for us. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your on-line order information. The SSL encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us.

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information on-line, we also do everything in our power to protect personally identifiable information off-line. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.

We are concerned about the safety of children in their use of the internet. We will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent. If we receive actual knowledge that a member is under the age of 13 and has registered without his or her parent or guardian's permission, we will remove from our files all personally identifiable registration information about that child.

You have the right to request access to and correction of the information about you held by us. If you wish to access or correct your personal information with us, please e-mail [privacy@esprit-intl.com](mailto:privacy@esprit-intl.com). Clicking the hotlink would activate your mail program.

We want to communicate with you only if you wish to hear from us. If you would rather not receive marketing or promotional communication from us, please inform us by sending a blank e-mail message to [off@esprit-intl.com](mailto:off@esprit-intl.com). Clicking the hotlink would activate your mail program.

By using our website, you consent to the collection and use of your information by Esprit International. When we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post the changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.

We are committed to safeguard your privacy with us. We use the information we collect on-line to enhance and improve your experience of being served by us. The supply of personal information to us is entirely voluntary. We do not sell or rent your personal information to others. We want to communicate with you only if you wish to hear from us.

If you wish to access, change or delete your information with us, please e-mail us at [privacy@esprit-intl.com](mailto:privacy@esprit-intl.com). You can tell us not to share your e-mail address and other personal data with third party by sending a blank e-mail message to [nosharing@esprit-intl.com](mailto:nosharing@esprit-intl.com). If you would not like to receive any announcement, news, special offer or promotional materials from us, please send a blank e-mail message to [off@esprit-intl.com](mailto:off@esprit-intl.com).
