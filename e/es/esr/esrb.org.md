### What information does this Privacy Policy cover?

This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected on or after the Last Updated date of this Privacy Policy and only to information collected on the Websites. It does not apply to any other information collected by ESRB through any other means, including information that may be collected by ESRB offline. Nor does it apply to ESRB’s mobile application or any other websites or online services maintained by ESRB or by any of ESRB’s international affiliates. Finally, this Privacy Policy does not apply to any websites or other online services maintained by other companies or organizations to which ESRB links. ESRB is therefore not responsible for the content or activities provided on those websites or other online services. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of all third-parties and exercise caution in connection with them.

 **Cookies**

We use Google Analytics to provide web analytics data about how our Websites are used, including to identify the website that linked you to our Websites. To provide this information, Google Analytics places a cookie on your web browser. We have configured Google Analytics so that none of the information it collects consists of or is linked to personal information belonging to you.  

Moreover, videos appearing on the Websites are hosted by YouTube, which enables third-party cookies and ad tags from DoubleClick (Google) the moment a user visits one of the Websites. Google may use these cookies and tags to track you on the Websites and across other sites.      

You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You can do this through the settings in your browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge or Mozilla Firefox). Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser’s Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, some of the features of the Websites might not function properly. 

For more information about the third-party cookies on the Websites, including your opt-out choices, please refer to our chart below.

 **Pixels**

A pixel is a piece of code installed on a website.  Our Websites have Facebook and Twitter pixels installed, which Facebook and Twitter utilize to serve targeted ads.  Facebook and Twitter collect various information about you through the pixels, including information about your activity on our Websites.  For our use, Facebook and Twitter use this information to provide us with targeted audiences to serve our ads. However, ESRB does not receive any personal data from Facebook and Twitter about you or the target audience.

 **Do Not Track (DNT) Disclosure**

Your browser may allow you to set a “do not track” (DNT) signal indicating that you do not wish your online activity to be tracked. Currently, our system does not support and cannot act on DNT signal headers that we may receive. However, the choices that we provide you concerning collection and use of your personal information will continue to operate as described in this Privacy Policy.

### How is your information used?

We may use your information for various operational purposes. For example, we may use your information to send you administrative communications, including any future changes to this Privacy Policy. In addition, as discussed further below, we may utilize your information to send you email updates; address your inquiries, comments or complaints; or fulfill requests to rate a game or app. 

 **Email Updates**

Our email updates are powered by third-party Mailchimp®.  To review Mailchimp®’s privacy practices, please see the “Privacy for Contacts” section of its [privacy policy](https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/). If you choose to sign up, we will utilize your email address and, if provided, first name, to send you email updates.    

You voluntarily provide us with this information, and we process it consistent with our legitimate interests. If you prefer not to disclose the information, you will still be able to utilize the Websites, but you will not be able to sign up for email updates.

We retain this information unless and until you unsubscribe from our email updates, or you otherwise contact us to request that we delete this information.

 **User Inquiries, Comments and Complaints**

If you contact us using one of our online contact forms to submit a question, comment or complaint, we utilize the information you provide us to best address your complaint or inquiry. For example, if you submit a complaint about a video game retailer, we contact that retailer on your behalf to attempt to resolve your complaint. If you contact us with an inquiry or complaint regarding a rating assigned to a video game or app, we will either do our best to address your inquiry or complaint ourselves (if you are in North America), or we will advise you of the organization best suited to do so (if you are outside North America).  

You voluntarily provide us with this information, and we process it consistent with our legitimate interests. If you prefer not to disclose the information, you will still be able to utilize the Websites, but you will not be able to submit a complaint, make an inquiry, or otherwise contact us through the Websites.

Except as set forth in the next sentence or in the unusual circumstance when additional time is needed to adequately address your inquiry or complaint, we will delete your email after 12 months. If your complaint is directed at ESRB Privacy Certified and concerns a member of the Privacy Certified program’s failure to abide by the Privacy Certified program requirements, your email and any other documents relating to your complaint will be retained for 3 years by statute.

 **Rating Customers**

Sections of the Websites are dedicated to ESRB’s business function of rating computer and video games and online apps. If you are a video game or app publisher and you submit a video game or app to be rated by ESRB, we utilize the personal and business information you provide us to rate the video game or app you submit to us, to maintain a historical record of the rating, and to obtain payment for our rating services.  

We consider this to be a legitimate commercial interest that justifies our collection of your information.  Moreover, our collection may be necessitated by our contractual obligations to provide and track ratings, all of which is in the public’s interest.  However, the decision whether to provide the information to us, belongs to you. If you prefer not to disclose the information, you will still be able to utilize the Websites, but you will not be able to submit a game or app for rating.

Except for the credit card information used for payment, we maintain the information obtained in connection with a rating, including the personal and business information you provide us, in a database. Because our rating of a game or app does not expire, we maintain this information indefinitely, meaning we will not delete it.  

We do not store your credit card information, except the last 4 digits of the credit card number and the cardholder’s name. We maintain this information only as long as necessary to satisfy its operational purpose.

As set forth below, whether and when we share your information depends on the type of information.

 **Email Updates**

Our email updates are powered by third-party Mailchimp®.  To review Mailchimp®’s privacy practices, please see the “Privacy for Contacts” section of its [privacy policy](https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/).

Unless we have a legal obligation to do so or it is necessary to address your complaint, we will not share this information with any third parties, except our service providers and processors.

 **User Inquiries, Comments and Complaints**

We do not share with any third parties the personal information you provide us when you create a publisher account to submit a video game or app to be rated by ESRB, except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy or if you choose to pay for our service by credit card through one of the Websites.  If you choose to pay for our rating service by credit card through one of the Websites, your credit card and billing information is securely sent to our merchant services provider to process payment. Our merchant services vendor is required to maintain the confidentiality of your credit card information and is prohibited from using it for any other purpose.  

 **Aggregate Information**

We may take your personal information and make it non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other individuals) or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you (anonymizing your information). Given the nature of this information, no restrictions apply under this Privacy Policy on our right to aggregate or anonymize your personal information, and we may use and share the anonymized information in any way with third parties.

 **Mergers, Acquisitions, etc.**

If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of ESRB or our assets to another organization (e.g., in the course of a transaction like a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation), your personal information and any other information collected through our Websites may be among the items sold or transferred. The buyer or transferee will be required to honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy Policy.

 **Disclosures Required By Law and Disclosures to Help Protect the Security and Safety of Our Websites and Others**

We may disclose personal information (a) in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law; (b) if doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to any claims; or (d) to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of ESRB, users, or the public.

### What kinds of security measures do we take to safeguard your personal information?

The security and confidentiality of your information is extremely important to us. We use robust security measures to protect user information from loss, misuse and alteration.
