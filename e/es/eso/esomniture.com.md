COOKIES AND CLEAR GIFS

  
What Are Cookies  
Cookies are files that web browsers place on a visitors computer hard drive and are used to allow a more enjoyable visit with easier use of site and to more accurately track visitor behaviors to our site. Cookies come in two flavors: session and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you've closed your browser or turned off your computer. Cookies do not identify you personally. They merely recognize your browser, unless you choose to identify yourself voluntarily. You may choose to identify yourself for any one of the following reasons: asking the browser to remember your username and password, by responding to a promotional offer, when personalizing a web page or requesting more information on a product or service, otherwise you remain as an anonymous web site visitor. 

How We Use Cookies  
When you interact with the Omniture web site, we strive to make that experience easy and meaningful. When you come to our Site, our web server uses cookies to improve our visitors' interaction with our site. All Omniture cookies are P3P compliant. 

Omniture uses session cookies to track web visitor behavior and to allow our customers to immediately save the username and password as well as personal settings on specific pages. This allows Omniture to process your saved login information and quickly log you into the product. Session cookies also help us make sure you are who you say you are after you've logged in. 

Omniture uses persistent cookies, that only Omniture can read and use, to identify the fact that you are an Omniture customer or a prior Omniture web site visitor (whatever the case may be). We are especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. Users who disable their web browsers' ability to accept cookies will still be able to browse our web site, however they may loose some of the functionality provided by the use of persistent cookies. When examining your cookies you may notice a cookie being set by the domain 2O7.net. The 2O7.net domain is the primary domain Omniture uses to track visitor behavior to both our own web site and that of our customers. 

What are Clear Gifs?  
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. The main difference between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear gifs are not tied to users' personally identifiable information. 

How We Use Clear Gifs  
To help us improve visitor experience and manage site content, we utilize clear gifs (a.k.a Web Beacons) to track visitor behavior.
