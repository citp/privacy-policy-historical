This Privacy Policy should be read in connection with our Website Terms and Conditions.

In addition, if you register as a user of any of the features of our Website (a “Subscriber”), during the registration process (and from time to time as eSignal may require) you will be prompted to click an “I Accept,” “Submit” or similar button, which further confirms your agreement to be legally bound by this Privacy Policy.

2.0 Scope of Policy  
This Privacy Policy applies only to information you provide to us online or that we collect from you while visiting or using our Website. It does not apply to information we have obtained offline or through other means. 

3.0 What Information We Collect and Use   
eSignal reserves the right to use and control the information collected on the Website.

> 4.2. Resellers: eSignal may from time to time enter into agreements with companies that resell eSignal’s products or services, either on eSignal’s behalf, or on their own behalf on a private labeled basis and/or on a co-branded basis. Under the terms of these agreements, we may be required, and therefore we reserve the right, to share your personally identifiable information with such resellers. Once your personally identifiable information is provided to such resellers, it will no longer be covered by this privacy policy. In those instances, your personally identifiable information will be governed by the privacy policy of the resellers to whom it is provided. Notwithstanding the foregoing, eSignal will not share your Order Information with any reseller that is not billing you directly for the re-marketed, private labeled and/or co-branded eSignal services to which you subscribe.

In addition, merchants of the products you purchase or to which you subscribe through eSignal may request additional personally identifiable information from you. eSignal will provide the merchants of such products the information you supply in response to those requests and, following such disclosure by eSignal, your personally identifiable information will no longer be covered by this policy. In those instances, your personally identifiable information is governed by the privacy policy of the merchants whose products you have purchased or to which you have subscribed.

> 4.4. Imminent Harm: We may reveal your personally identifiable information to attorneys, private investigator organizations or law enforcement agencies if we believe that you are harming or interfering (or will imminently harm or interfere) with other eSignal users or anyone else or violating (either intentionally or unintentionally) our Website Terms and Conditions of Use or infringing any of eSignal’s legal rights.
> 
> 4.5. Legal: eSignal will reveal your personally identifiable information, to the extent we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law.

Finally, if you request, we will remove your name and other personally identifiable information from our databases. Please understand, however, that it may be impossible to remove this information completely, due to backups and records of deletions. If you wish to remove your name and other personally identifiable information from our database, please create an email with the term “Unsubscribe” in the subject line, and send the email to the address listed in Section 12.0 of this Privacy Policy. As an alternative, you may write to us with your request, at the mailing address set forth in Section 12.0.

6.0 Communications to our Users

> 6.1. eSignal: eSignal sends emails and/or postal mailings to new subscribers and to provide to existing subscribers information regarding their specific eSignal products. Periodically, eSignal will send news and information to subscribers and other parties who have expressed interest in eSignal and its products. These communications are an information service to users who have indicated a preference to receive promotions relating to eSignal’s products, Website and services, and to receive special offers relating to third-party products, sites and services. You can opt out of receiving these promotional communications through the Self-Maintenance area of our Website. For so long as you use eSignal products and services or otherwise maintain a business relationship with eSignal, however, you may not opt out of receiving communications from eSignal relating specifically to those products and services or business relationship.
> 
> 6.2. Third Parties: Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we do not share personally identifiable information with anyone, unless we have informed you of a change to our Privacy Policy and given you the opportunity to then choose to opt out. Once you have indicated that your information may be shared with third parties or you have responded to an offer by any third party on the Website, eSignal can no longer update any of your personally identifiable information that has been transferred to such third parties or opt you out of such third parties so that you no longer receive their promotional and/or marketing information. Instead, you must either contact that third party or refer to its privacy policy to update your personally identifiable information or to let the third party know that you no longer want to receive promotional and/or marketing information about its products, services or offerings.

7.0 Security of Personally Identifiable Information   
eSignal maintains controls to protect the financial information you provide us, including credit card details, during the product purchase process. These controls include: (1) the use of SSL encryption to safeguard information when transmitted from your web browser to eSignal; (2) the logical authentication security within the databases that store customers’ credit card numbers; and (3) use of encryption of credit card numbers.   
eSignal employees are required to acknowledge that they understand and will strictly abide by our corporate policies with respect to the confidentiality of personally identifiable information. Moreover, eSignal only gives access to databases containing personally identifiable information to employees on a need-to-know basis. Internal policies require that passwords be changed regularly, pursuant to security protocols. Our security procedures are reviewed on a periodic basis to ensure that they remain current.  
Accordingly, we have put in place security systems designed to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information you provide to us. These systems are structured to deter and prevent hackers and others from accessing this information. Due to the nature of Internet communications and evolving technologies, however, we cannot provide, and disclaim, assurance that the information you provide us will remain free from loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties who, despite our efforts, obtain unauthorized access.

8.0 Children   
Persons under the age of eighteen (18) are not permitted to register for the eSignal service and eSignal does not knowingly collect, either online or offline, personally identifiable information from persons under the age of eighteen (18). If we learn that a child under (18) has provided us with personally identifiable information, we will delete this information from our databases, subject to any technical limitations on our ability to do so.

9.0 Notification of Changes   
eSignal reserves the right to change or modify this Privacy Policy from time to time, or to terminate this Privacy Policy. We will post notice of the new policy from the Privacy Policy link on the homepage of our Website. Your use of our Website following any such change constitutes your agreement to follow and be bound by the Privacy Policy, as changed.
