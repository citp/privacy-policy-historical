      the operations of Estudents.com, we gather certain types of information 
      about Estudents.com users. This Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") explains 
      the types of information we gather, what we do with it and how you may 
      correct or change information that Estudents.com may collect. 
      </font></span></p>
      <p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: #ffffff; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Information 
      Collected by Estudents.com</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br><font color="#ffffff">Estudents.com collects two types of information about users: 
      personal information (such as name, e-mail address and demographic 
      information) and aggregate information (such as information about how many 
      users log on to our sites on a daily basis). </font></span></p>
      <p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: #ffffff; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Personal 
      Information</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br><font color="#ffffff">Personal information is collected when users voluntarily 
      register for membership services. These services include certain site 
      features, receiving electronic newsletters, receiving electronic 
      promotions or advertisements, using community and communication services, 
      answering surveys, purchasing items, and entering contests and other 
      promotional opportunities provided on our sites. We may collect personal 
      information from you in other areas of our sites, but we will provide 
      on-screen notification that we are doing so. We may receive personal usage 
      and demographic information from our third-party partners, and we also 
      collect e-mail addresses from users who send us support mail or request 
      technical or other help. This information enables Estudents.com to improve 
      our sites to make your online visits more productive and enjoyable. 
      </font></span></p>
      <p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: #ffffff; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Aggregate 
      Information</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br><font color="#ffffff">One 
      method of collecting aggregate information about your activities online 
      (such as the pages you access most frequently or the search terms you 
      enter), and information volunteered by you (such as survey or registration 
      information), is by tracking Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP 
      address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer 
      whenever you surf the Web. The computers that deliver the Web pages to you 
      automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When you request a 
      page from one of our sites, our servers log your IP address. Our sites 
      record IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to 
      provide aggregate data to advertisers about the volume of use on our 
      sites. We also create aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic 
      patterns for advertisers and partners. This allows these parties to 
      advertise more effectively, and allows you to receive advertisements that 
      are most relevant to your personal interests. An advertiser will not know 
      that you clicked its advertisement unless you voluntarily and explicitly 
      permit us to provide such information. </font></span></p>

      Information Collected by Estudents.com</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br><font color="#ffffff">Estudents.com uses the personal information we collect to 
      improve the content of our sites; to customize the content and/or layout 
      of our sites for each individual user; to notify users about updates to

      of interest to users; and to investigate violations of our terms and 
      conditions of use. </font></span></p>

      believes that membership has been used to commit unlawful acts, or acts 
      that may endanger the health or safety of another user or of the general 
      public. In some situations, we will share your personal information, on a 
      confidential basis, with third parties who perform a particular service on 
      our behalf, such as sending e-mails. These parties are not allowed to use 
      personal information except for the limited purpose of providing the 
      particular service on our behalf. In addition, Estudents.com may receive 
      personal usage and demographic information from third parties and uses 
      this information to improve our products and services. </font></span></p>
      <p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><font color="#ffffff">Occasionally, we may post the name of a user (for example, a

      possibility when you provide your information or, if possible, will notify 
      you when the information is posted. </font></span></p>

      including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about 
      your visits to our and other web sites in order to provide advertisements 
      about goods and services of interest to you. In addition, we share web 
      site usage information about visitors to our sites with such company for 
      the purpose of managing and targeting advertisements on our sites. For 
      this purpose, we and any third-party advertising company we may use, may 
      note some of the pages you visit on our sites through the use of pixel

      You will only receive a newsletter if you agree to receive it during 
      registration to one of the areas of our sites or directly from our 
      newsletter sign-up form. We will not divulge your membership in a
