			<h2>Online Advertising and Tracking</h2>
			<p>You may receive interest-based advertisements from us and from our ad providers that are specifically tailored to your interests. These ads have been selected based on your use of our website and services, information you provide to us, and/or other information obtained by us and our ad providers.  It is also possible that such interest-based advertising has been tailored to the interests that advertisers have inferred from your browsing of our websites, or from your use of other websites or applications with which a third-party has partnered, in order to provide advertising.</p>

			<p>We also may engage with third-party advertising networks. We share aggregate, but not personally identifiable information with these third parties, but ad networks may set and access their own cookies, beacons and similar technologies on your device and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you, including usage information, by tracking your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties. These ad networks may use the information they collect for their own purposes. We and our network advertisers may target advertisements for our products and services and those of our affiliates and subsidiaries on our website and on other websites you may visit.</p>

			<h2>Your Choices</h2>
			<p>We offer you certain choices about the information we collect, how we use and share information, and how we communicate with you. To help protect your privacy, when you exercise these choices we may take reasonable steps to verify your identity, such as requiring a password.</p>
			<p>By contacting us as shown in the Contact Us section of this Policy, you may opt out of receiving communications from us, such as emails and surveys.  You also have the following specific opt-out choices:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Marketing communications. You may opt out of specific communications (such as marketing emails) by following the opt-out instructions contained in the communication. </li>
				<li>Cookies. Most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies. However, rejecting cookies may affect your user experience, and you may not be able to access or use certain features of our sites. In addition, disabling cookies may invalidate opt outs that rely on cookies, such as targeted advertising opt outs. </li>
				<li>Targeted advertising. If you prefer to not receive targeted advertising, you can opt out of some network advertising programs that use your information. These network advertising programs may allow you to view and manage the interest categories they have compiled from your online browsing activities. These interest categories help determine the types of targeted advertisements you may receive.  To find out more, look for icons or other information displayed in the ads.</li>
				<li>Geographic location. When you use our website on your mobile device, you may choose not to share your location with us by adjusting the device’s location services settings. For instructions on changing the relevant settings, please contact your plan provider or device manufacturer.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>While we will take all reasonable steps to honor your choices with respect to your personal information, you should be aware that it is not always possible to delete all of your information for technical reasons. For example, we may store personal information in long-term archives or backups or retain an identifier to honor your opt out choices. We will continue to send you service-related communications, and we may need to keep the information we have collected about you for record keeping, analysis, or other reasons, to the extent permitted by law.</p>

			<p>If you are a California resident, you may contact us to request information about circumstances in which we share certain personal information with third parties for their marketing purposes. To request information, please contact us as indicated in the Contact Us section of this Policy.   Our website recognizes do-not-track signals sent by your browser.  Certain services that we offer through our website may not work correctly if your browser sends a do-not-track signal, and it may be necessary for you to adjust your settings in order to use those services.</p>
			
			<h2>Information Security</h2>
			<p>The nature of our business requires us to collect and maintain certain personal information, and we understand that we have a responsibility to protect it. To do so, we maintain appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards that are designed to safeguard your personal information from accidental, unlawful, or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure, or use. Your My Estes account is protected by your log-in credentials, which you must keep secure and confidential.</p>

			<p>We also offer you the option of interacting with the My Estes portion of our website and sharing and viewing information on a secure or unsecure platform.  When you opt to sign in to My Estes using the secure platform, the information you view and share is encrypted using SSL encryption. Encryption is the process of disguising information as data unintelligible to an unauthorized person. On the other hand, decryption or decipherment is the process of converting this ciphertext back into its original format. When used between you and Estes Express Lines, this technology encrypts your personal information as you send it to us so that only Estes Express Lines can decrypt it. When we send personal or account information to you, this technology encrypts it and only you have the capability to decrypt. We use the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) communications protocol when you log in to the My Estes portion of our website by opting to sign in “secure” mode. Please be advised that if you do not elect to sign in using the “secure” mode, your communications with and use of the My Estes portion of our website will not be secured with SSL encryption.</p>

			<p>Many of the services we provide on this website use access codes or passwords, which provide an additional layer of security for your information.  We communicate our privacy and security guidelines and standards to Estes employees who access personal information for purposes described in this policy, and we enforce these requirements within the company.</p>
			
			<h2>Accessing and Correcting Your Information</h2>
			<p>Estes endeavors to maintain accurate information and provide you with options to update your information. You can log into your account and modify your information using your log-in credentials. You also may request that we update your information by contacting us as described in the Contact Us section of this Policy.</p>

			<h2>International Data Transfer</h2>
			<p>Please be advised that information described in this policy will be maintained and processed in the United States.  Other countries, including the United States, may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you reside. No matter where we process personal information, that information will be subject to the policies and protections described by this Policy.</p>
			
			<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
			<p>We may provide links to other websites for your convenience and information. Since these sites are not owned, controlled, or operated by Estes, we cannot control how information collected by these linked sites will be used, shared, or secured. If you visit linked sites, we strongly suggest that you review the privacy notices or policies posted at those sites. We are not responsible for the content of linked sites, your use of them, or the information practices of their operators.</p>
			
			<h2>Contact Us</h2>
			<p>You may ask a question, request that we update your information, or submit a complaint by contacting us at:</p>

			<h2>Updates to Our Privacy Policy</h2>
			<p>As we modify our information collection or privacy practices, and as privacy laws evolve, it may be necessary to revise or update this Policy. We will always change the effective date on the Policy to reflect when it was last revised.
