To request information, please contact us as indicated in the Contact Us section of this Policy. Our website recognizes do-not-track signals sent by your browser. Certain services that we offer through our website may not work correctly if your browser sends a do-not-track signal, and it may be necessary for you to adjust your settings in order to use those services.

## Information Security

The nature of our business requires us to collect and maintain certain personal information, and we understand that we have a responsibility to protect it. To do so, we maintain appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards that are designed to safeguard your personal information from accidental, unlawful, or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure, or use. Your My Estes account is protected by your log-in credentials, which you must keep secure and confidential.

We also offer you the option of interacting with the My Estes portion of our website and sharing and viewing information on a secure or unsecure platform. When you opt to sign in to My Estes using the secure platform, the information you view and share is encrypted using SSL encryption. Encryption is the process of disguising information as data unintelligible to an unauthorized person. On the other hand, decryption or decipherment is the process of converting this ciphertext back into its original format. When used between you and Estes Express Lines, this technology encrypts your personal information as you send it to us so that only Estes Express Lines can decrypt it. When we send personal or account information to you, this technology encrypts it and only you have the capability to decrypt. We use the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) communications protocol when you log in to the My Estes portion of our website by opting to sign in “secure” mode. Please be advised that if you do not elect to sign in using the “secure” mode, your communications with and use of the My Estes portion of our website will not be secured with SSL encryption.

Many of the services we provide on this website use access codes or passwords, which provide an additional layer of security for your information. We communicate our privacy and security guidelines and standards to Estes employees who access personal information for purposes described in this policy, and we enforce these requirements within the company.

## Accessing and Correcting Your Information

Estes endeavors to maintain accurate information and provide you with options to update your information. You can log into your account and modify your information using your log-in credentials. You also may request that we update your information by contacting us as described in the Contact Us section of this Policy.

## International Data Transfer

Please be advised that information described in this policy will be maintained and processed in the United States. Other countries, including the United States, may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you reside. No matter where we process personal information, that information will be subject to the policies and protections described by this Policy.

## Links to Other Sites

We may provide links to other websites for your convenience and information. Since these sites are not owned, controlled, or operated by Estes, we cannot control how information collected by these linked sites will be used, shared, or secured. If you visit linked sites, we strongly suggest that you review the privacy notices or policies posted at those sites. We are not responsible for the content of linked sites, your use of them, or the information practices of their operators.
