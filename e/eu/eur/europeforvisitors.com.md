# Privacy Policy

ABOVE: We value your privacy, so please shut the door.

From:  [About Us](https://web.archive.org/web/20150612234642id_/http%3A//europeforvisitors.com/europe/articles/info/about_us.htm)

We have a very simple privacy policy:

  * We don't gather any personal information from you. Even if we somehow learn personal information about you (such as your e-mail address, if you write to us), we won't share that information with anyone else. We won't spam you with newsletters or e-mail sales pitches, either.


  * As a mom-and-pop operation owned by liberal-arts types, we don't even know _how_ to spy on you.



Notes: 

  * Although we don't gather any personal informaton, we aren't responsible for information that may be gathered by ad networks, affiliates, or advertisers when you complete surveys or fill out order forms. Nor are we responsible for any "cookies" that our advertising networks, booking partners, and traffic-measurement services may place in your "temporary Internet files" directory to keep track (for example) of whether you've previously visited the site, seen an ad, clicked an ad for a product or service, etc. And while we ourselves don't track IP addresses, which are the Internet Protocol numbers temporarily or permanently assigned to your network or computer by Internet service providers, third-party services such as Google and Quantcast may do so for purposes of traffic measuring and analysis.


  * When you visit a Web site (ours or anybody else's), the Web site's server logs indicate where you came from--e.g., "aol.com," "att.net," "harvard.edu," "fritolay.com," or "hkcable.com.hk." However, the server log doesn't indicate who you are (even if it records your IP address for tracking purposes) and we have no way of knowing your identity.


  * Finally, if you're paranoid about Web cookies, beacons, and similar temporary Internet files used by advertisers, you can disable them in your browser. (See your browser's help file to learn how.) Caution: Disabling or deleting cookies can have unintended consequences, such as forcing you to log in manually when you visit forums, social-networking sites, online editions of newspapers, and other membership-based sites.

Need a car in Europe?

If you live outside the EU, a tax-free [tourist car lease](https://web.archive.org/web/20150612234642id_/http%3A//europeforvisitors.com/europe/articles/short_term_car_leasing.htm) can be cheaper than renting for visits of 21+ days. Minimum driver age is 18, there' s no upper age limit, and rates include insurance.
