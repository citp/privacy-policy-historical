Personal data (such as your e-mail address) communicated by you shall be kept confidential. However, the EBU reserves the right to publish your name in relation to your Contribution (if the EBU so decides) and may contact you for a number of purposes related to the section of the Websites which you use.

Through appropriate technical and organisational procedures the EBU shall ensure that your personal data are protected against any non-authorised processing. In particular, the EBU shall make its best efforts to protect such data against the risk of accidental or unauthorised destruction, accidental loss, technical errors, falsification, theft or illegal use, modification, copying, and unauthorised access or other processing.

The EBU shall, moreover, make its best efforts to take all necessary measures to ensure the confidentiality of data communicated via the Internet.

For services proposed by a third party, via a link available on the Websites, the third party is solely responsible for collecting and processing personal data communicated by you. The EBU shall neither collect nor preserve the data thereby provided by you.

You have the right to ask for the details of your personal data to be corrected or deleted, by submitting to the EBU a signed and dated request by post, together with a copy of official proof of identity.
