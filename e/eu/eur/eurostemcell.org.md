# Privacy and Cookies | Eurostemcell

### **Our privacy policy**

####  **The information we collect about you, our security agreement and your rights.**  
The University of Edinburgh ( **the “University** ”, “us” or “we”) is committed to preserving your privacy. Please read the following privacy policy to understand how we use and protect the information obtained from those visiting and using the EuroStemCell website [www.eurostemcell.org](http://www.eurostemcell.org/) and its subdomains (the “website”). EuroStemCell does not engage in marketing or advertisement. The site has been developed in the public interest for the purpose of disseminating public information on stem cell research according to the [GDPR](https://www.eugdpr.org/).

###  **Your data       **

We want you to know exactly what will happen with your data if you use EuroStemCell.org or submit enquiries to EuroStemCell.org in accordance with the GDPR.

 **Information about you: how we use it and with whom we share it**   

The information you provide will be used by the EuroStemCell to deliver and improve the information we provide, to ensure that you receive relevant information, and to ensure that we use resources in the most efficient and effective way. Your information will be processed by the University to:

  * Provide you with relevant information on the condition or topic about which you have submitted an enquiry;


  * Analyse our ability to provide relevant public information on stem cell research.



We will not share, sell or distribute any of the information you provide to us without your consent, except where disclosure is:

  * necessary to enforce our rights, including under our website [Terms and Conditions](http://www.eurostemcell.org/terms-and-conditions) of use; or


  * required or permitted by law.



Authorised personnel within the University will be able to access the information you provide to us. Anonymised information may be provided to third parties for the purpose of improving the public information we provide.

 **If you opt-in to submitting an enquiry**

We only send response emails to people who asked for them directly through the enquiry contact form.  If you have opted-in to submit an enquiry, we will

  * retain your submission on our server within the University of Edinburgh for a period of 10 years unless you request your submission be deleted for the purpose of improving the information available in the public’s interest;


  * anonymise any submission if shared with a party outside the University of Edinburgh for the purpose of improving the information available in the public’s interest.



 **Using our websites and online services**

When you use our websites, we collect information where available about your IP address, operating system and browser type. This information is anonymised with the third party Google Analytics. This is data about users' browsing actions and patterns. It is used to inform improvements to the website, for system administration, and to report aggregate and anonymised information to third parties – such as the number of website visitors per month.

 **Contacting us**

When you email us at one of our email addresses – such as [enquiries@eurostemcell.org](mailto:enquiries@eurostemcell.org) \- we use a contact relationship management system to keep track of your communication with us. If we have an existing relationship, and your email is not confidential, we will automatically store the subject of the email and the name of the person in our department you were contacting.

This is done by the University and we do not give this data to any third parties or rely on any third party data processors for this function.

We do this to make sure that we answer questions and support requests in a timely manner, and to ensure that we use resources in the most efficient and effective way. We also use this information to follow our data retention schedule.

 **Our legal basis**

We are using information about you because you have given us your consent and any anonymised information collected is used in the public interest.

We use information about you related to your use of the website or requests for support because it is in the legitimate interest of the University. If we did not use your information we would not be able to provide effective and accurate public information, and it would be much harder to efficiently answer thousands of enquiry requests.

 **How long will we keep your data?**

We will hold the personal data you provided us in accordance with our data retention schedule. All information is stored anonymised for research purposes for a period of 10 years, or if you ask us to remove it. EuroStemCell does NOT share any personal information submitted through the enquiry form with third-parties and all information is secured on our server within the University of Edinburgh.

If you have any questions, or if you'd like your data to be deleted, please contact us: [enquiries@eurostemcell.org](mailto:enquiries@eurostemcell.org)

 **Security**

We employ security measures to protect your information from access by unauthorised persons and against unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction or damage. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to prevent unauthorised access. All information submitted via enquiry is stored on a private University of Edinburgh server for a period of 10 years.

###  **Your rights**

You have the right to ask for a copy of the information held by us in our records.  **EuroStemCell will never use your personal information for marketing or advertising purposes**. You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for research purposes.  We will inform you (before collecting your personal data) if we intend to use your personal data for such purposes.  You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your personal data.  You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us at [enquries@eurostemcell.org](mailto:enquries@eurostemcell.org)

The website may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of third parties. If you follow a link to any of these websites, _please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies._  Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these third party websites.

 **Contact Us**
