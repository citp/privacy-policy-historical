## EuroVPS Content Responsibility

EuroVPS cannot monitor, verify, warrant, or vouch for the accuracy and quality of the information that subscribers may acquire. For this reason, the subscriber must exercise his or her best judgment in relying on information obtained from the Internet, and also should be aware that some material posted to the Internet is sexually explicit or otherwise offensive. Because EuroVPS cannot monitor or censor the Internet, and will not attempt to do so, EuroVPS cannot accept any responsibility for injury to its subscribers that results from inaccurate, unsuitable, offensive, or illegal Internet communications.

## Limitations of EuroVPS

EuroVPS does not review, edit, censor, or take responsibility for any information its subscribers may create. When users place information on the Internet, they have the same liability as other authors for copyright infringement, defamation, and other harmful speech. Subscribers' postings to the Internet may affect other subscribers and may harm EuroVPS's goodwill, business reputation, and operations. For these reasons, subscribers violate EuroVPS policy and the service agreement when they, their customers, affiliates, or subsidiaries engage in the any prohibited activities.

## EuroVPS Intervention

EuroVPS will not, as an ordinary practice, monitor the communications of its subscribers to ensure that they comply with EuroVPS policy or applicable law. When EuroVPS becomes aware of harmful activities, however, it may take any action to stop the harmful activity, including but not limited to, removing information, shutting down a web site, implementing screening software designed to block offending transmissions, denying access to the Internet, or take any other action it deems appropriate.
