# EUROPAGES privacy policy | Europages

EUROPAGES recognises the importance that must be given to protecting personal data.

Our Privacy Policy applies to all members and visitors. We collect data when you use our services so that we can offer you a personalised and relevant experience, including growing your network and enabling your business opportunities.

The rules outlined below apply to all services offered by EUROPAGES on all the different language versions of the www.europages.com website.

In order to offer the best possible protection of data concerning an identified or identifiable person collected on the europages.com website, EUROPAGES applies a strict policy for protecting personal data, including enforcing high security standards for the products and services offered directly on the europages.com website.

## 1\. Gathering your personal data

 **1.1** The company EUROPAGES SA is responsible for processing the data.

The EUROPAGES website does not ask its Users for name-specific registration when they are simply visiting its services.  
When browsing the www.europages.com website, certain personal data is automatically generated.  
This electronic identification data comprises:

  * connection data: the IP address of the User’s computer, the type and version of browser programme, the URL address visited and the version consulted;
  * usage data: keywords types, search(es) carried out, sectors, fields and headings selected.



 **1.2**  Other personal data may be communicated voluntarily by the User to EUROPAGES.

This concerns:

  * data used to fill in online forms;
  * data provided to receive alerts;
  * data communicated during online surveys.



 **1.3** Creating an account and online subscriptions

To create a EUROPAGES account, you have to tell us your last name and email address and agree to our Terms and Conditions of Use and this Privacy Policy, which governs the way in which we process your personal data.

By providing us with personal data when you create or modify your account and your profile, you expressly and voluntarily agree to our Terms and Conditions of Use and freely consent to our processing of your personal data in compliance with the terms described in this Privacy Policy. Providing us with any information deemed ‘sensitive’ by applicable law is entirely voluntary on your part.

If you have any reservations about providing information to us or having such information displayed on our services or otherwise used in any manner permitted in this Privacy Policy and the Terms and Conditions of Use, you should not become a member and should cease to visit our websites.

 **1.4** Activity and session information

We may be led to store data concerning your use of our services, such as your searches, the pages you visit, the data and time of your visit and the companies you contact on the EUROPAGES website.

We may also store data concerning your use of our services as provided by your computer or mobile device. This information concerns, for example, your browser language, IP address, mobile operator, unique device identifier and geographical position (including geolocation, beacon location and GPS location), as well as the URLs requested and reference URLs.

You may be able to block our use of certain data using the parameters of your device or browser.

 **1.5** Communications

When you sign up for an account or to use certain functions, you choose or agree by default to receive messages from other EUROPAGES users, companies and the EUROPAGES site itself.

Members can send requests for information to the companies listed on the site. If you choose to send a request for information using the contact forms on the EUROPAGES website, your personal data, including your email address and any other information you provide, will be visible to the company contacted.

In additional, these messages may be stored, processed or transferred by our servers.

We use them anonymously in the activity feed for our members available on the home page.

This means that part of these messages may appear on the home pages of the different language versions.

Requests for information made using the EUROPAGES system are available for consultation by the member initially addressed and by our customer service employees, who may communicate information on such requests to members or any other person. When required, we may view messages sent via our platform. We may also occasionally use third-party email servers to send and monitor the reception of messages containing requests for information and analyse the usage patterns provided by third-party monitoring systems.

If you represent a company listed on EUROPAGES, we may contact you, including by telephone or email, using the details that you provide us with, that you make publicly accessible or that we have recorded for your establishment.
