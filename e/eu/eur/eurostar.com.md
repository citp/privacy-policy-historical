We can only use your personal data if we have a proper reason for doing so. According to the law, we can only use your data for one or more of these reasons:

Legitimate interests are our business or commercial reasons for using your data, but we will not unfairly put our legitimate interests above what is best for you.  Examples of legitimate interests we may rely on to process your data include developing products and services, identifying ways to improve the way we deliver services to our customers, and being efficient about how we conduct our business operations and fulfil our legal duties.
