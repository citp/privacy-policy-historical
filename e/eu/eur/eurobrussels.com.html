<h2>1.2 Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h2>
<p>EuroJobsites and our third-party partners, such as our advertising and analytics partners, use cookies and other tracking technologies to provide functionality and to recognize you across different Services and devices.</p>
<h1>2 Personal data you provide to us on a voluntary basis and what we use it for</h1>
<h2>2.1 Newsletter and Job Alerts</h2>
<p>We store your email address if you subscribe to one of our newsletters. If you subscribe to Job Alerts, we store your email address and the selection of categories and countries you have selected to receive Job Alerts for. Your email address and other information will only be used for sending you our newsletter and/or Job Alerts and will not be passed to any other company.</p>
<h2>2.2 Job Applications through EuroJobsites website forms</h2>
<p>For some jobs you may be applying by entering information into a website form on a EuroJobsites job-board. In these cases the recruiting organisation (the Recruiter) has requested that EuroJobsites collects your application data in EuroJobsites’ Applicant Tracker System.</p>
<p>EuroJobsites holds all answers and documents from a Job Application for the sole use of the Recruiter. Once the Recruiter informs EuroJobsites the recruitment has been completed, EuroJobsites will remove or anonymise all personal data from the job application from EuroJobsites systems.</p>
<p>EuroJobsites will not use your personal data supplied in the job application for any purpose except to enable the Recruiter to receive it or manage it for their recruitment.</p>
<h2>2.3 CV database</h2>
<p>As a job seeker, you can submit your CV and other personal data to EuroJobsites for posting on our Site and storage in our CV database. The personal data that you submit will only be used for recruitment purposes, which include EuroJobsites and recruiters evaluating and contacting you regarding your interest in employment, and forwarding your candidature to potential recruiters.</p>
<h2>2.4 Social Media</h2>
<p>If you interact with EuroJobsites on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter EuroJobsites may obtain information about you. The information we receive will depend on the privacy preferences you have set on those types of platforms.</p>
<h2>2.5 Login</h2>
<p>If you create a Job Alert you may use a password to login, which we store securely in encrypted form. If you login using Google or Facebook we simply confirm with them that you are also currently also logged in with them using the email address you provided and this then proves your identity.</p>
<h2>2.6 Your emails to us</h2>
<p>Emails to us from jobseekers, candidates or clients are held in a cloud based email management system. Emails from candidates or jobseekers to us and replies are retained until we have concluded the conversation, then the email is removed within 1 month. Emails to or from clients (usually regarding sales or job postings) are retained for a maximum of 10 years from the last contact.</p>
<h1>3 How we share information</h1>
<h2>3.1 General information</h2>
<p>EuroJobsites do not sell, rent, trade or otherwise disclose personal data about our Site visitors, except as described here. <br>When you provide EuroJobsites with personal data through this Site, you authorise EuroJobsites to use that personal data for the indicated purposes.</p>
<h2>3.2 CV database profile</h2>
<p>When you upload your personal data to the CV Database you authorise us to use that personal data for the purposes described in our CV Terms Of Use.</p>
<p>EuroJobsites operatives, agents or subcontractors, will use this for recruitment purposes, which include evaluating and contacting you regarding your interest in employment, and forwarding your candidature to potential recruiters.</p>
<p>We may share your personal data with potential recruiters. Recruiters will have access to our candidates database remotely. We contractually require the potential recruiters to keep the data secure and not to use them for other purposes than recruitment purposes. Once contacted by a potential recruiter, please see their privacy policy for more information about their privacy practices.</p>
<p>Additionally, we may provide these potential recruiters with aggregated information (generic information on users of our services) about the performance of the Site such as the number of visitors, their country of residence, age, gender and language preferences.</p>
<h2>3.3 EuroJobsites aim to store candidate personal data in the EU</h2>
<p>Personal candidate information held by EuroJobsites is generally stored within the EU. Therefore EuroJobsites websites, servers running websites and databases are located within the EU. EuroJobsites Newsletter, Job Alerts, Job Application and CV database systems hold your personal data on databases and servers within the EU.</p>
<h2>3.4 Service providers not located in the EU</h2>
<p>For a few services, mainly for handling client, sales and analytics information, EuroJobsites use US companies which may process your information outside the EU. <br>If you send emails to EuroJobsites this is read and managed using a system provided by a US based supplier. EuroJobsites may also store some personal data in Google Analytics, Google Docs, Google Drive or Dropbox, which are US based suppliers.<br>These service providers all&nbsp;participate in and certify their compliance with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, which means these Suppliers undertake to make sure that the privacy rights of EU individuals can be exercised when their data are being processed in the United States including safeguards on US government access to data.</p>
<h2>3.5 Recruiters from outside the EU may advertise jobs</h2>
<p>Some recruiters advertising jobs on our websites or emails may have some operations outside of the EU. Therefore if you apply for a job some of your personal data may leave the EU, even if the job is located inside the EU. Please consult the recruiter’s privacy policy for more details before applying.</p>
<h2>3.6 Recruiters from outside the EU may use the CV database</h2>
<p>If you upload your personal details to the CV database your data may be viewed and your CV downloaded by a recruiter outside the EU.</p>
<h2>3.7 Third parties suppliers and subcontractors</h2>
<p>EuroJobsites uses third parties and subcontractors to perform services such as email services, analytics, server hosting, and data processing. These third parties and subcontractors are subject to strict data processing terms and conditions and are contractually prohibited from utilising, sharing or retaining your personal data for any purpose other than as they have been specifically contracted for (or without your consent).</p>
<h1>4 How to access and control your information</h1>
