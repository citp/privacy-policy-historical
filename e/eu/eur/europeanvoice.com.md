If you do not wish to receive information about our products or services or information from other organisations about products or services offered by them, please tick the appropriate box on the registration or order form. However, we may disclose your information to business partners and third party suppliers we engage to provide services which involve processing data on our behalf.

User information is retained for in-house research to:

  * improve our understanding of customer needs and product development

If you are keen to be kept informed about other European Voice products as well as technical/functional developments related to our website and on-line services then you should tick the e-mail opt-in box.

You may also indicate whether you wish to receive such information from other Economist Group businesses.

We may occasionally allow other similar but reputable organisations which may be of interest to contact you. If you don’t wish to hear from these companies, please tick the appropriate box on the order/registration form to opt out of such activity.

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a small file which is placed on the user's hard drive during an EuropeanVoice.com visit. This file allows the user to move quickly and easily around our site. It is used to identify returning users and to identify subscribers and registrants (a registrant - and subscriber - will have the cookie linked to their e-mail address as a way of identifying them). This means that if you are a registrant or subscriber, you will not have to login each time you visit. We also use a cookie to track a user's sessions. We use this information to find out what site features are most popular so that we can develop EuropeanVoice.com in the light of our analysis of people's usage. We may also use cookies and the information we collect to show you relevant content and advertising. You can delete cookies from your hard drive at any time. Bear in mind, though, that if you delete these cookies, any settings such as your stored username and password will have to be reset when you log in again.
