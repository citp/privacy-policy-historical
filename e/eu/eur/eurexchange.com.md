# Eurex Exchange - Privacy policy

Eurex Frankfurt AG appreciates the importance of personal data. As with all our business processes, the protection of your privacy when processing personal data is an important concern to which we pay special attention. Personal data are collected, processed and used in accordance with those national data protection regulations of the country in which the responsible company (data controller) is located. We therefore wish to provide you with information as to which of your personal data we collect and for which purposes these data shall be used with this document.

The privacy/data protection information in the following Section A refer to your use of our App, while the privacy/data protection information in the following Section B refer to your use of our internet pages. The following Section C contains joint regulations related to the use of our App and our Internet pages.

Since amendments of the law may require the adjustment of this privacy/data protection information, we would ask you to consult this privacy/data protection information at regular intervals. This privacy/data protection information is accessible to you at any time on the App and on our internet pages.

According to the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG), personal data is defined as information that may be used to draw conclusions in respect to your person, i.e. information on your personal situation or factual/material circumstances.

  
Section A: Privacy/Data Protection Information concerning the utilisation of our App

  
1\. Data collection and processing

You shall be able to use a large part of our App services without having to disclose your identity, i.e. without us collecting any of your personal data. However, if you register for our personalized services - Watchlist or Alerts - we shall ask you for your e-mail address and for the specification of a password to be determined by you. Mandatory fields that need to be filled out and completed correspondingly will be clearly marked, making it transparent for you at all times which data you are required to enter and which of these will be stored in order to use the services Watchlist or Alerts. Following the completion of your registration, we will send you a confirmation e-mail. Only after your confirmation of this e-mail will we use and process the data you provided; otherwise, the respective data will be deleted again after a short period of time. If you wish to unsubscribe to this service at a later point in time, your personal data will be deleted again. Eurex Frankfurt AG will not transfer any of your data to non-EU countries without your explicit consent. We shall only collect your IP address in a shortened form (including during the registration process), so that it will not be possible to relate this address to you personally.

In association with the retrieval of information requested by you, data will be stored on our servers - following your registration for Watchlist or Alerts - to provide the respective services (especially for storing offers/services marked by you as interesting), which possibly may permit personal identification (such as date, time, pages visited and the IP address in shortened form). This information will be deleted, provided its storage is no longer required.

Any evaluation of your personal user behaviour will not take place in relation to the App. The right to statistical evaluation of pseudonymized or anonymized data relating to your user behaviour shall remain reserved. Such information may be stored for system safety reasons (for the prevention of abuse) in the case of IP logs, for purposes of enhancing the services offered and for statistical purposes (number of users and page retrievals). You are entitled to object to any pseudonymous profiling in respect to your user behaviour (please refer to the possibility to file an objection, Section C no. 3 below).

Any processing and use of personal data in relation to your user behaviour will only take place if you have explicitly agreed to this type of utilization. For this, we would obtain your consent separately for any such purpose outside of this Privacy Policy. Without such consent, your data will not be used, for instance for advertising purposes.

Should we obtain the separate consent from you, you are entitled to withdraw this consent at any time by sending an e-mail to info@eurexchange.com. In the event of this case the respective service offered may no longer be available.

We also do not create any personal user profiles. General information such as when which page was retrieved or which page was visited most frequently will be logged. However, this data does not enable any conclusions about the user, rather they are stored anonymously or under a pseudonym unless you object to this procedure (please refer to Section C no. 3). A merger of data regarding the bearer of a pseudonym will not take place.

  
3\. Transfer of data to third parties

Due to statutory requirements, we shall be entitled to transfer your personal data to third parties in certain cases. This will be the case, for instance, if there is a suspicion of a criminal offence or the abuse of our services offered in this App. In this event, we shall be entitled to transfer your personal data to the criminal prosecution authority. Otherwise, your personal data will be stored exclusively in our database and on our servers, or on those of our commissioned data processing providers, unless you were notified that the respective personal data is shared with other companies such as cooperation or advertising partners on condition that you explicitly agreed to such transfers of your personal data.
