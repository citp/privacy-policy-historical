"That Topshot online slot very nice. I like it very much that I can also play for free. I almost can't keep my hands off it. Made wonderfully, my compliments" 

"Perfect service! My PC crashed and I thought 'credits're gone'. But when I restarted my PC and opened the game again, all my credits were back where they belong to" 

"Thanks for the fast payout of my won prize. I doubted somewhat whether it'd all be trustworthy, but the amount was on my account the next day. I will surely be back sometime to play your slot machines again." 

"I used to play these kind of slots in the pub in the old days. But since I am bound to be at home most of my time because of a serious accident, that fun is a past time. Your Clubgold slot game looks and plays almost like the real one. I have won several times already and always receive my money in time. Thanks!" 

_(continued conversation)_ "I received the credits after all. After rebooting my PC the lost credits were added extra. Thanks once again for the quick response"

This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.



Where we store your personal data

  * Primarily, the data we collect from you will be stored on servers in Europe. However, the data that we collect from you will be transferred to third parties as mentioned in earlier parts of this policy and such data will therefore be stored by them. Some of the third parties that we share data with may have their servers at a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It will also be processed by staff or company representatives operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. This includes staff engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy and that the persons we are sharing data with employ similar organisational and technical measures as us. When personal data is transferred outside the EEA we will seek to take additional steps such as entering into EU compliant data transfer agreements with the data importer where necessary.
  * All information you provide to us is stored on secure servers.
  * Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology.
  * Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.



### Your rights

Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data.

  * _Request access to your personal data._ You have the right to access information held about you. Some of the personal data held about you can be accessed by logging into your account. Additional information may be requested by contacting us on [support@simbat.com](mailto:support@simbat.com). We shall comply with any reasonable access request. In the events that the access request involves a disproportionate amount of work, we reserve the right, in line with applicable law, to charge a fee covering the work involved.
  * _Request correction of your personal data._ This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
  * _Request erasure of your personal data._ You have the right to ask us to delete any information we hold about you which is not relevant to purpose for which we collect it. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You may also request for us to delete all your personal data, in which case we ask you to close your account. There may be legal obligations which may prohibit us from deleting all or any information held about you immediately at the time of the request (such as Anti-Money Laundering legislation), however we will process your request at the earliest opportunity whenever any applicable data retention period expires.
  * _Object to processing of your personal data._ You have a right to object to our processing of personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes on ground of legitimate interest. You may also object to us showing you targeted ads on our site, in which case you will not see any less ads but you will see ads that are less relevant to your interests. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
  * _Request restriction of processing your personal data._ This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; or (b) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it; or (c) where you contest that our use of your personal data is unlawful.
  * _Request transfer of your personal data_  (data portability request). This enables you to request your personal data. We will provide to you, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
  * _Right to unsubscribe from direct marketing. You have the right at any time to change your mind in relation to us being able to contact you with direct marketing. You can exercise your right to stop receiving direct marketing by accessing your account and unticking the boxe(s) related to direct marketing or by contacting customer support. You may also unsubscribe by following the unsubscribe instructions on the communication itself._
  * _Your updated preferences will be applied immediately though please allow up to 48 hours for any changes you make to your marketing preferences to be fully processed. Please remember that even if you opt out of receiving marketing emails, we may still send you important Service information related to your accounts and subscriptions._
  * _Right to withdraw consent. In cases where we rely on your consent for the processing of personal data, you have a right to withdraw your consent at any time._
  * We will retain copies of any communications that you send to us (including copies of any emails) in order to maintain accurate records of the information that we have received from you.
  * You can also exercise your rights at any time by contacting us at [support@simbat.com](mailto:support@simbat.com). All communications with us must be through the e-mail address that is associated with your account. We will verify your identity prior to responding to any request.



### Time Limit to Respond

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

### Data Security

We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

### Data Retention

By law we have to keep basic information about you including Contact, Identity, KYC, Financial and Transaction Data for five years after you close an account with us, or any longer time period required by the law of any jurisdiction.

You can ask us to delete your data by closing your account. In that case, we will immediately delete all information aside from that which we are required to maintain to fulfil our legal obligations as indicated above.

In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

### Cookies notice

Our website uses cookies. A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we put on your computer. These cookies allow us to distinguish you from other users of our website, which helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website and also allows us to improve our site.

You may modify the settings in most browsers to notify you when you receive a new cookie and disable cookies altogether. For more information on Cookies, please refer to our [Cookies Policy](https://web.archive.org/cookies.php).

### Advertising on Third Party Sites

We use third parties who collect data about their apps' and sites' visitors through their own cookies, web beacons, and other technologies regarding your online activities, in an effort to understand your interests and deliver you advertisements that are tailored to your interests. We may purchase ad space on third party sites and our ads may appear when the third party determines that our ad is relevant to your interest according to the information they have collected.

We do not provide any personal information to advertisers or to third party sites that display our interest-based ads, however they may have collected certain personal information from you through the use of their site (such as articles read, types of ads clicked etc.), or through data analytics platforms (such as Google Analytics) and they may therefore customise advertising material published on their site according to your interests.

Third party advertisers or advertising companies working on their behalf sometimes use technology to serve our advertisements. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalise advertising content.

We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features that advertisers and third party sites may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third party websites are not covered by our Privacy Policy. Please contact them directly for more information about their privacy practices.

### Changes to our privacy policy

  * Any changes we make to our privacy policy in the future will be posted on this page and, where appropriate, notified to you by e-mail.

 _President Bill Clinton, commenting on his mothers visit to Las Vegas four days before she died_
