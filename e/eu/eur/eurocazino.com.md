"That Topshot online slot very nice. I like it very much that I can also play for free. I almost can't keep my hands off it. Made wonderfully, my compliments" 

"Perfect service! My PC crashed and I thought 'credits're gone'. But when I restarted my PC and opened the game again, all my credits were back where they belong to" 

"Thanks for the fast payout of my won prize. I doubted somewhat whether it'd all be trustworthy, but the amount was on my account the next day. I will surely be back sometime to play your slot machines again." 

"I used to play these kind of slots in the pub in the old days. But since I am bound to be at home most of my time because of a serious accident, that fun is a past time. Your Clubgold slot game looks and plays almost like the real one. I have won several times already and always receive my money in time. Thanks!" 

_(continued conversation)_ "I received the credits after all. After rebooting my PC the lost credits were added extra. Thanks once again for the quick response"

"The typical gambler might not really understand the probabilistic nuances of the wheel or the dice, but such things seem a bit more tractable than, say, trying to raise a child in this lunatic society of ours."  
 _Arthur S. Reber, The New Gambler 's Bible_

"She got to go to heaven four days early."  
 _President Bill Clinton, commenting on his mothers visit to Las Vegas four days before she died_

"A dollar picked up in the road is more satisfaction to us than the 99 which we had to work for, and the money won at Faro or in the stock market snuggles into our hearts in the same way."  
 _Mark Twain_
