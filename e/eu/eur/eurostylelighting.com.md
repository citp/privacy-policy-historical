##  Privacy and Security

**Our Privacy Policy**

We respect the privacy of our customers. This page is intended to help you understand our policies and how we use information about you. As we change our site or add new functionality this policy may change and we will post any revisions on this site. When you do business with us or this website, you accept this Privacy Policy.

You can visit our site without ever telling us who you are. We may track the Internet domain address from which you visit us and look at this data for user trends and statistics, but you remain anonymous unless you engage in an activity that tells us who you are.

You tell us about yourself in several ways. When you purchase a product from us, register for a service or participate in a promotion, we collect and store your personal and transactional information in our customer database. This information is generally used to process your transactions and respond to your requests. You may also sign-up to receive periodic email communication from us about new promotions, products or special events. By purchasing from us you will receive these promotional emails, and you will also receive emails about your order processing and shipping.

Aggregate information may be created from the combined information you give us online, including personal information about you and/or your order. We may combine that information with publicly available information and private information we receive from or cross-reference with our Select Partners and other persons or companies whom we have deemed to be trustworthy and responsible and whose privacy policies are aligned with ours. We use that combined information to enhance and personalize your shopping experience with us, to communicate with you about our products and events that may be of interest to you, and that will allow Select Partners and other persons or companies to contact you regarding products and/or services that may be of interest to you. If you prefer that we do not share your name and address with other marketers, please email us at [opt-out@eurostylelighting.com](mailto:opt-out@eurostylelighting.com). To opt out of our emails, please visit our [email page](https://secure.eurostylelighting.com/protected/contactus/email) and submit your email address or call us with your request at **877-233-7095.**

We do reserve the right to disclose your personal information when we have reason to believe that it is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against persons or entities that may be causing injury to you, EuroStyleLighting.com or to others. We may also disclose personal information when we believe the law requires it.

EuroStyleLighting.com, like most other online retailers, uses "cookies" to enhance your online shopping experience with us. A cookie is a small bit of data sent to your browser and stored on your computer's hard drive that we use to help us retrieve any information you may have stored with us. If you use our "Wish List" function, for example, a cookie will help retrieve a list you created at an earlier date.

Acceptance of cookies is not a requirement to browse our site, however our shopping cart does require the acceptance of cookies to work properly. Cookies are never used to store sensitive customer information such as names, addresses, passwords or credit card numbers. If you would like to place an order on our site but object to or otherwise are unable to use cookies, please feel free to place your order seven days a week by calling our toll free number: **877-233-7095**.

**Our Email Policy**

We do not sell, rent or share email addresses with any third parties. If you purchase from us or join our email list, we may occasionally send you an email about a special event or sale. Instructions on how to unsubsrcibe from our list are included in every promotional email we send out. You may also unsubscribe by [clicking here](https://secure.eurostylelighting.com/protected/contactus/email) and submitting your email on our email page, or by calling us with your request at **877-233-7095**.

If you choose to unsubscribe, EuroStyleLighting.com, in compliance with the CAN-SPAM legislation, will remove your address from our list. In the majority of cases your address will be removed within 5 business days, but it can take up to 10 business days in some instances. Also under the terms of the CAN-SPAM act, we may occasionally supply a list of "opt-out", removed email addresses to our advertising partners. This is done to ensure that those removed email addresses do not receive new advertising offers from us through our advertising partners. 

In addition, when we join with another company to offer or provide services, products, sweepstakes, contests or promotions, we and the other company may cross-reference our customer databases to identify common customers. We and the other company may use that existing information to identify future promotional opportunities and to fulfill promotional or contractual obligations. When we offer contests and promotions, or join with other companies to do so, customers who choose to participate in those contests and promotions may be asked to provide personal information to participate. That information may then be used by us and any company offering the contest or promotion to notify winners or to fulfill promotional obligations.

**Safe and Secure Shopping**

We guarantee that every transaction you make at EuroStyleLighting.com will be secure. Each online transaction is protected by SSL (Secure Socket Layer) industry-standard security up to high-grade 256-bit encryption.

SSL encrypts information sent from your browser to us and is the standard for creating a secure, encrypted link between a Web server and a shopper's browser. SSL ensures safe passage of sensitive information, such as credit card numbers, passwords and user names. 

Your credit card information and other data is fully encrypted while traveling the Internet. This process makes it statistically much safer to shop with us than to use your card in a restaurant or store. This encryption applies to users viewing our site using Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 or higher, Netscape Navigator 2.0 or higher, or America Online 3.0 or higher. Your transaction is secure when a "complete key" icon appears in the lower left-hand corner of your Netscape Navigator screen, or a "closed lock" icon appears in the lower right-hand corner of your Internet Explorer screen.

Should any unauthorized charges ever be made to your card as a result of shopping here, you would pay nothing. Per the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50 of fraudulent charges. We will cover the $50 if the unauthorized use of your credit card results from a purchase made through our site while using our secure server. Remember to notify your credit provider in accordance to the reporting rules and procedures listed in your account agreement.
