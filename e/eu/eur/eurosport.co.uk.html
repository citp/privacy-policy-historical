	<h2>WHAT THIS PRIVACY AND COOKIE POLICY COVERS</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy covers Yahoo!'s treatment of personal information that Yahoo! collects and receives, including information related to your past use of Yahoo! products and services. Personal information includes information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available. </p>

<p>The Privacy Policy also gives information about cookies; Yahoo!'s and third parties' use of cookies; and how you may disable such cookies. </p>

<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Yahoo! does not own or control, or to people that Yahoo! does not employ or manage. In addition, some companies that Yahoo! has acquired have their own, preexisting privacy policies which may be viewed on our <a href="http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/us/yahoo/acquiredcompanies/" class="bb-url">acquired companies page</a>.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy incorporates, where applicable, any additional guidance about our privacy practices relating to particular products or services that can be found under the section "More about Yahoo! Privacy" on the top left of this page. </p>

<p>Yahoo!” means Yahoo! SARL (based in Switzerland), except where the relevant service is provided by another Yahoo! group company, in which case references to Yahoo! shall, in respect of those services, be references to that Yahoo! Group company. Find out more information about Yahoo! <a href="http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/uk/yahoo/datastorage/" class="bb-url">data storage</a> and <a href="http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/uk/yahoo/datatransfer/" class="bb-url">data transfer</a>.</p>

	<h2>INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</h2>
<p>Yahoo! collects personal information when you register for a Yahoo! account, when you use certain Yahoo! <a href="http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/uk/all/" class="bb-url">products or services</a>, when you enter <a href="http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/uk/yahoo/promotions/" class="bb-url">promotions or sweepstakes</a> and when you visit Yahoo! pages or the pages of certain Yahoo! partners outside the branded Yahoo! network of websites. Yahoo! may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies. </p>

<p>When you register with Yahoo!, we ask for your name, email address, birth date, gender, post code, occupation, industry, and personal interests. Once you register with Yahoo! and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. </p>

<p>Yahoo! collects information about your transactions with us and with some of our business partners, including information about your use of financial products and services that we offer.</p>

<p>Yahoo! also automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your <a href="http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/uk/yahoo/ip" class="bb-url">IP address</a>, Yahoo! <a href="http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/uk/yahoo/cookies" class="bb-url">cookie</a> information, software and hardware attributes, and the page you requested. </p>

<a name="use"></a><p> Yahoo! uses information for the following general purposes: to personalise the advertising and content you see, based on the details given by you at registration and your activity at Yahoo!, fulfil your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients. You agree that Yahoo! may transfer your personal information for the general purposes set out above to any Yahoo! group company worldwide.<br><br>

	<h2>INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE</h2>
 <p>Yahoo! does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul class="bb-list">
<li>We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Yahoo! under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help Yahoo! communicate with you about offers from Yahoo! and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information. </li>
<li>We respond to subpoenas, court orders, legal process, or to any legitimate request by authorities with which we must comply. </li>
<li>We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Yahoo!'s terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.</li>
<li>This is within the Yahoo! group, for the purposes described under “Information Collection &amp; Use” above (for example, various companies in the Yahoo! group are responsible for storing and processing your information in order to deliver content to you). </li>
<li>Yahoo! may transfer information about you if Yahoo! acquires, or is acquired by or merged with, another company. In this event, Yahoo! will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. </li></ul>
<p>Yahoo! displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteria—for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area. </p>
<ul class="bb-list">
<li>Yahoo! does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad. </li>
<li>Yahoo! advertisers include financial service providers (such as banks, insurance agents, stock brokers and mortgage lenders) and non-financial companies (such as stores, airlines, and software companies). </li> </ul>

<p>Yahoo! works with vendors, partners, advertisers, and other service providers in different industries and categories of business. For more information regarding providers of products or services that you've requested please read our detailed <a href="http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/uk/all" class="bb-url"> reference links</a>. </p>
