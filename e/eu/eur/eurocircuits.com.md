This information is used to better understand and improve the usability, performance, and effectiveness of the website. Please read the “Cookies” section below for more information.

We only provide these third parties with the minimum amount of Personal Information necessary to complete the requested service or transaction, and the third parties are not permitted to use your Personal Information except for limited purpose of completing the requested service or transaction. We may respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process by disclosing your Personal Information and other related information, if necessary.

While navigating Eurocircuits’ web site you may be directed to content or functionality that is hosted by a third-party supplier, not on eurocircuits.com. This is typically done to host special events, such as contests or to organize online payments. When information is collected on behalf of Eurocircuits exclusively, Eurocircuits’ privacy policy will be referenced on the site and will govern how your information is used. For other, non-Eurocircuits sites, the site owner’s privacy policy will be referenced. It is Eurocircuits’ practice to require such suppliers to handle information in a manner consistent with Eurocircuits’ privacy and security policies.

We will ask for your consent before we use or share your information for any purpose other than the reason you provided it or as otherwise provided by this policy.

Eurocircuits is committed to protecting the Personal Information you share with us. We utilize a combination of industrystandard security technologies, procedures, and organizational measures to help protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.

When we transfer sensitive personal data (for example, credit card information) over the Internet, we protect it using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology. While we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure the security of the information you transmit.

We recommend you to take every precaution in protecting your Personal Information when you are on the Internet. For example, change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers when creating passwords, and make sure you use a secure browser. Please visit the Linksys website for more tips for using security features when connected  
to the Internet using a router.

Like many websites, Eurocircuits uses technologies, such as cookies and web beacons, which allow us to make your visit to our website easier, more efficient and more valuable by providing you with a customized experience and recognizing you when you return.

A cookie cannot read personal data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites; indeed, the only Personal Information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. Accepting the cookies used on our website may give us access to information about your browsing behavior, which we may use to personalize your experience and track user traffic patterns, and to merge this info when you register. We do this in order to determine the usefulness of our website information to our users and to see how effective our navigational structure is in helping users reach that information. You may browse most of Eurocircuits’ website without accepting cookies from Eurocircuits; however, some website functionality may be lost by disabling cookies on your computer. Other Eurocircuits web pages, particularly those which require a login and password, require cookies and cannot be used when you have disabled cookies in your browser. In addition, Eurocircuits uses web beacons in conjunction with cookies to understand user behavior. Web beacons are simply a convenient way of gathering basic statistics and managing cookies, and do not give away any extra information from your computer. Turning off your browser’s cookies will prevent web beacons from tracking your specific activity.

If you prefer not to receive cookies while browsing our website or via HTML-formatted emails, you can set your browser to warn you before it accepts cookies or refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser.

Eurocircuits will not retain your Personal Information longer than is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or as required by applicable laws or regulations.

Our websites may provide links to other third-party websites which are outside our control and not covered by this policy.  
We encourage you to review the privacy policies posted on these (and all) sites you visit.

If you participate in a Eurocircuits discussion forum or chat room or blog discussion, you should be aware that the information you provide there will be made broadly available to others, potentially inside or outside Eurocircuits, who have access to that discussion forum or chat room. Also, please recognize that individual forums and chat rooms may have additional rules and conditions. Each participant’s opinion on a forum or chat room is his or her own and should not be considered as reflecting the opinion of Eurocircuits

Eurocircuits does not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected Personal Information on a child under the age of 13, we will delete that data from our systems. Eurocircuits encourages parents and guardians to go online with their children. Here are a few tips to help make a child’s online  
experience safer:  


  * __Teach children never to give Personal Information (such as name, address, phone number, school, etc.) unless supervised by a parent or responsible adult.
  * __Know the sites your children are visiting and which sites are appropriate.
  * __Look for website privacy policies. Know how your child’s information is treated.
