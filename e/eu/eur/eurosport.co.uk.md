**II. YOUR NAVIGATION DATA**

**What are navigation data?**

Your navigation data do not allow you to be identified personally. They only allow the terminal you use to be identified. 

Navigation data are information associated with the equipment, or terminal, you use (computer, smartphone, tablet, etc.), which can be collected and stored in “cookie” files, according to your choices, as and when you access and use the Services. 

**What is a cookie?**

A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers downloaded on to your computer when you access certain websites. Like virtual door keys, cookies unlock a computer's memory and allow a website to recognise users when they return to a site by opening doors to different content or services. Like a key, a cookie itself does not contain information, but when it is read by a _browser_ it can help a website improve the service delivered. 

Cookie files are automatically lodged into the _cookie file_ \- the memory of your browser - and each one typically contains: 

The name of the _server_ the cookie was sent from 

The lifetime of the cookie 

A value - usually a randomly generated unique number 

The website server which sent the cookie uses this number to recognise you when you return to a site or browse from page to page. Only the server that sent a cookie can read, and therefore use, that cookie. 

**Source: _ _http://www.allaboutcookies.org/uk__**

Navigation data mainly consist of the type and version of the browser used by your equipment (Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox, Opera, etc.), the preferred language of the browser software installed on your equipment, the type of operating system used (Windows, Mac Os, Linux, etc.), the IP (Internet Protocol) address of a connected terminal, the URL (often beginning with http://www.) of a web page specific to a particular terminal’s use of a service, the identification and content of a cookie file stored in a terminal, the date, time and duration of a terminal’s connection to an element of a Service (a page, content, section, user account, etc.). 

Some navigation data, such as your equipment’s IP address, are _essential for communication on the Internet_. 

Other navigation data must by law be kept by us to _ensure the security of our Services_ , to detect, prevent or track intrusion attempts and other malicious activities, or breaches of our GTCU, or to respond to requests from third parties permitted by law to request or require disclosure of navigation and personal data of users of our Services. Such data may be, for instance, an IP address, the date, time and duration of a terminal’s connection, the Service used, the content accessed or downloaded, or a click on a feature our Services. 

Lastly, the recording of some navigation data helps us to _tailor our Services to your equipment and usage_ by adapting the content or display of the Services to your equipment or preferences. 

**Who is likely to place cookies in your terminal, and for what purpose?**

**Eurosport**

Eurosport may place cookies in your terminal for various purposes: to help you to navigate our Services more easily, to administer and provide our Services to you and to deliver better and more personalised Services. 

The cookies we place enable us for instance: 

\- to adapt the display format of the content and Services to your terminal, 

\- to track your navigation in order to identify your preferences in terms of content, 

\- to offer you customised content based on your preferences identified via your navigation data, 

\- to display the items you have placed in your shopping basket, and 

\- to recognise your terminal, so that you do not have to re-enter the same information each time you access our Services. 

We collect your navigation data as and when you access and use our Services. These data are intended for us and may therefore be used by us and/or our subsidiaries and/or our contractors on our behalf, in accordance with the confidentiality and security obligations prescribed by law. 

**Third parties: service providers, partners, advertisers, advertising sales houses**

Third parties are likely to place cookies in your terminal. 

We do not control the placing and use of cookies by third party companies. These companies have their own privacy policies and data collection practices. Please refer to each company’s privacy policy to better understand the controls available to you. 

The purpose of the third party cookies of which we are aware is to provide audience-measurement and social-sharing functions and to customise content or advertising. 

**Measurement: audience, traffic, technique**

Audience-measurement cookies are used by third parties for us to obtain information about your browsing patterns, so as to (among other things): 

\- understand how you arrive at a website, and reconstruct your path; 

\- count the number of visitors to a Service, website page and/or Service content, with a view, in particular, to improving the content we offer; 

\- compile traffic and/or conversion statistics; 

\- follow up on invoicing by our partners (advertisers and SEM and Affiliate Marketing firms) on our Service; and 

\- access your user account. 

These tools use technologies for tracking website users and associating a ‘referrer’ or campaign with a unique identifier. 

**Social media share buttons**

We offer you the possibility to share content of the Services with other people or render public your viewing or appreciation of such content by clicking on [social media sharing buttons] such as Recommend (Facebook, Google+), Tweet (Twitter) or Send by email. 

Even if you do not use social media share buttons when visiting our Services, the social networks that provided the buttons can identify you through them. Indeed, the mere fact that your account with a social network is activated on your terminal (open session) when you browse our Services can allow the that network to monitor your navigation of our Services. 

**Advertising spaces**

Cookies are likely to be placed in your terminal through advertising spaces on our Services. 

These cookies may be set at the level of the advertising content displayed in our advertising spaces either by the _advertisers_ themselves, or by their ad serving providers ( _third party ad servers_ ) such as communications consultancies, audience measuring firms and targeted advertising providers: the cookies are associated with the advertising content. 

The main purposes for which advertisers and third party ad servers use cookies are: 

\- to count the number of displays of advertising content in our advertising spaces, identify the advertisements displayed and calculate the amounts payable to the various advertising stakeholders (communications agency, advertising sales house, publishing medium, etc.); 

\- to compile statistics; 

\- to collect navigation data on terminals browsing the Services and, for instance, limit the number of times an advertisement is displayed and/or enable advertisements to appear in a precise order; 

\- to recognise your terminal if and when you subsequently browse any third party website or service on which these advertisers third party ad servers also issue cookies and, if applicable, adapt these third party websites and services, or the advertisements they show, to any navigation data from your terminal that may be known to them; and 

\- to determine whether a particular advertising campaign has produced the desired results by keeping track of how many people clicked on the advertising content or visited the advertiser’s website after seeing the advertisement on our Services. 

Cookies may also be placed in our advertising spaces by the company in charge of managing our advertising spaces: the _advertising sales house_. These cookies enable the advertising sales house: 

\- to do the counting necessary to calculate the amounts to be paid to the various advertising stakeholders and to compile statistics; 

\- to customise the advertising spaces managed by it to your display preferences on your terminal; 

\- to customise the advertising content displayed on your terminal through our advertising spaces to your browsing patterns and geographic location; 

\- to customise the advertising content displayed on your terminal through our advertising spaces to your browsing patterns on third party websites. 

**How long do cookies last?**

There are two types of cookies: _session cookies_ and _persistent cookies_. Session cookies are created temporarily in your browser's subfolder while you are visiting a website and are automatically deleted when you leave the site. Conversely, persistent cookies are re-activated when you return to the same website, and remain in your browser's subfolder until they expire. 

Generally, cookies have a maximum lifespan of 13 months. 

**How can you consent or object to cookies being placed in your terminal?**

Cookies can be generated in various ways: depending on your preferences, you can authorise, refuse or disable cookies. If you disable a cookie already installed on your browser, it will not be active any more; however will disappear from your browser only at the end of its lifespan. Please note that blocking all cookies can render some of our Services unavailable to you or have a negative effect on the performance, efficiency or customization of our Services.
