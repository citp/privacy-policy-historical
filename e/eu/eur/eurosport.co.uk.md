This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Yahoo! does not own or control, or to people that Yahoo! does not employ or manage. In addition, some companies that Yahoo! has acquired have their own, preexisting privacy policies which may be viewed on our [acquired companies page](http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/us/yahoo/acquiredcompanies/).

This Privacy Policy incorporates, where applicable, any additional guidance about our privacy practices relating to particular products or services that can be found under the section "More about Yahoo! Privacy" on the top left of this page.

SARL (based in Switzerland), except where the relevant service is provided by another Yahoo! group company, in which case references to Yahoo! shall, in respect of those services, be references to that Yahoo! Group company. Find out more information about Yahoo! [data storage](http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/uk/yahoo/datastorage/) and [data transfer](http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/uk/yahoo/datatransfer/).

However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information. 
  * We respond to subpoenas, court orders, legal process, or to any legitimate request by authorities with which we must comply. 
  * We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Yahoo!'s terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.
  * This is within the Yahoo! group, for the purposes described under “Information Collection & Use” above (for example, various companies in the Yahoo! group are responsible for storing and processing your information in order to deliver content to you). 
  * Yahoo! may transfer information about you if Yahoo! acquires, or is acquired by or merged with, another company. In this event, Yahoo! will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 



Yahoo! displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteria—for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area. 

  * Yahoo! does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.
