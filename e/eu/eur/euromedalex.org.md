# Privacy Policy | Anna Lindh Foundation

At the Anna Lindh Foundation (the “Foundation”) we take the protection of your data very seriously.

This policy (and our data protection documents and internal policies we are updating in compliance with the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016, the so-called General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”)) explains when and why we collect personal information about people who visit our website, how we use it, the conditions under which we may disclose it to others and how we keep it secure.

##  Who are we?

The Foundation was created by the governments of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, the far-reaching political agreement established in 1995 between the European Union and its Southern Mediterranean partners.

It is an organisation shared and resourced by forty-two Euro-Mediterranean countries, to bring people together as a way to promote dialogue between cultures and respect for diversity.  
To fulfil this objective, the Foundation leads regional initiatives in the Euro-Med space and supports local activities carried out by organisations based across civil society which advocate for a better understanding among people, religions and beliefs, and champion human rights and democracy.  
According to the GDPR, the Foundation is the Data Controller. We are on the way to designate a Data Protection Officer.
