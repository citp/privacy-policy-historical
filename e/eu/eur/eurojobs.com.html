As a European job board, we understand better than most the need for you to maintain control over your personal data when using the Internet. We maintain your privacy through the enforcement of strict internal polices that exceed industry standards. We try to be as transparent as possible, so you can always see and act upon what is being done with your data. Our guidelines for protecting the information you provide us during a visit to our Web site appear below.</p><h3>Privacy Statement</h3><p>This statement discloses the privacy practices for www.Eurojobs.com. We have designed Eurojobs.com so that no personal identifying information is displayed online or is accessible to the general public.</p><h3>What Information We Gather/Track</h3><p>We do NOT collect and/or store any of the following information about our candidates: name, email address, or billing information, such as address, phone number and CV details. We do store contact details for recruiters for verification purposes only. As a free to use site, Eurojobs does not obtain or store credit card details.</p><p>We also receive and may store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses Eurojobs.com. In order to tailor our subsequent communications to you and continuously improve our products and services, we may also ask you to provide us with information regarding your experience with our services. You will have the option of choosing not to provide us with this information.</p><h3>Use of Data</h3><p>Eurojobs.com uses your information to better understand your needs and provide you with a better service. Specifically, we use your information to communicate back to you, to update you on service and benefits and to personalize our website for you.</p><h3>Web Applications</h3><p>Certain online third party applications, such as the various elements we use on Eurojobs.com, store some cookies on your hard drive. The software employs proprietary technology to scan your computer system and retrieve information regarding your installed software and hardware. The information that is retrieved is used to provide the services you have chosen to use. In addition, unless you indicate you do not want this service, the information will be used to generate advertising that is appropriate for you. The information gathered by these applications is used only to generate output directed to you and is not aggregated or used for any other purpose. It is not stored along with any identifying information about you, nor is it sold, rented, or shared with any outside parties in any form whatsoever.</p><h3>Use of Your Email Address</h3><p>Eurojobs.com does not collect or store email addresses, nor do we engage in email marketing. We only send out email as a response to people contacting us. Eurojobs NEVER emails unsolicited job offers, requests for personal information or references. Any unsolicited email received claiming to come from Eurojobs.com will be spam and should be binned immediately. Eurojobs have installed SPF (Sender Policy Framework) which enables receiving email servers to identify incoming email as genuinely coming from Eurojobs.com. Any email that fails to be identified as genuine should be deleted immediately.</p><h3>Who We Share Data With</h3><p>Eurojobs.com will not sell, rent, or lease personally identifiable information to others. Unless we have your permission or are required by law, we will only share the personal data you provide online with other Eurojobs.com entities and/or business partners who are acting on our behalf for the uses described in 'Terms of Use'. By contract, third parties must comply with their own privacy policies with regard to the renting, selling, or sharing of information. As partners of Eurojobs.com, they must also offer Eurojobs.com customers the chance to opt out of information sharing. For advertising purposes, visitor and customer information is statistically aggregated and reported to advertisers. However, we do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to personally identify you, such as your name, email address, account, password, or transaction history.</p><h3>Links</h3><p>Eurojobs.com contains links to other Web sites. Please note that when you click on any one of these links, you are 'clicking' through to another Web site. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of these linked sites, as their privacy policies may differ from ours.</p><h3>Log Files</h3><p>Eurojobs.com does not maintain log files. We use getclicky.com and Google analytics to monitor site traffic. We do not link any information gathered in these log files to personally identifying information. These services are used to manage traffic loads and information technology requirements for providing reliable service. Information collected includes IP addresses and browser types.</p><h3>Feedback</h3><p>We respond to feedback sent to us. Feedback or questions will be answered as quickly as possible. We read all of our customer service queries and use the information contained therein only to resolve the question at hand. We also post surveys on our site, ranging from one to ten questions. These surveys are optional and all information is collected anonymously. The information is collected to better understand our user population. It is not sold or transferred to any third party.</p><h3>Correct/Update/Delete User Information</h3><p>Users (Companies) can update, correct, or delete their company information on Eurojobs.com through our login option on the site.</p><h3>How Eurojobs.com uses cookies on its websites</h3><p>We use cookies and similar tools across our websites to improve our performance and enhance your user experience. This policy explains how we do that.</p><h4>What are cookies?</h4><p>Cookies are small text files which a website may put on your computer or mobile device when you first visit a site or page. The cookie will help the website, or another website, to recognise your device the next time you visit. Web beacons or other similar files can also do the same thing. We use the term “cookies” in this policy to refer to all files that collect information in this way.</p><p>There are many functions cookies are used for. For example, they can help us to remember your username and preferences, analyse how well our website is performing, or even allow us to recommend content we believe will be most relevant to you.</p><p>Certain cookies contain personal information – for example, if you click to “remember me” when logging in, a cookie will store your username. Most cookies won’t collect information that identifies you, and will instead collect more general information such as how users arrive at and use our website, or a user’s general location.</p><h4>What sort of cookies does Eurojobs.com use?</h4><p>Generally, our cookies perform up to four different functions:</p><p>1. Essential cookies</p><p>Some cookies are essential for the operation of our website. For example, some cookies allow us to identify subscribers and ensure they can access the subscription only pages. If a subscriber opts to disable these cookies, the user will not be able to access all of the content that a subscription entitles them to.</p><p>2. Performance Cookies</p><p>We utilise other cookies to analyse how our visitors use our websites and to monitor website performance. This allows us to provide a high quality experience by customising our offering and quickly identifying and fixing any issues that arise. For example, we might use performance cookies to keep track of which pages are most popular, which method of linking between pages is most effective, and to determine why some pages are receiving error messages. We might also use these cookies to highlight articles or site services that we think will be of interest to you based on your usage of the website.</p><p>3. Functionality Cookies</p><p>We use functionality cookies to allow us to remember your preferences. For example, functionality cookies provide you with enhanced services such as allowing you to comment on a blog post.</p><p>4. Behaviourally Targeted Advertising Cookies</p><p>Eurojobs.com and our advertisers use cookies to serve you with advertisements that we believe are relevant to you and your interests. For example, if you read a number of articles on work permits on Eurojobs.com or on other sites, a legal service provider might conclude that you are interested in this topic and serve you with its legal service advertisements. You might see these advertisements on Eurojobs.com and on other sites that you visit. However, we do not tell our advertisers who you are.</p><h4>Does anyone else use cookies on Eurojobs.com?</h4><p>Advertisers sometimes use their own cookies to provide you with targeted advertising. For example, advertisers may use a profile they have built on sites that you have previously visited to present you with more relevant advertisements during your visit to Eurojobs.com. We believe that it is useful to our users to see advertisements that are more relevant to their interests. If you are based in the European Union and would like to learn more about how advertisers use these types of cookies or to choose not to receive them, please visit www.youronlinechoices.eu. If you are based in the United States and would like to learn more, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.</p><p>We also use or allow third parties to serve cookies that fall into the four categories above. For example, like many companies, we use Google Analytics to help us monitor our website traffic. We may also use third party cookies to help us with market research, revenue tracking, improving site functionality and monitoring compliance with our terms and conditions and copyright policy.</p><h4>Can a website user block cookies?</h4><p>As we’ve explained above, cookies help you to get the most out of our websites.</p><p>The first time you accessed our website after 27 June 2012, you should have seen an overlay which explained that by continuing to access our site, you are consenting to our use of cookies.</p><p>Please remember that if you do choose to disable cookies, you may find that certain sections of our website do not work properly.</p><h4>Do we track whether users open our emails?</h4><p>Eurojobs.com does not track whether users open any email message we sent. We only send out confirmation messages when people register an account. That is the only time you can expect a system generated email. All other email sent by Eurojobs.com is in response to an email sent by you.</p><h4>More Information</h4><p>More detail on how businesses use cookies is available at www.allaboutcookies.org.</p><p>If you have any queries regarding this Cookie Policy please contact our Privacy Officer.</p><h3>How to Contact Us</h3><p></p><pre>Privacy Coordinator
