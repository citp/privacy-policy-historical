Edinburgh University Press Ltd is a wholly owned subsidiary of the University of Edinburgh. Our Data Protection Officer can be contacted at [dpo@ed.ac.uk](mailto:dpo@ed.ac.uk "DPO email"). This privacy policy explains how we use any personal information we collect about you. We are fully committed to complying with the General Data Protection Regulation and will do our utmost to protect the information you provide to us.

### What information do we collect about you?

We collect information about you when you publish with us, register on our website, place an order or use products and services. We also collect information when you sign up to our newsletters and our blog, use free access tokens and provide feedback. Website usage information is collected using cookies (view our Cookie Notice further down this page). 

### Explaining the legal basis we rely on:

The law on data protection sets out a number of different reasons for which a company may collect and process your personal data, including:

Consent

In specific situations, we can collect and process your data with your consent. For example, when you tick a box to receive email newsletters.

Contractual obligations

In certain circumstances, we need your personal data to comply with our contractual obligations.

For example, if you order an item from us for delivery, we’ll collect your address details to deliver your purchase, and pass them to our supplier. 

Legitimate interest

In specific situations, we require your data to pursue our legitimate interests in a way which might reasonably be expected as part of running our business. For example, when you become a member of a society that includes a journal subscription. 

### How will we use the information about you and with whom will we share it? 

When you publish with us:

We will use your information in order to implement the terms of the publishing contract. This includes passing your details to external reviewers, copy editors, typesetters, printers and agents working on behalf of Edinburgh University Press. Some of the information you provide will be available in the published product. 

When you register an account with us:

When you register with us, you will need to enter your name, email address and provide a password. We will use this information to provide service requests such as table of contents and citation alerts, activate online subscriptions, use free access tokens, open ebooks you have purchased, access inspection and review copies and to manage your account. You can delete your account at any time.

When you order books and journals from us:

The information you supply to us when you purchase books and journals will be used to process your order. We will pass this information on to our service providers to pick and supply the products.

When you sign up to our subject mailing lists:

We will contact you about products and services we think may be of interest to you, or blog posts that have published only if you have given us your consent to do so by signing up to our mailing lists or blog site. You can withdraw this at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link in the email or emailing [marketing@eup.ed.ac.uk](mailto:marketing@eup.ed.ac.uk "marketing email").  

When you subscribe to journals:

We will use your information to process your subscription order and provide subscription services.

Where journal subscriptions are part of a membership of a society, we are processing your information on behalf of that society and we will share your information with that society.

Where journal subscriptions are included as part of a conference fee, the organisers will supply your information to us so that we can process your subscription and set up access as necessary.

When you apply for a job with us:

We will use the information you provide during the application process will only for the purpose of progressing your application, or to fulfil legal or regulatory requirements if necessary. 

### How long will we hold your information? 

We will only keep records of your personal information for as long as you wish to hear from us or for as long as the contract requires.

### Rights available to individuals
