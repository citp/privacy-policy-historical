# Privacy Policy - Envolve

Are you a developer? Check out [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/), our new platform. Build real-time apps in minutes. 

As frequent web users and privacy sticklers ourselves, we recognize the importance of being respectful of data and building trust with our users. We've therefore created this privacy policy to inform you of what information we collect and how it is used.

##### Your Envolve Account Info

Your email address, payment information, address, and other private account data will never be sold or distributed to third parties except as required to provide you service. Your email address will be used to notify you of critical updates or announcements. It may also be used to send you regular updates about your account activity and news at Envolve. You can opt out of these emails if you like.  


##### Chat Data

We collect information on chat usage in order to provide site owners with analytics and transcript data. Public chat data, including messages sent in public chats, status messages sent, and non-identifying statistical data about usage is provided to site owners. Private chat data, including messages sent in private chats, is not shared with site owners except in non-identifiable, statistical form. Private chats are created by clicking 'Chat' next to a user's name and are marked by the words "Private Chat" at the top of the chat window. We reserve the right to use all chat usage data anonymously for statistics, to improve our product, to provide chat functionality, marketing, etc. 

Envolve is a chat platform for developers to create custom chat experiences. As such, we leave much of the discretion about how public chat information is used up to website owners. If you would like to know more about how your public chat information is being used, you should contact the owners of the websites you use.
