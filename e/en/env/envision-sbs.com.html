								<td><p class="contenus">Envision-sbs.com is owned and operated by Envision Corporation ("ENVISION"). ENVISION collects personal and non-personal information on its site. ENVISION is committed to protecting the privacy of its users. We have created this Privacy Statement in order to describe and explain to users the process of our information collection practice. Since we believe your business is no one else's, your privacy is important to you…and to us. It is our sole intent to protect the information you share with us. To protect your privacy, ENVISION follows different principles in accordance with world-wide practices for customer privacy and data protection.</p>
 
					<ul compact="">
						<li class="contenus">We will not sell or give away your name, mail address, phone number, e-mail address, credit card number or any other information to anyone. 
						</li><li class="contenus">We use state-of-the-art security measures to protect your information from unauthorized users.
					</li></ul> 
					 
					 
					<p class="contb">NOTICE</p>
					
					<p class="contenus">We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (personal information) or allows us to contact you. Generally this information is requested when you create a Registration ID on the site, buy our products or services or when you order e-mail newsletters. We use your Personal Information for three primary purposes:</p>
					 
					<ul compact="">
						<li class="contenus">To make the site easier for you to use by not having to enter information more than once. 
						</li><li class="contenus">To help you quickly find information. 
						</li><li class="contenus">To alert you of product upgrades, special offers, updated information and other new services from ENVISION. 
					</li></ul> 
					 
					<p class="contb">CONSENT</p>
					
					<p class="contenus">If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you can still use most of our web site. But you will not be able to access areas that require registration.</p> 
					
					<p class="contenus">If you decide to register, you will be able to select the types of information you want to receive from us by subscribing to various services, like our electronic newsletters. If you do not want us to communicate with you about other offers regarding ENVISION products, programs, events, or services by e-mail, postal mail, or telephone, you may select the option stating that you do not wish to receive marketing messages from ENVISION.</p> 
					
					 
					<p class="contb">ACCESS</p>
					
					<p class="contenus">We will provide you with the means to ensure that your personal information is correct and current. You may review and update this information at any time by consulting your Profile. You will be able to:</p>
					 
					<ul compact="">
						<li class="contenus">View and edit personal information you have already given us. 
						</li><li class="contenus">Tell us whether you want us to send you marketing information.
						</li><li class="contenus">Sign up for electronic newsletters about our services and products. 
						</li><li class="contenus">Register. Once you register, you won't need to do it again. 
					</li></ul>  
					 
					<p class="contb">SECURITY</p>
					
					<p class="contenus">ENVISION has taken strong measures to protect the security of your personal information and to ensure that your choices for its intended use are honored. We take strong precautions to protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction.</p> 
					 
					<p class="contenus">We guarantee your e-commerce transactions to be 100% safe and secure. When you place orders or access your personal account information, you're utilizing a secure server software SSL, which encrypts your personal information before it's sent over the Internet. SSL is one of the safest encryption technologies available.</p>
					 
					<p class="contenus">In addition, your transactions are guaranteed under the Fair Credit Billing Act. This Act states that your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00 in fraudulent credit card charges. If your bank does hold you liable for $50.00 or less, we'll cover your liability provided the unauthorized, fraudulent use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own and from purchases made from us over our secure server. In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.</p>
					
					<p class="contenus">ENVISION strictly protects the security of your personal information and honors your choices for its intended use. We carefully protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction.</p> 
					
					<p class="contenus">Your personal information is never shared outside the company without your permission, except under conditions explained above. Inside the company, data is stored in password-controlled servers with limited access.</p> 
					
					<p class="contenus">You also have a significant role in protecting your information. No one can see or edit your personal information without knowing your user name and password, so do not share these with others.</p>
					 
					 
					<p class="contb">ENFORCEMENT</p>
					
					<p class="contenus">If for some reason you believe ENVISION has not adhered to these principles, please notify us by e-mail at <a href="mailto:privacy@envision-sbs.com" class="mail">privacy@envision-sbs.com</a>, and we will do our best to determine and correct the problem promptly. Be certain the words Privacy Policy are in the Subject line.</p>
					 
					 
					<p class="contb">CUSTOMER PROFILES</p>
					 
					<p class="contenus">As mentioned above, every registered customer has a unique personal profile. Each profile is assigned a unique personal identification number, which helps us ensure that only you can access your profile.</p>
					
					<p class="contenus">When you register, we create your profile, assign a personal identification number, then send this personal identification number back to your hard drive in the form of a cookie, which is a very small bit of code. This code is uniquely yours. It is your passport to seamless travel across Envision-sbs.com, allowing you to order free newsletters without having to fill out registration forms with information you've already provided. Even if you switch computers, you won't have to re-register - just use your Registration ID to identify yourself.</p> 
					 
					 
					<p class="contb">WHAT WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION YOU SHARE</p>
					
					<p class="contenus">When you join us, you provide us with your contact information, including your name and e-mail address. We use this information to send you updates about your order, questionnaires to measure your satisfaction with our service and announcements about new and exciting services that we offer. When you order from us, we ask for your credit card number and billing address. We use this information only to bill you for the product(s) you order at that time. For your convenience, we do save billing information in case you want to order from us again, but we don't use this information again without your permission.</p>
					 
					<p class="contenus">We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering customer questions about products or services, sending postal mail and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.</p>
					
					<p class="contenus">ENVISION will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on ENVISION or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of ENVISION and its family of Web sites, and, (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of ENVISION, its Web sites, or the public.</p>
					 
					<p class="contb">HOW CAN I OPT-OUT</p>
					 
					<p class="contenus">We provide a user with the opportunity to opt-out from receiving updates on new products, newsletters, and other promotional materials. The opt-out option may be exercised in the user's profile. You can select not to be contacted in the future if you wish to not receive any information with respect to ENVISION and our products. You may also delete your account. Account deletion will erase all past entries in regards to your account. If you erase your account, you will have to re-register with us if you wish to access certain areas within the web site.</p> 
					 
					<p class="contenus">If you do not have a user's profile, you can opt-out by sending an e-mail, with the subject heading "Privacy Statement Opt-Out," to <a href="mailto:webmaster@envision-sbs.com" class="mail">webmaster@envision-sbs.com</a>. In the e-mail, you should request the opt-out option.</p> 
					 
					 
					<p class="contb">DOES ENVISION'S PRIVACY POLICY APPLY TO LINKED WEB SITES?</p>
					 
					<p class="contenus">Our Privacy Policy applies solely to information collection practice on Envision-sbs.com. This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that ENVISION has no control or influence over the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave Envision-sbs.com and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that they visit.</p> 
					 
					 
					<p class="contb">CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT</p>
					 
					<p class="contenus">If we later change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on our homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personal information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by e-mail. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner by making changes to their profile.</p></td>
