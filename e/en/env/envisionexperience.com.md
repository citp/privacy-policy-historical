# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy is provided by Leadership Platform Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation, doing business as Envision EMI (“Envision,” “Envision EMI,” or “we”) and is applicable to this Site and any other website operated by Envision.

**Envision EMI** is committed to providing a safe and secure website. We are dedicated to safeguarding all personally identifiable information collected online and to helping our visitors learn how to exercise control over their personally identifiable information while exploring our websites. To help ensure a rewarding online experience for all visitors, we provide this summary of our information practices. This privacy notice governs the collection and use of your personal information.

This Envision Site is not intended to target children under the age of 13. However, it is possible that from time to time children below the age of 13 will register at our Site. Therefore, we are providing notices and information required by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).

COPPA requires that we inform parents and legal guardians about how Envision collects, uses, and discloses Personally Identifiable Information from children less than 13 years of age. The statute also requires that Envision generally obtain the consent of parents or guardians before children under 13 years of age to access our Web site. This Privacy Policy is designed to fully comply with COPPA.

We encourage teachers to check with their schools for their specific rules and regulations regarding disclosure of student information. 

As we continue to offer different types of content and services, we may modify our practices from time to time. However, we will treat all Personally Identifiable Information we collect in accordance with the privacy notice in effect at the time the information is collected.

####  I. THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT ONLINE

At Envision EMI, we do not collect Personally Identifiable Information unless our visitors voluntarily provide it to us. This information is necessary for enrollment in our programs, for nominations of students for our programs and for program information requests. When visitors come to our website, we automatically collect some non-personally identifiable information such as the type of computer operating system (e.g., Windows 7 or Mac OS) and browser (e.g., Chrome, Internet Explorer) being used, and the domain name of the Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Verizon). 

When a parent or a child registers on our site, we collect the information voluntarily provided at the time of registration. The only information we collect during our child registration process is a first and last name, email address, the child’s interest, the identity of the registrant as a parent, teacher or child, a phone number and the child’s grade in school.

#### II. HOW WE USE COLLECTED INFORMATION

We use website visitors' Personally Identifiable Information in order to respond to visitors’ requests for information. We also use the Information for various internal purposes such as enabling enrollment in our programs, sending program information to registrants via regular or electronic mail, and communicating with you for the purpose of sending important program notifications or updates. We may also use your information to send you emails about other programs, promotions or services (or those of our affiliates) that we think might be of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive such ongoing communication from Envision, please email us at [webmaster@envisionexperience.com](mailto:webmaster@envisionexperience.com) and we will comply promptly with your request.

#### III. Sharing Your Information with Third Parties

  * **When Information May Be Shared.** We may share a child’s Personally Identifiable Information with third parties to the extent reasonably necessary to: protect the security and Integrity of Envision Sites; to take precautions against liability; to respond to judicial process; or to the extent permitted under provisions of law, to provide information to law enforcement agencies or for an investigation related to public safety. Envision has no ability or authority to control the policies of third parties. However, prior to providing any Personally Identifiable Information of a child who registers on an Envision Site, we receive representations from third parties that their privacy policies comply with COPPA. We may request updated representation from time to time.
  * **Special Offers.** We only share your information with third parties in limited circumstances. Except as provided below with respect to Third-Party Service Providers, Envision EMI will never rent, sell or share names of persons who register for our programs or those who are nominated for programs, nor will we sell or share names of minors. Envision EMI may share parents’ Personally Identifiable Information, non-personally identifiable information (i.e., aggregate, anonymous) and/or household information with reputable companies that offer products or services which we think may be of interest to you. To decline such special offers, email us at [webmaster@envisionexperience.com](mailto:webmaster@envisionexperience.com). Envision EMI will also disclose information of both parents and children as required by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena or in response to a law enforcement agency's request.
  * **Third-Party Service Providers.** We also employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. We may disclose Personally Identifiable Information and/or non-personally identifiable information which has been submitted by parents or children for enrollment purposes. In addition, we may share such information with our affiliates, trusted technology partners and third-party vendors who generate educational program content, create nomination and enrollment materials, provide customer service or billing services, consult with parents and teachers, and supervise online forums, message boards, social networks and blogs. These third parties have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of Personally Identifiable Information in full compliance with COPPA. They have access to Personally Identifiable Information which is needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
  * **Notice.** Except for those circumstances described above in this Section III, you will receive notice when Personally Identifiable Information about you or your child might go to third parties and you will have an opportunity to choose to withhold the information.

#### IV. COOKIES

We use a software technology called "cookies." Cookies are small text files that we place in visitors' computer browsers to store their preferences. Cookies themselves do not contain any Personally Identifiable Information. We also use cookies to determine how many visitors we have and how often they visit various sections of our site. We may use the information collected through these cookies for many purposes, including the delivery of content and tracking and enhancing our Users’ experience on our websites. For example, when a User returns to an Envision Site after logging in, cookies provide information to the site so that the Site will remember the identity of the User. We also may use technology methods to analyze the traffic patterns on our websites, e.g., determining the frequency with which Users visit various components of our Sites or third party websites. We do not use cookies or other technological means to collect Personally Identifiable Information. 

#### V. SECURITY 

    * To safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security and correctly use the information we collect online, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures.
    * We are particularly sensitive to visitors' security concerns regarding the use of credit cards to purchase products over the Internet. We use a technology that automatically encrypts credit card data while information is being transmitted over the Internet, provided that the visitor's browser supports the Secure Socket Layer protocol (SSL).
    * To verify the security of your connection, check the lower right corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken or a closed lock, then SSL is active and the server is secure. You may also check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the site address will change from http:// to https://.
