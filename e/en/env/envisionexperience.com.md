**SECURITY**

To safeguard your Personal Information and help protect your Personal Information against loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, and to maintain data security, we have put in place appropriate physical, technical and administrative procedures.  We are particularly sensitive to visitors' security concerns regarding the use of credit cards to purchase products over the Internet.  We use a technology that automatically encrypts credit card data while information is being transmitted over the Internet, provided that the visitor's browser supports the Secure Socket Layer protocol (SSL).  To verify the security of your connection, check the lower right corner of your browser window after accessing the server.  If you see an unbroken or a closed lock, then SSL is active and the server is secure.  You may also check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the site address will change from http:// to https://.

Please keep in mind that no electronic data transmission or storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure or error free and we cannot warrant or ensure the security of any information that you transmit to us.
