# Environment Agency - Privacy Policy

Statement of Intent

In order to access the services we provide and to provide us with feedback, you will be asked to submit personal information about yourself (e.g. name, address, and telephone number). The services provided include licence application, environmental information, provision of feedback and consultations.

By entering your details the Environment Agency will be able to provide you with the services you select. Whenever you provide personal information, we undertake to treat that information in accordance with this policy.

Submitting Personal Information

When you supply personal information to the Environment Agency we have legal obligations towards you in the way we deal with that information. We have to process information within the framework of our statutory duties and powers and in addition we have to collect the information fairly. The individual notices on particular webpages, forms or specifically given to you let you know how we will use the information and whether we will pass the information on to anyone else.

Use and Disclosure of Personal Information

We use personal information to deal with licence applications, to monitor compliance with the licence/permit/registration conditions, to process renewals, preventing and investigating breaches of environmental law, for maintaining the relevant public register(s), dealing with complaints, consultations and for providing environmental literature.

We may disclose personal data to our consultants, agents and representatives to do these things on our behalf. In addition to other public bodies and other organisations (e.g. Health and Safety Executive Local Authorities, Emergency Services, DEFRA) for consultation on environmental issues.

We do not sell personal information to any third parties unless that information is public register information. We generally do not share personal information with any third parties other than those mentioned above unless they agree to protect the privacy of personal information in the same manner we do or we are required by law to disclose the information.

We will only hold personal data on our systems for a strictly limited period of time. For the most part the time period will be set as a matter of internal policy and will be the minimum necessary for our use.

Access to your Personal Information

You have the right to request a copy of the personal information the Environment Agency holds about you and to have any inaccuracies in that personal information corrected. Please address requests to the National Data Protection Manager or use the on-line enquiry form.

Direct Marketing

From time to time we may wish to provide you with details of other services or literature about environmental matters available from the Environment Agency which may be of interest to you. We may also offer you the opportunity to participate in the consultation process for new methods, strategies, works or schemes proposed by the Environment Agency.

Users under 18

If you are under 18, please make sure that you obtain your parent/guardian's permission beforehand whenever you provide personal information to the Environment Agency on its website or by other means.

Security of Personal Information

We share the general concern over the safety and security of personal information on the Internet and have implemented procedures to promote the safety and security of information we collect online. We have implemented industry standard controls to try to ensure confidentiality; however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We cannot therefore guarantee that personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.
