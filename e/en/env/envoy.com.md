# Privacy Policy - Envoy

Welcome to the web site (the “Site”) of Envoy, Inc. (“Envoy”, “we”, “us” and/or “our”). This Site is operated by Envoy and has been created to provide information about Envoy and the Envoy visitor registration services we provide through the Site, through any mobile applications, and related services (collectively, such services, including any new features and applications, and the Site, the “Services”) to our Site visitors (“you”, “your”). This Privacy Policy sets forth Envoy’s policy with respect to information including personally identifiable data (“Personal Data”) and other information that is collected from users of the Services. The Services are designed to permit business customers (“Business Customers”) and their visitors (“Visitors”) to complete a sign-in or registration process electronically using companion applications.

### Information We Collect

When you interact with us through the Services, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below:

  * **Personal Data That You Provide**   
We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you contact us with inquiries or register yourself or your company online for access to the Services. Wherever Envoy collects Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy. By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide us Personal Data, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Envoy and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States. 
  * **Non-Identifiable Data**   
When you interact with Envoy through the Services, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. Envoy may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Envoy affiliates, agents or service providers. We may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of users of our Services, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers. It is important to note that no Personal Data is available or used in this process.   
In operating the Services, we may use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that our computers give to your browser when you access the Site. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Services and help us analyze usage of the Services more accurately. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the special features of the Services. 
  * **Aggregated Personal Data**   
In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve our users, Envoy often conducts research on user demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and Envoy may share this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. Envoy may also disclose aggregated user statistics to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes. 
  * **Aggregated Personal Data**   
Our Service may collect and use your location information (for example, by using the Location Services on your mobile device) to provide certain functionality of our Service, including facilitating Visitor registration for Business Customers. Your location information is not made available to other users without your express permission. We may also use your location information in an aggregate way, as described above in the “Aggregated Personal Data” section. 
  * **Google Analytics and Similar Technologies**   
We may allow third party service providers to use cookies or similar technologies to collect information about your browsing activities over time and across different websites following your use of the Services. For example, we use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies to help us analyze how users use the Site and enhance your experience when you use the Service. For more information on how Google uses this data, go to <https://google.com/policies/privacy/partners/>. 



### Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information

Envoy uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with such access and to monitor your use of such Services. Envoy and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the “Related Companies”) may also use your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected to help us improve the content and functionality of the Site and Services, to better understand our users and to improve the Site and Services. Envoy and its affiliates may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so, each marketing communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out" of receiving future marketing communications. In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future marketing communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below.

As described above, Envoy provides Visitor registration services to its Business Customers. In connection with those Services, our Business Customers may electronically submit to us data or information they possess about their Visitors (“Business Customer Data”) for hosting and processing purposes in connection with the Services. Envoy only uses Business Customer Data per the terms of our relevant agreement with our Business Customers, or as may be required by law.

Visitors should note that by using the Services, you may have the option to grant access or otherwise share your Personal Data with a Business Customer in an automated manner. A Business Customer’s use and disclosure of your Personal Data which you have made available through the Services is governed by the terms of such Business Customer’s privacy policy or other agreements which you may in place with such Business Customer.

The Services may permit a Business Customer (or its authorized agents) to connect with a Visitor through the Services, including via SMS or email or other methods of communication. Note that by communicating with a Visitor, an agent of a Business Customer may be sharing its Personal Data, including its name and email address, with such Visitor. This Privacy Policy does not govern the use of Personal Data by a Visitor.

### Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information

Envoy is not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:

  * **Business Transfers**  
As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.
  * **Related Companies**  
We may also share your Personal Data with our Related Companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.
  * **Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties**  
Envoy, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing payments. When we employ another entity to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.
  * **Legal Requirements**  
Envoy may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect or defend the rights or property of Envoy or others, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of our users or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.



### Your Choices

You can visit the Site without providing any Personal Data. If you choose not to provide any Personal Data, you may not be able to use certain features of the Site or the Services.

### Exclusions

This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Data collected by Envoy other than Personal Data collected through the Services. This Privacy Policy shall not apply to any unsolicited information you provide to Envoy through any means. This includes, but is not limited to, information posted to any public areas of the Site or the Services, any ideas for new products or modifications to existing products, and other unsolicited submissions (collectively, “Unsolicited Information”). All Unsolicited Information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and Envoy shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, and distribute such Unsolicited Information to others without limitation or attribution.

### Children

Envoy does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Data. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Data without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Data to Envoy, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.

### Links to Other Web Sites

This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. The Site or Services may contain links to other web sites not operated or controlled by Envoy. The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to the third party sites or services. Any links do not imply that Envoy endorses or has reviewed third party sites or services. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies.

### Security

Envoy takes reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data provided via the Services from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Data to Envoy via the Internet.

Our business may change from time to time. As a result, at times it may be necessary for Envoy to make changes to this Privacy Policy. Envoy reserves the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time without prior notice.
