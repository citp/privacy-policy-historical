  * the fact that we have collected your personal information, if it is likely that: 
    * we collected the information from another source; or
    * you may not be aware that we have collected the information;

## 8\. Cookies

In some cases, we may also collect your personal information using cookies. When you access our website, we may send a “cookie” (a small summary file containing a unique ID number) to your computer. 

Cookies are used to maintain a user’s settings and preferences on a website, and can be analysed by us to help improve our online services.  Our cookies do not collect personal information. If you do not wish to receive cookies, you can set your browser so that your computer does not accept them.

We may also log IP addresses (the electronic addresses of computers connected to the Internet) to assist in analysing trends, administering the website, and gathering broad demographic information.

Our website also uses Google Analytics, a service which transmits website traffic data to Google servers in the United States. We use Google Analytics in order to understand how users engage with our website. Data transmitted includes, for example, the web address of the page that you're visiting and your IP address. Google may also set cookies on your browser, or read cookies that are already there. Google may transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf.

More information about how Google Analytics collects and processes data is described in Google's Privacy Policy. If you don’t want Google Analytics to be used in your browser, you can use the [opt-out service provided by Google](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) or the [’incognito’ mode](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95464?hl=en) in your browser. 

## 9\. What happens if we can't collect your personal information?

When interacting with us, you are not required to identify yourself. You may use a pseudonym. However, this does not apply if:

  * it is impracticable for us to interact with you, because you have not identified yourself or you use a pseudonym; or
  * we are required or authorised by or under an Australian law, or a court/tribunal order, to interact with individuals who have identified themselves. For example, the _Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999_ ( **EPBC Act**) and associated Regulations require personal information to be provided for the purposes of referrals, approvals and permits. There are mandatory requirements for this information to be published and/or made available for public comment. Public comments received by us also contain personal information about the individual making the submission.



If you do not provide us with the personal information described above, some or all of the following may happen:

  * we may not be able to provide the requested products or services to you, either to the same standard or at all;
  * we may not be able to provide you with information about products and services that you may want; or
  * you may be in breach of an Australian law requiring you to provide such information. However, in this circumstance you would be advised of our legal powers to require such information from you and the implications of any failure to do so.



## 10\. How do we treat unsolicited personal information?

From time to time, we receive personal information that is additional to information that we have solicited or information that we have not taken active steps to collect. This is known as ‘unsolicited personal information’ and includes:

  * misdirected mail received by us;
  * correspondence to us, our Minister and Parliamentary Secretary from members of the community, or other unsolicited correspondence;
  * a petition sent to us that contains names and addresses;
  * employment, internship, work experience or volunteering applications sent to us on an individual’s own initiative and not in response to an advertised vacancy;
  * a promotional flyer or email containing personal information, sent to us by an individual promoting the individual’s business or services;
  * court documents for proceedings to which we are a party or may have an interest; and
  * information supplied by an informant or another enforcement body, which relates to our function as an enforcement body.



If we receive unsolicited personal information and we decide that we are not permitted to collect it in accordance with the privacy principles, we will take reasonable steps to destroy or de-identify the information as soon as practicable, unless it is contained in a ‘Commonwealth record’ or it is unlawful or unreasonable to do so.

## 11\. Why do we collect, store, use and disclose your personal information?

We collect personal information about you so that we can perform our activities and functions and endeavour to provide quality customer service.

We may collect, hold, use and disclose your personal information for purposes that include the following:

Your personal information will not be shared, sold, rented or disclosed other than as described in this privacy policy.

## 12\. How do we use your personal information?

We can use your personal information for the primary purpose for which it was collected. (Our privacy notice (see section 6 above) will explain the primary purpose.) We may also use your personal information for other purposes that are permitted under the Privacy Act. Those other purposes include where:

  * we obtain your consent to use the information for that other purpose;

  * we reasonably believe that the disclosure is necessary for an enforcement related purpose.



## 13\. Disclosure of personal information

We may disclose your personal information to third parties that we specify in our privacy notice when we collect the information, or to whom disclosure is otherwise permitted under the Privacy Act. Without limiting this, those third parties could be: ​

Public submissions made on applications, permits or referrals may be published by us as part of the assessment process required under the EPBC Act. Individuals that make submissions to us will have the option of having their personal details removed before publication.

## 14\. Do we disclose your personal information to anyone overseas?

We may disclose personal information to third party suppliers and service providers, researchers and governments located overseas for some of the purposes listed in paragraph 13 of this policy. This includes disclosure to:

  * peer reviewers anywhere in the world where the appropriate scientific expertise exists; and
  * overseas recipients if we believe the disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary for our enforcement related functions and the recipient is a body that performs functions, or exercises powers, that are similar to those performed or exercised by an Australian enforcement body.



We will take reasonable steps to ensure that the overseas recipients of your personal information do not breach the privacy obligations relating to your personal information.

## 15\. Storage and access to personal information

### 15.1 How is your personal information stored and secured?

We take reasonable steps to ensure your personal information is protected from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. We may hold your information in either electronic or hard copy form. Where reasonable and practicable to do so, personal information is destroyed or de-identified when no longer needed.

Personal information that is contained in hard copy is secured in accordance with our Information Security Policy.

However, as our website is linked to the internet, and the internet is inherently insecure, we cannot provide any assurance regarding the security of transmission of information you communicate to us via our website. We also cannot guarantee that the information you supply by email will not be intercepted while being transmitted. Accordingly, any personal information or other information, which you transmit to us, is transmitted at your own risk.

Sensitive enforcement-related personal information is held in a restricted database and appropriate security clearances are required to access such information.

### 15.2 Who has access to your personal information within the Department?

We take reasonable steps to ensure that access to your personal information occurs only for legitimate purposes and on a need to know basis.

### 15.3 Personal information no longer required

We take reasonable steps to ensure that we delete or de-identify personal information that is no longer required for the purpose for which the information was originally collected.

In addition, personal information in electronic form is deleted if it is no longer required. Similarly, personal information contained in undelivered emails or return post is deleted or destroyed from our databases.

## 16\. How can you access and correct your personal information?

You may request access to any personal information we hold about you at any time by contacting us (details below). Where we hold information that you are entitled to access, we will try to provide you with suitable means of accessing it (for example, by mailing or emailing it to you). We will not charge you for providing your personal information to you, or for the costs of making any corrections to your personal information.

There may be instances where we cannot grant you access to your personal information. For example, we may need to refuse access if we are required or authorised to refuse access under an Australian law. If that happens, we will give you written notice of the reasons for the refusal within 30 days of receipt of your request, together with information about how you can complain about our refusal, if you wish to do so.

If you believe that your personal information is incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate, then you may request us to amend it. We will consider whether the information requires amendment. If we do not agree that there are grounds for amendment, we will give you written notice of the reasons for the refusal within 30 days of receipt of your request, together with information about how you can complain about our refusal, if you wish to do so.

Current and former employees can make arrangements to access their personal information with our Personnel Section at [personnelhelpdesk@environment.gov.au](mailto:personnelhelpdesk@environment.gov.au).

If you have any questions about this privacy policy, any concerns or a complaint regarding the treatment of your privacy or a possible breach of your privacy, please use the contact link on our website or contact our Privacy Officer via the details set out below (at paragraph 18).

We will treat your requests or complaints as your personal information.
