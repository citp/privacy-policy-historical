## DATA SECURITY

We take the security of your information very seriously. We have been very careful in developing processes and employing technology to protect against any current and future security threats in these areas.

CII is committed to protecting the security of your information and adopts reasonable standard, industry-wide practices for protecting your information. However, no internet data transmission is 100% secure, and hence we cannot ensure that the information you transmit to us won't be intercepted over the internet. We recommend that you practice online security measures such as having strong passwords and not disclosing your password to anyone.

If CII learns of a security system breach, we may attempt to notify you and provide information on protective steps, if available, through the email address that you have provided to us or by posting a notice on the Site.

We use 128-bit Public/Private key encryption for data and files transfers and hold high-assurance SSL Certificates—a worldwide accepted security certificate and the highest measure to prevent threats and plagiarism.

## DATA CONFIDENTIALITY

Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to authorized users and preventing access by or disclosure to unauthorized ones.

Data confidentiality covers data in storage, during processing, and in transit. CII guarantees that your data will not be accessed or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes and will be protected from intentional or accidental attempts to perform unauthorized data reads.

### Physical Access Control

Access control is determined by the software, hardware and liveware (humans) that enforce it. CII has a system of controls that limit access to the organizations’ resources.

### Network Protection

Also critical to confidentiality are protections against malicious software (malware), spyware, spam, and phishing attacks. CII servers are protected behind a firewall to prevent users from accessing them other than by specifically allowed protocols and methods. CII also maintains a detection method which picks up suspicious activity that may signal an intrusion and tracks each transaction by the user login details and provides a timestamp for each event.

CII is an ISO/IEC 27001:2013-certified organization committed to adhering to the highest standards of information security, client confidentiality, and trust. To learn more about the ISO/IEC 27001:2013, visit [https://www.iso.org](https://www.iso.org/).
