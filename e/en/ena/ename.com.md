# Privacy Policy:The preferred platform of domain buying & selling

**Information Collection**  
We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way, including through email, telephone, or other communications with our customer service department. If you contact us for support, we will keep an internal record of what support was given.  
We will not sell or rent this information to anyone.  
**We will not sell or rent this information to anyone.**  
We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.  
The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.  
**WHOIS**  
We are required by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN"), the organization that assumes responsibility for domain name allocation, to collect information about you during the domain name registration process. This information includes your full name, mailing address, phone number, email address, and, where provided, your facsimile number. ICANN then requires all registrars to make your full name, mailing address, phone number, email address, and, where provided, your facsimile number, as well as the creation and expiration dates of your domain name registration and the name server information associated with your domain name, to the public via an interactive Web page and a "port 43" WHOIS service. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy we will refer to this information as your "WHOIS Information." Please note that we may not be able to control how members of the public may use the WHOIS Information.  
**Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement**  
We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including without limitation subpoenas), to protect our property and rights or the property and rights of a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical. We will also share your information to the extent necessary to comply with ICANN's rules, regulations and policies.  
**Cookies**  
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser. Besides using the information as described above, eName utilizes cookies to control the flow of the ordering processes by maintaining the state of your online transactions.  
**Children**  
eName does not sell services for purchase by children. If you are under 18, you may use our services only with involvement of a parent or guardian.  
**Choice and Opt-Out**  
If you no longer wish to receive the Company's promotional communications, you may "opt-out" of receiving them by following the instructions included in each communication or by e-mailing the Company at mrgamegroup@yahoo.ca.
