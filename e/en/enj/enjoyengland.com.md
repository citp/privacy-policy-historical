As such we are a global organisation.

For the purposes explained in this Policy, your information may be transferred and/or processed (a) by and between our London and international offices (b) to other third parties (who are acting as our authorised data processors) in countries which do not have the same level of data protection laws as those in the country where you are located.

 **5\. Marketing communications**

When you provide us with contact details, such as when you purchase a product, contact us for customer support or create an account for one of our services, you may be given the opportunity to opt-in to (or in certain cases where applicable law allows, opt-out of) receiving various newsletters and other communications from us. These communications may include, for instance, details about our latest products and services, including upgrades and special offers in which you may be interested.

You can change your marketing communication preferences at any time:

  * If you would like to unsubscribe from an email sent to you, follow the ‘unsubscribe’ link and/or instructions placed (typically) at the bottom of the email. But note that:
    * If you use more than one e-mail address to shop with us or contact us on, you will need to unsubscribe separately for each email address
    * This method will only unsubscribe you for emails. You will need to separately unsubscribe for other types of marketing communications you receive.

  *  **What we do to protect your information**

We take a number of steps to protect your information from unauthorised access, use or alteration and unlawful destruction, including where appropriate:

    * Using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption when collecting or transferring sensitive information, such as credit card details (SSL encryption is designed to make the data unreadable by anyone but us)

    * Putting in place physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in line with industry standards
  *  **What you should do to protect your information**

  *  **Do not** use the same password for multiple accounts
  *  **Do** use very long passwords (at least 10 characters, but preferably much longer)
  *  **Do** use passwords which contain a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and special characters e.g. $%^& etc.
  *  **Do** keep passwords securely (never written down, or shared with anyone) and changed periodically
