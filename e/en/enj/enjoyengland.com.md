 **5\. International transfers of your information**

 **5.1.  **In this paragraph, we provide information about the circumstances in which your personal data may be transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA).

 **5.2.**  The British Tourist Authority is a statutory body incorporated under the Development of Tourism Act 1969 with its headquarters based in London, England. We have an international network of offices to assist in delivering our core function of promoting the development of tourism to and within Great Britain and encouraging people to visit Great Britain. As such we are a global organisation.

 **5.3.** The hosting facilities for our website(s) are situated in Ireland and the United Kingdom (except for any region-specific websites, such as, without limitation, China).

 **5.4.** Some of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.

 **5.5.**  Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:

 **5.5.1.**  We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see European Commission: [Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries.](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en)

 **5.5.2.**  Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission: [Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en)

 **5.5.3.  **Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: [EU-US Privacy Shield.](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/eu-us-privacy-shield_en)

 **5.6.**  Please contact us using the details set out at the bottom of this Policy if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.

 **6\. Security of your personal information**

While we cannot guarantee that unauthorised access will never occur, we can assure you that we take great care in maintaining the security of your personal data to prevent unauthorised access to it, through the use of appropriate technology and internal procedures.

 **6.1.  What we do to protect your information**

We take a number of steps to protect your information from unauthorised access, use or alteration and unlawful destruction, including where appropriate:

 **6.1.1.  **Using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption when collecting or transferring sensitive information, such as credit card details (SSL encryption is designed to make the data unreadable by anyone but us).

 **6.1.2.**  Limiting access to the information we collect about you (for instance, only those of our personnel who need your information to carry out our business activities are allowed access).

 **6.1.3.  **Putting in place physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in line with industry standards.

 **6.2.  What you should do to protect your information**

As general best practice on the Internet, it is recommended that individuals take great care with user accounts, and follow some basic rules:

 **6.1.1.  Do not **use trivial passwords (such as single dictionary words).

 **6.1.2.  Do not** use the same password for multiple accounts.

 **6.1.3.**   **Do** use very long passwords (at least 10 characters, but preferably much longer)

 **6.1.4**.  **Do** use passwords which contain a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and special characters e.g. $%^& etc.

 **6.1.5.  Do** keep passwords securely (never written down, or shared with anyone) and changed periodically.

 **7.  Cookies **

**7.1.**  Our websites use industry-wide technologies, such as “cookies”, to collect information about the use of our websites and email communications. For instance, these technologies may tell us which visitors clicked on key elements (such as links or graphics) on a website or email and recognise your browser the next time you visit our websites.

 **7.2.  **Cookies allow us to customise your experience to better match your interests and preferences, or to simply facilitate your signing in to use the services. Most browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block acceptance of cookies or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. However, if you block or erase cookies, we may not be able to restore any preferences or customisation settings you have previously specified, and our ability to personalise your online experience would be limited. Please refer to your browser instructions to learn more about these functions.

 **7.3.**  More information about our use of cookies can be found in our [Cookies Policy.](https://www.visitbritain.com/gb/en/privacy-and-cookies)

 **8.1.**  This paragraph 8 sets out our data retention policies and procedure, which are designed to help ensure that we comply with our legal obligations in relation to the retention and deletion of personal data.

 **8.2.**  Personal data that we process for any purpose or purposes shall not be kept for longer than is necessary for that purpose or those purposes.

(c) emails can be retained for a period of 5 years since receipt by us.

 **8.4.  **In some cases it is not possible for us to specify in advance the periods for which your personal data will be retained. In such cases, we will determine the period of retention by taking into consideration the period necessary for retention for its lawful purpose.

 **8.5.** Notwithstanding the other provisions of this paragraph 8, we may retain your personal data where such retention is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person.

 **9.  Access to your information and your rights**

 **9.1.  **In this paragraph, we have provided a summary of the rights that you have under current data protection law. Accordingly, you should read the relevant laws and guidance from the regulatory authorities for a full explanation of these rights.

(d) the right to erasure;

(e) the right to restrict processing;

(f) the right to object to processing;

(g) the right to data portability;

(h) the right to complain to a supervisory authority; and

(i) the right to withdraw consent.

 **9.3.  **You have the right to confirmation as to whether or not we process your personal data and, where we do, access to the personal data, together with certain additional information. That additional information includes details of the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned and the recipients of the personal data. Providing the rights and freedoms of others are not affected, we will supply to you a copy of your personal data. The first electronic copy will be provided free of charge, but additional copies in specific formats may be subject to a reasonable fee.

 **9.4.  **You have the right to rectify any inaccurate personal data we hold about you and, taking into account the purposes of the processing, to have any incomplete personal data about you completed.

 **9.5.  **In some circumstances you have the right to the erasure of your personal data without undue delay. Those circumstances include: the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent to consent-based processing; you object to the processing under certain rules of applicable data protection law; the processing is for direct marketing purposes; and the personal data have been unlawfully processed. However, there are exclusions of the right to erasure. The general exclusions include where processing is necessary: for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information; for compliance with a legal obligation; or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

 **9.6.  **In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data. Those circumstances are: you contest the accuracy of the personal data; processing is unlawful but you oppose erasure; we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of our processing, but you require personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; and you have objected to processing, pending the verification of that objection. Where processing has been restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your personal data. However, we will only otherwise process it: with your consent; for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person; or for reasons of important public interest.

 **9.7.  **You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis for the processing is that the processing is necessary for: the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of any official authority vested in us; or the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. If you make such an objection, we will cease to process the personal information unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

 **9.10.  **To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal data is:

 **9.10.1  **consent; or

 **9.10.2  **that the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract and such processing is carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive your personal data from us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. However, this right does not apply where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.

 **9.11.  **To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.
