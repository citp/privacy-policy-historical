      - Cookies: We store cookies on your PC to  keep track of your Account and it is not shared with other companies.</p><br>
  <br>
     <p> We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to  complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties  except to the extent necessary to complete that order. Once you've clicked on  an advertisement and have left our Website, our Privacy Policy no longer  applies and you must read the privacy policy of the advertiser to see how your  personal information will be handled on their site. <br>
       <br>
      We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses  are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.  Information you submit on our website will not be used for this purpose unless  you fill out the registration form.<br>
      <br>

  <br>
     <p style="font-size:14px;"> Our Commitment to Children's Privacy: </p>
    <p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is  especially important. When a child under 18 years of age signs up we will not  collect the Email address without the permission of the Parent or Legal  Guardian and we will collect the other items listed above. We do not collect anything  else. If a child under 18 years of age wants to post information on our website  or chat with other players, we will require that they do not disclose any  personal information such as the real name, address, phone number and anything  that can be used to contact the child.<br>
      <br>
      We ask that you educate your child to never give out email, name, address, and  phone or pager information without parents consent. Tell them to always notify  a parent OR guardians, when they feel threatened, or are asked for any personal  information.</p> <br>
  <br>
      <p style="font-size:14px;">Our Commitment to Data Security </p>
    <p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain  data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place  appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and  secure the information we collect online. For visitors to our website, we look  at the IP address to decide if we can grant access. We may deny access to  identified violators of our terms of use, those who violated our privacy  policies and those from countries we do not have rights to publish some of our  games. We keep every IP address in a log file that is also used for marketing  research.</p><br>
        <br>
      <p style="font-size:14px;">How You Can Access or Correct Your  Information </p>
    <p>You can access all your personally  identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by accessing your  account or by filling out the proper forms on the Official Website. We use this  procedure to better safeguard your information. <br>
    </p><br>

    <p>You can correct factual errors in your  personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows  error. 
    </p><br>

    <p>To protect your privacy and security, we  will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access  or making corrections.
      We will disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that such  disclosures are required by law, including, for example, to comply with a court  order or subpoena, or will help to enforce our Terms of Use; enforce contest,  sweepstakes, promotions, and/or game rules; protect your safety or security,  including the safety and security of property that belongs to you; and/or,  protect the safety and security of our Web sites.<br>
