Our Commitment to Children's Privacy: 

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important.

If a child under 18 years of age wants to post information on our website or chat with other players, we will require that they do not disclose any personal information such as the real name, address, phone number and anything that can be used to contact the child.

We ask that you educate your child to never give out email, name, address, and phone or pager information without parents consent. Tell them to always notify a parent OR guardians, when they feel threatened, or are asked for any personal information.

Our Commitment to Data Security 

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. For visitors to our website, we look at the IP address to decide if we can grant access. We may deny access to identified violators of our terms of use, those who violated our privacy policies and those from countries we do not have rights to publish some of our games. We keep every IP address in a log file that is also used for marketing research.
