# Enounce, Incorporated - Time Scale Modification of Audio : Privacy Policy

**Privacy Policy**

Enounce, Incorporated is committed to your privacy and has developed this privacy statement to notify you of what personally identifiable information of yours or third party personally identification is collected from you, how this information is used and what choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information. 

**Information Collection and Use**  
Enounce, Incorporated collects information from our users at several different points on our web site, on product order forms, and through product registration. Enounce, Incorporated is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. Enounce, Incorporated won't share, license or sell data to third parties. Enounce, Incorporated will not give e-mail names to any of our partners and affiliates. 

**Registration**  
In some cases a user must register to use our software products. During registration a user is required to give their contact information (such as name and email address). This information is used solely for the purposes of customer support or to contact the user about software upgrades only for the product they have registered. At the time of registration a user may indicate that they do not want to be contacted with any news or notices.

**Order**  
We request information from the user on our order form. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and billing address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user. 

**Log Files**  
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

**Sharing**  
We will only share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. We use an outside credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. This company does not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 

**Links**  
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Enounce Incorporated is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 

**Security**  
This web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the web site, your information is protected both on-line and off-line. When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information on-line, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices or on servers within our control. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment. If you have any questions about the security at our web site, please submit a request using our [Customer Service Form](https://web.archive.org/web/20030622065959id_/http%3A//enounce.com/contact/service.shtml). 

**Choice/Opt-out**  
Users who do not want to receive information about our products have this option at the time they register their product. Users who no longer wish to receive information about our products may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to any email with unsubscribe in the subject line of the email or contacting us using our [Customer Service Form](https://web.archive.org/web/20030622065959id_/http%3A//enounce.com/contact/service.shtml).

**Notification of Changes**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
