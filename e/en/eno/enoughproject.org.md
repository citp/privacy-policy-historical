A cookie is a small piece of information that a website can store on a computer and later use to recognize a user. The purpose of cookies is to enhance your ability to receive the information you want. The Parties may use cookies to enhance the experience of users. A session cookie expires when a user closes the browser in which a website was viewed. As with all cookies, users can personalize their browser settings to reject session cookies.

**IP Addresses And Log File Data**

IP addresses are ID numbers for the location of your computer or network on the internet. Log files are recordings of the traffic to and from a server. The servers hosting the website for Enough log IP addresses for systems administration and troubleshooting. We track page hits in the  
aggregate to track the popularity of pages that people visit. With that information we can improve the quality of the site.

**Children's Privacy**

American Progress is concerned about the safety and privacy of children online. Because of this, we will make all efforts to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). COPPA and its accompanying FTC regulations establish United States federal law that protects the privacy of children using the Internet. We do not and will not knowingly contact or collect personal information from children under 13. Our site is not intended to solicit information of any kind from children under 13, and we will develop our site with the capacity to block acceptance of information from children under 13 whenever age-related information is requested.

It is possible that by fraud or deception by others we may receive information given to us or pertaining to children under 13. If we are notified of this, as soon as we verify the information, we will immediately obtain parental consent or else delete the information from our servers. If you want to notify us of our receipt of information by children under 13, please do so by e-mailing us at [progress@amprog.org.](mailto:progress@amprog.org)

**Security**

American Progress has measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of visitor personally identifiable information that is under our control. For example, only select staff and contracted individuals have access to personally identifiable information provided by visitors to non-public areas of our sites. We use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving sensitive personal and financial data from our site. Please note, however, that security breaches can occur even if reasonable steps are taken to prevent such breaches; for example, we cannot guarantee that information provided through our sites will not be illegally accessed on our servers or intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. Please contact us if you believe there has been any breach of the security of our sites.

**Please Note**

American Progress plans to regularly update and add new features to the website for Enough. Because of this, American Progress expects to revise this privacy policy as the site develops. Such amendments will be posted in the privacy policy section of the site. You can determine whether privacy policy has been modified since your last visit by checking the "Last updated" legend at the top of the policy. As stated above, the spirit of this policy will be maintained. American Progress may link to other like-minded websites, but is not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of those websites. Additionally, American Progress and its affiliates have separate content and privacy policies for their websites, which you should consult when accessing areas of their websites.
