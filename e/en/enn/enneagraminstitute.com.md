# Privacy Policy — The Enneagram Institute

**The Enneagram Institute**  
 **Privacy Policy**  

This notice describes the Privacy Policy of Enneagram Personality Types, Inc., also known as The Enneagram Institute (“EI”). By using the EI website (“Website” or “Site”), you are accepting the terms described in this Privacy Policy. At any time, the terms may be modified or updated without direct notification to users of the Site. If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise this statement to reflect the changes and revise the effective date.

Your use of the Website is also directed by our Terms of Use. If, after reviewing this policy, you have any questions or privacy concerns, please contact us by email at support@enneagraminstitute.com. 

**Data Collection and Usage Tracking**  
The Website does not collect personally identifiable information unless you voluntarily and knowingly provide it to us.  When you voluntarily provide it, we receive and store the information you provide to us. Further information on the collection and sharing of information you provide to us is included in later sections of this Privacy Policy. 

When you use the Website, EI automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser or mobile platform, including your location, IP address, and cookie information.  An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computing device when you use the Internet. Cookies are alphanumerical identifiers that are transferred to your computing device’s hard drive through your web browser or mobile platform. Cookies allow our systems to identify the computing device and your browser. IP addresses may be used to help diagnose problems with our server, administer the Website, analyze trends, track users' movement, gather broad demographic information for aggregate use in order for us to improve the Website, and deliver customized, personalized content.  We reserve the right to use cookies and analyze web logs. We may also use third-party services and tools such as Google Analytics, which may provide EI with other information about your use of the Website, but cannot be used to identify you.  These tools help us to understand traffic patterns and ascertain if there are problems with, or opportunities to improve, the Website.  We treat this data as non-Personal Information, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. Unless otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, EI only uses this data in aggregate form.

 **Collection of Personal Information**  
If you create an account on the Website, you will create user credentials such as a user ID and password.  All passwords are encrypted before being stored in our database.  We will only send you your password via an email in response to a specific request for a password reminder associated with the email address that you provide. 

If you purchase any products or services through the Website, your purchase will be processed through a secure third party payment processing system. EI does not store any of your financial information, including credit card numbers. 

**Sharing of Personal Information**  
EI shall have the right to release to third parties the personal information you provide: (1) to comply with valid legal requirements such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order; or (2) in special cases, such as in response to a physical threat to you or others, to protect property or defend or assert legal rights. In the event that EI is legally compelled to disclose your personal information to a third party, we will attempt to notify you unless doing so would violate the law or court order. 

**Sharing of Non-Personal Information**  
EI shall have the right to share non-Personal information, including aggregated information indicating general Website usage trends or activity, with third parties. 

**Sharing of Test Results**  
If you take an Enneagram test, such as the Riso-Hudson Enneagram Type Indicator (RHETI) test, or another personality-typing test, on the Website, and your test is administered through your employer or consulting organization, your results will be shared directly with the test administrator. In no event will EI share your personally-identifiable test results with anyone except you or the authorized test administrator for your organization. 

**Protecting Children**  
EI will not knowingly collect any information from individuals under the age of thirteen. The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) protects children under the age of thirteen from the online collection of personal information. Learn more about COPPA on the Federal Trade Commission’s website at www.ftc.gov.

 **Linking and Framing to Other Websites and Websites**  
The Website displays links and frames to other sites. Once you enter another website, or a portion of another site is framed within our Website, you agree that EI is not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites. EI encourages you to look for and review the privacy statements of each and every website that you visit.

EI makes no representation, warranty or endorsement, express or implied, as to any of the information, services, products or messages on any other websites which may be accessed through the Website. In particular, these links and frames are provided for convenience only and are not intended as an endorsement by EI of the organization or individual operating the website or a warranty or endorsement of any type regarding the website or the information, services, products or messages posted on or available from such website.

 **E-Communications from EI**  
EI will periodically send you emails or other electronic communications regarding the EI Website. These electronic communications will be sent to the email address that you provide. Should you wish to cease receiving these electronic communications, you can opt out via the instructions provided by EI.

EI will never send you an email requesting your password, credit card number, or social security number. If you receive a message that looks like it is from EI, but asks you for your credit card number or social security number, it is a fraudulent email, or “phish”. We recommend you report it to the proper authorities.
