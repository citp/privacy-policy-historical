### 2\. How We Collect Information

We collect information from you when you provide it to us directly, such as via an online form on our website or when you summit your support ticket to our CS team through http://support.enmasse.com/games. And also we and third parties use certain technologies described below to collect information to deliver excellent experiences.

#### A. Cookies and Other Similar Tracking Technologies

Cookies are small text pieces of data that online services you use place on your device for record-keeping purposes and stored on your Internet browser. We use cookies and similar technologies to help us understand things like what web pages, features or ads you view and what games you play. This information helps us keep track of your purchased records, measure the effectiveness of our advertising, make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly and otherwise help enhance your user experience. You can disable cookies, limit the types of cookies you allow, or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. Please refer to [http://www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/) or the guidance provided by your individual web browser if you'd like help in managing your cookie preferences.

We use other technologies for similar purposes as a cookie. We use Internet log files (which contain technical data such as your IP address) to monitor traffic on our services, troubleshoot technical problems, detect and prevent fraud and enforce our User Agreement.

#### B. Analytics Technologies

We use our own game servers and internal and third party analytic technologies to collect information about how you use our services, your device and the health of our services.

For instance, En Masse may collect and store data from your device when you use our services. This information includes technical and related information about your device info (such as operating system information and IP Address), information about your feature usage, gameplay and usage statistics. If you participate in online services, En Masse also may collect, use, store, transmit and publicly display statistical data regarding game play (including scores, rankings and accomplishments), or identify content that is created and shared by you with other players.

#### C. Advertisement Serving Technologies

Some of our services employ advertisement serving technologies that use cookies and other similar technologies like identifiers to deliver offers to you. The ads can be tailored to your interests. For instance, you may be presented with an offer for a game we think you might enjoy. Or if you express interest in a game, you might be offered an advertisement later for that game or similar services on En Masse or 3rd party’s web sites.

The 3rd parties’ services via their web sites collect and use information under their own privacy policies.

These technologies of the 3rd parties collect and use information so we can serve appropriate advertising to you and help track results and measure effectiveness. In addition to identifiers, this information includes:

  * Advertisements served and the location of the ad;
  * Domain type, IP address; and
  * Advertisement response for target marketing.



The 3rd party companies may combine the information collected in the context of delivering an ad to you via our Services with other information they have independently collected across their websites. 

To learn more about some of these ad networks' practices, or to opt out of third party targeted advertising, you can visit [ https://www.networkadvertising.org](https://www.networkadvertising.org/), <https://www.aboutads.info/choices/>, <http://youradchoices.ca/>, or [https://www.youronlinechoices.eu](https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/). Note that opting out does not mean you won't see ads; it just means that the advertising you see may be less relevant to your interests.

#### D. Anti-Cheat and Fraud Prevention Technologies

En Masse strives to provide a safe and fair gaming environment for all players. When you log in to one of our services, set up an En Masse Account or make purchases, we or third parties may use cookies and similar technologies, or collect data about your machine or device, to create a machine "fingerprint" or "hash" of your machine components, for fraud prevention, security and authentication purposes.

We might employ third parties located in and outside of your country of residence (including outside of the European Economic Area (EEA)) to collect or process personal information on our behalf for various reasons, such as maintaining our service, offering promotion/marketing or sending emails.
