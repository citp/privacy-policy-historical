###  Last Updated May 14, 2012 

##  **Our Commitment To Privacy**

Your privacy is important to us and maintaining your trust is our priority. To ensure that your privacy is protected, we provide this notice which explains our online information practices as well as the decisions you may make regarding how your information is collected and used. 

##  **Our Principles**

Ensighten adheres to industry best practice privacy principles outlined by the [Web Analytics Association Code of Ethics](http://www.webanalyticsassociation.org/?page=codeofethics) with respect to the data collection practices at our websites; including the site that you are now visiting and the site that each of our clients uses to access the data we collect on the client's behalf pursuant to the client's instructions. Our fundamental privacy principles incorporate the guidelines suggested by the Federal Trade Commission for web sites that collect personally identifying information - Notice, Choice, Access, and Security - which are discussed below. 

**Notice**  – Ensighten is committed to making our data collection practices readily available to you so that you can make informed decisions about your activities at our websites. 

**Choice**  – Ensighten provides you with the opportunity to elect not to participate in our data collection activities. 

**Access**  – We provide all visitors to our websites with the opportunity to review, modify, and delete any personally identifiable information that has previously been provided. 

##  **What We Collect and How We Use It**

When you visit this website, we collect certain non-personally-identifiable information such as your IP address, referring web site, what pages you visited, and the time that you visited. We will also collect any personally identifiable information that you may send to us or provide to us on our forms (such as Resume Submission or Request for Information). We use this information in connection with fulfilling your request, for our own marketing purposes, or to consider your application for employment. We may also provide this information to our marketing partners so that you may receive marketing information from them, but only if you affirmatively request that we do so. Finally, we may forward to our vendors information that you provide to us, but only for the limited purpose of providing a service to us, such as fulfilling on our behalf a request for information about Ensighten. 

When our client users access their data via our secure web interface, we collect information about the way they use our Services, such as their IP address, the type of browser they are using, and the numbers and durations of site visits. We also collect user ID, username, and password. We use the information that we collect to improve the way that we provide our Services, to relay administrative information, and to verify login information. As we continue to develop our business, we may sell certain of our assets. In such transactions, visitor information likely will be one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the event that Ensighten, Inc. or substantially all of its assets is acquired, our visitor information may be an asset that is reviewed and transferred. Also, as with the data we collect on behalf of our clients, we reserve a limited right to disclose any data we collect at our sites if required by law or valid order of a court or other governmental authority.

##  **Consumer Privacy**

When you use websites owned by our customers that are using our services or products, you may also be providing certain additional types of information other than those described above, such as tracking tags and cookies. This information is used only to the extent necessary to provide our services to the website you are visiting for the duration of your visit and we do not access, store, or use this information in any other way. In all cases, whether this information belongs to either you or to the owner of the website you are visiting depends upon the individual privacy practices of that website. You should always check the individual privacy policy of each website you visit before providing any information.  Regardless of whether you or the owner of the applicable website own your data, we make no claim to your information and cannot and will not be responsible for it.
