# Privacy Policy - Enbridge Gas Distribution

## Enbridge Gas Distribution Privacy Policy

Effective January 1, 2004; date of last revision June 1, 2016

### Our Commitment

This Privacy Policy is based on the federal Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act ("PIPEDA"). It governs the commercial relationship between Enbridge Gas Distribution Inc. ("Enbridge Gas Distribution", "we", "us" etc.) and individuals who are our customers or potential customers ("you").

At Enbridge Gas Distribution, we are committed to providing excellent service and to ensuring that our relationship with you is conducted with integrity and in a responsible, fair, honest and ethical manner. Consistent with these objectives we maintain high standards of confidentiality with respect to the personal information in our possession.

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or wish to access the personal information in our possession about you, please contact our Privacy Officer.

### 1.0 Collection, Use and Disclosure of Personal Information

### 1.1 What personal information do we collect?

Personal information is information about you as an individual customer or potential customer and relates specifically to you (such as your name and address). When you first become a customer or whenever you require or renew a service or product from us, we need to collect some of your personal information. However, the personal information that we collect from you is always limited to the purposes that we have identified to you.

### 1.2 Purposes: Why do we collect personal information?

We ask you to provide us with your personal information for the following purposes:

  * to provide natural gas and related energy services
  * to bill and collect payment for products and services 
  * to meet legal and regulatory requirements relating to the services or products 
  * to provide information about using energy safely and efficiently and to understand energy needs and preferences and provide information about energy services or products that may be of interest
  * to trace overpayments and return credits to the appropriate person



If we identify a new purpose for the personal information that we have collected from you, we will provide notice of these new purposes in this Privacy Policy. In cases where the new purpose is not consistent with the original purpose, we will ask you for your consent before using your personal information for the new purpose.

### 1.3 Consent: Why do we require your permission?

We collect, use or disclose your personal information only with your consent. Your consent may be express or implied, and you may give it to us in writing, verbally, electronically, or through your authorized representative. If you use our products and services, we consider that you have implied your consent for us to collect, use and disclose your personal information for the purposes identified above. You may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal and regulatory restrictions and reasonable notice.

In order to determine whether a person has implied consent to access gas account information, EGD may ask and confirm answers to a number of questions about account details. A customer that wishes to restrict account access can make that request through the EGD call center.

We do not provide or sell customer lists to any outside company for marketing, solicitation or any other such purpose. We will not use or disclose your personal information without your consent except in the following circumstances:

  * When required by law or law enforcement purposes.
  * For an emergency that threatens life, health or security.
  * To bill for or collect a debt that you owe us or a third party on whose behalf we provide billing and collection services, or to evaluate your credit worthiness.
  * To a third party that we have contracted with to provide you with services on our behalf or to assist us in understanding your energy needs and preferences.



### 2.0 Protecting Your Personal Information

### 2.1 Security safeguards and employee awareness

Keeping your personal information confidential and secure is a priority for us. In order to ensure protection of your personal information and right to privacy, we have developed security procedures to safeguard and protect your personal information against loss, theft, unauthorized disclosure, copying, and unauthorized use or modification.

Our employees are trained to maintain the security and confidentiality of your personal information.

### 2.2 Agents and third party service providers

Enbridge Gas Distribution contracts with agents, contractors and other third parties for services related to gas distribution, such as billing, call centre support, maintenance and energy safety and efficiency information. From time to time, we may need to share some of your personal information with these third parties further to the purposes identified above and in order to serve your needs and in some instance such third parties may communicate directly with you. To a limited extent, Enbridge Gas Distribution contracts with foreign service providers for services such as data processing. These third parties may be required to disclose personal information in response to valid demands or requests from governments, regulators, courts and law enforcement authorities.

"Any third party that we share your personal information with is contractually bound to keep the information confidential and secure and to refrain from using it" in any way other than is necessary to perform the services.

  


### 3.0 Your Rights

### 3.1 Accessing your personal information

You have the right to ask whether we hold any personal information about you and to see that information. We will respond to your request for access within 30 days of the request being made.

You could refuse to allow us to obtain, use or share your personal information or you could also withdraw a previously given consent at any time. However, by doing so, depending on the situation, you may be limiting or even preventing our ability to provide you with the service or product you desire.

### 3.2 Requesting an update or correction

If you believe that any of your personal information is inaccurate, you may ask us to correct it. We will respond to your request to update or correct your personal information within 30 days of the request being made.
