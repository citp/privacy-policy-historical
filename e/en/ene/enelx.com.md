Information Collected Automatically and Cookies

Enel X North America’s website(s) collect certain information about you automatically, including the domain that referred you to our website, the type of browser and computer operating system you use, navigational information, time and date of visit, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, and cookies (as described in more detail below).

What are cookies?

A cookie is a small file that attaches to a computer or web browser when accessing or viewing a website. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies are used during a single website visit and are automatically deleted from your computer when you close your browser. Persistent cookies are used to track website activity over a longer period, and remain on your browser or computer until either you choose to delete them or they expire.

How does Enel X North America use cookies?

Enel X North America uses persistent cookies in several places on our website so we can pre-populate forms to improve your ease of use. For example, the information provided during a brochure download is captured so that you do not need to enter it again when requesting additional documents. Enel X North America may also use persistent cookies to collect analytical information about how visitors use our website. For example, we may measure website usage, access to online services, and the level of interest in particular products. We use this information to improve our service and provide a better experience for visitors to our website.

When we post videos, third parties may use local shared objects, known as “Flash Cookies,” to store your preferences for volume control or to personalize certain video features. Flash Cookies are different from browser Cookies because of the amount and type of data and how the data is stored.

Do I have to accept cookies?

Our website honors “Do Not Track” requests or similar signals transmitted by your browser. Some sections of our website (e.g. Press, Investors, Jobs, and EnergySMART pages) use cookies to retain your personal preferences for our website. If you use a “Do Not Track” or “Disable Cookies” feature on your Web browser, your browser will not remember your personal preferences when you return to the website (e.g. downloadable forms will not be pre-filled). If you do not accept our cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of our Solutions. For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer or mobile device and you may need to log in every time you visit our Solutions.

Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash Cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash Cookies, click here:  _<https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html>_.

Accessing, Updating, and Deleting Information

You may request access, corrections, or deletions of your information by contacting  _[support@enel.com](mailto:support@enel.com)_. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request. For your protection, we may only implement requests with respect to the personal data associated with the particular email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request. Please note that if you request deletion of your information, we may be required by law to keep such information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements). When we delete any information, it will be deleted from the active database, but may remain in our archives. We may also retain your information for fraud or similar purposes.

Enel X North America Solutions: Information Collection and Use

In order for you to use or access a Solution, you must expressly consent to Enel X North America’s access to certain information in order to provide you with the applicable Solution. Enel X North America may collect information from the Solution meters installed on your site. If you received our Solution through a utility company (“Utility”), we may receive information from your Utility. If you received our Solution through one of our distributors or resellers, including but not limited to, one of our affiliates that market our Solution, we may receive information from such party. In addition, we collect any information which you provide to us directly. Information collected through the foregoing methods includes your customer contact information, financial information, account information, customer metadata, energy costs, energy behavioral analytics information, and energy usage and performance data.

Analytics

We use third party analytics services (“Analytics Services”), to help analyze how users use our websites and our Solutions. For example, we may measure website usage, access to online services, and the level of interest in particular products. We use this information to improve our service and provide a better experience for visitors to our website and users of our Solutions. The information generated by the Cookies or other technologies about your use of our websites (the “Analytics Information”) is transmitted to the Analytics Services. The Analytics Services use Analytics Information to compile reports on user activity. The Analytics Services may also transfer the Analytics Information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process Analytics Information on their behalf. Each Analytics Service’s ability to use and share Analytics Information is restricted by such Analytics Service’s Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. By using our websites, you consent to the processing of data about you by Analytics Services in the manner and for the purposes set out above. For a full list of our Analytics Services, please contact us at  _[support@enel.com](mailto:support@enel.com)_.

Our website also makes use of Remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting, and DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration. Enel X North America and third party vendors, such as Google, may use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to (i) inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to our website and (ii) report how your ad impressions, uses of ad services, and interactions with the foregoing are related to your visits to the website. In addition, Enel X North America may utilize Google Analytics data, including but not limited to, geographic, demographic, and interest reporting information to recognize and understand user preferences; make improvements to our website, products, and services; and for other business purposes that will allow us to better serve you.

Pixel Tags

In addition, we use “Pixel Tags” (also referred to as clear gifs, web beacons, or web bugs). Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies, that are used to track online movements of Web users. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in web pages. Pixel Tags also allow us to send e-mail messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users.
