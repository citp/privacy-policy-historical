# Privacy Policy | EnergySage News | EnergySage

EnergySage is committed to protecting the privacy of its customers and third-party vendors (“Users”). The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to describe how we meet that commitment to our Users in practice. This Privacy Policy describes the types of information we may collect, how we may use that information, the steps we take to protect it, the circumstances under which we may disclose or transfer it, and the choices you have regarding submitting and maintaining your information.

By visiting EnergySage.com (the “Site”), Users are consenting to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is subject to change. If you are a returning User or a regular User of the Site, EnergySage recommends that you review the Privacy Policy to be sure you are familiar with its current terms.

We encourage you to contact us if you have any questions or concerns about the privacy or security of your information.

## I. non-personal Information

Certain non-personal information is collected from Users automatically when they access the Site. This non-personal information includes your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address — a numeric label that your Internet service provider assigns to your computer each time you connect to the Internet. Your IP address does not contain any personal information (such as your name, your mailing address, or your email address). Your IP address facilitates communication between your computer and the Site, and helps us to administer the Site.

Additional non-personal information is collected from Users through the use of “cookies.” A cookie is an alphanumeric file that is delivered by a web site to your computer, and is stored by your web browser. Cookies can be used to verify the identity of a source of information, to store web site preferences, to store certain items of information so that they can be accessed later on (“shopping cart” contents, for example), or for any other purpose that depends on retrieving stored data. We use cookies to identify your computer whenever you access the Site. This facilitates and enhances your use of the content, resources and services provided to you at the Site. We also use cookies to gather information about the number of Users who visit the Site, how frequently they visit, and the pages that Users access. This information helps us to improve the appearance and content of the Site, and improve the functionality of Site resources. These cookies do not gather information that identifies you personally.

Cookies may remain on your hard drive after you leave the Site. You may modify the settings of your web browser to prevent cookies from being installed on your computer. If you decline to have your web browser accept cookies, however, you may not be able to access or utilize certain resources or services that are available at the Site.

EnergySage may also use other technology that is standard to the Internet, such as web beacons and other similar technologies, to track User visits to the Site. These technologies also help us to gather information about the number of Users who visit the Site, whether and how they arrived at the Site as the result of a web search, the pages that Users access, etc. This information also helps us to improve the appearance and content of the Site, and enhance the functionality of Site resources.

Certain resources at the Site, if you opt to use them, will require you to provide information about the physical attributes of your home or business, including its location (by zip code), the systems that are used to heat and cool it, the fuels that those systems consume (oil, gas, propane, etc.), the quantities of those fuels that are consumed, the amount of electricity you use, and so on. This information, while it is detailed and specific, cannot be used to identify you personally and does not constitute Personal Information. If you wish to utilize these Site resources, however, you will be required to enroll as a Registered User and to provide EnergySage with certain Personal Information, as described in Section II below, under the caption “Personal Information.” EnergySage will not require you to provide us with the identifying numbers of your utility accounts, or any other identifying numbers that may be associated with them, such as your meter number(s).

Whenever a User’s non-personal information is used or is stored together with the User’s Personal Information, it will be treated as Personal Information.

## II. personal Information

Personal Information is data that can be used to identify individual Users. It is not necessary for you to provide EnergySage with any Personal Information in order to read content that is publicly available at the Site. If you wish to use the resources and services that are available at the Site (calculators, dashboards, user forums and web logs (“blogs”), reviews of installers and other third-party vendors, hosted applications, etc.) you must, however, enroll as a Registered User and select a user name (a “User ID”) and password. When you become a Registered User at the Site you will be asked to provide EnergySage with certain Personal Information that is necessary to complete your registration. That Personal Information includes your name and your email address.

If you decide to purchase a renewable or clean energy system for your home or business, and wish to be contacted by one of the installers or third-party vendors who are affiliated with EnergySage, you will be required to provide your name, your address and your telephone number so that you may be contacted. This Personal Information will be shared only with the third-party vendor(s) or installer(s) that you yourself have selected, and only at your request. Moreover, if you opt to provide Personal Information in order to be contacted by one or more third-party vendors or installers, those vendors and installers may only use that Personal Information for the sole purpose of contacting you in response to your request, and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.

EnergySage employs payment intermediary services such as PayPal™ and Google Checkout™, and does not request or store any of your financial information, such as your bank, debit or credit card accounts.

You may be asked to provide Personal Information if and when you contact EnergySage by telephone or by mail, depending on your reason for contacting us.

## III. Use of Your Information

As a Registered User of the Site you will be able to use the resources and services that are available at the Site (calculators, dashboards, user forums and web logs (“blogs”), reviews of installers and other third-party vendors, hosted applications, etc.), The information that you provide when you register will be used to identify you as the source of content that you post to the Site, whether in a forum of blog, or any other area of the Site that is accessible to Registered Users.

If you are a Registered User and own a renewable or clean energy system, you may opt to allow other Registered Users to contact you with questions regarding your experience selecting, installing, and maintaining it. If you do opt to be contacted by other EnergySage users—it is not required—EnergySage will not divulge your email address to other Users. Instead, EnergySage will allow such Registered Users to post their question in an online forum, and to direct their question to you using an “alias” email address that will be forwarded to the email address you provided to EnergySage. The email that you receive will contain a link to the forum where you can publicly post your reply to the Registered User—avoiding the need for you to reply directly to the Registered User via email and disclosing your email address.

EnergySage may also use your Personal Information to send you notices regarding changes to our Terms of Use, this Privacy Policy, and other policies relating to the Site. You may not opt out of receiving these communications when you become a Registered User. You may opt out of receiving other emails from EnergySage that may contain notices about content and features that become available at the Site.

In the future EnergySage may also offer home- and business-owners that own renewable or clean energy systems the opportunity to monitor both the efficiency of their systems and the financial savings that those systems accrue. Should this functionality become available, home- and business-owners that own renewable or clean energy systems may wish to become Registered Users in order to use EnergySage dashboards to monitor their renewable or clean energy systems. All renewable and clean energy systems that are monitored by EnergySage will be mapped by zip code. The specific addresses where monitored renewable and clean energy systems are located will not mapped. The purpose of mapping monitored systems by zip code is to provide Users with information concerning the types of renewable and clean energy systems that have been successfully installed by their neighbors. Information about each mapped renewable or clean energy system will include the type of system installed (for example, whether it is a solar photovoltaic or a combined heat and power system), the size and capacity of the system, the manufacturer(s) of the equipment that was installed, the name of the contractor(s) who installed the system, and whether the system was installed in a home or business.

If you own a renewable or clean energy system that is monitored in the future by EnergySage, you will be asked to allow EnergySage to aggregate data regarding the output of your system with data received from all other monitored systems for display at the Site. The purpose of aggregating this data will be to track at the Site the total amount of energy that has been generated, the total amount of money that has been saved, and the total amount of carbon emissions that have been avoided, collectively, by the EnergySage community.

## IV. DISCLOSURES of your information

As stated in Section II above, captioned “Personal Information,” you may ask to be contacted by one of the installers or third-party vendors who are affiliated with EnergySage. Your Personal Information will be shared only with the third-party vendor(s) or installer(s) that you yourself have selected, and only at your request. EnergySage will not make any other disclosures of your Personal Information to third parties unless we are required to do so by law, or to enforce our Terms of Use or another legal agreement, or upon your written request.

From time to time EnergySage may create, purchase or sell business subsidiaries. EnergySage may disclose your Personal Information to any subsidiary that it creates or purchases. In addition, Personal Information constitutes a business asset that is transferrable in any sales transaction involving business subsidiaries. Whether EnergySage creates, acquires or sells a business subsidiary, any Personal Information that is shared or sold will remain subject to the promises made in the Privacy Policy then current, unless Users consent otherwise.

## V. correcting your personal information — updating communication options

2.    via email sent to [admin@energysage.com](mailto:admin@energysage.com); or

## VI. protection of personal information

EnergySage has developed and implemented a comprehensive information security program that contains administrative, technical, and physical safeguards that are intended to protect Users’ Private Information from disclosure (the “Security Program”). One or more EnergySage employees have been designated to maintain the Security Program. Among other things, the Security Program has been implemented to identify and assess reasonably foreseeable internal and external risks to the security, confidentiality, and/or integrity of any electronic, paper or other record that contains Personal Information. The Security Program also represents an ongoing effort to evaluate and improve, where necessary, the effectiveness of the current safeguards for limiting such risks, and provides for the development of security policies for employees to follow when storing, accessing and transporting records that contain Personal Information. EnergySage reviews the scope of the measures contained in the Security Program at least annually, and whenever there is a material change in business practices that may reasonably implicate the security or integrity of records containing Personal Information.

The Site includes User forums and blogs where you can post information and comments, and pose and answer questions. When you post content in a forum or to a blog, any Personal Information that you include in your post is visible to and shared with other Users, and will be disclosed to them. You are solely responsible for any Personal Information that you choose to post in a forum or blog that is visible to other Users. Please be mindful of the information that you post in forums or blogs in order to avoid disclosing your own Personal Information, including your EnergySage User ID and password.

## VII. CHILDREN

If you are not yet 18 years old, you may only use the Site with the consent and involvement of a parent or guardian. If EnergySage becomes aware that it has obtained Personal Information from a child we know to be under 13 years of age, we will delete that information as soon as possible.

## VIII. third-party sites

The Site may contain links to third-party websites promoting products, and services. Information collected by such third parties at websites hosted by them, including Personal Information, is governed by and subject to their privacy practices, and not by this Privacy Policy. You are encouraged to learn about the privacy practices of those third parties.

## IX. privacy questions

We encourage you to contact us if you have any questions or concerns about the privacy or security of your information. You may submit your questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, or any other privacy matter, via email sent to [privacy@energysage.com](mailto:privacy@energysage.com).
