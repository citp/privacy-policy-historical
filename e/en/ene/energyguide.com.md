#### Our Commitment to Privacy

ENERGYguide.com has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to the privacy of our customers and the information that they provide us. ENERGYguide.com collects and processes information for specified legitimate purposes either directly on the ENERGYguide.com site or through a co-branded partner site (see Co-Branded Partner below). Neither we, nor our co-branded partners, will give away, trade, sell or release any information obtained from our customers. The following headings address how ENERGYguide.com and our co-branded partners gather and use information. 

#### IP Addresses and Cookies

ENERGYguide.com collects the user's IP address and any referring URL. The user's IP address is often not an address that can be traced to their machine, as most users do not employ static IP addresses. Rather, they connect through an ISP, a service that uses DHCP or a proxy server. In these cases, their IP address is not permanently bound to their machine. We use the IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer ENERGYguide.com. IP addresses are also used in aggregate form for traffic analysis. 

When a person visits the site, a cookie is created on the user's machine that stores that visitor's ENERGYguide.com user ID. The cookie is non-sessional and persists on the user's machine for one year at which point it expires. A second cookie is also created to hold session information. It expires as soon as the session terminates (after twenty minutes). ENERGYguide.com also utilizes cookies to track items placed in your shopping cart, deliver content specific to your interests and save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site (See also the Advertising section regarding 3rd party use of cookies on our site) . 

#### Registration Information

ENERGYguide.com's registration form requires users to provide contact information including at a minimum, name, ZIP code and email address. We use customer contact information from the registration form to send users information about our company. Users may opt-out of receiving such information. (see the choice/opt-out section below). 

ENERGYguide.com also asks for email address and ZIP code in order to contact the member and provide them with updates on savings and energy information. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings (see the choice/opt-out section below). 

#### Order Information

ENERGYguide.com uses an order form for customers to request and purchase information, products and services. We collect visitor's contact information (like their email address) and financial information (like their account or credit card numbers). Contact information from the order form is used to send orders to our customers. The customer's contact information is also used to contact members with special offers, site information, surveys to track their site experience and notifications of any site performance issues. Users may opt-out of receiving these mailings (see the choice/opt-out section below). Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services they purchase. 

In some cases we allow the user to signup directly on the Merchant or Content Partner. In this case we may ask for the user's contact information (like name, ZIP code and email address) and pass this over to the Partner. However, this information is only used for the primary purpose for which it was collected. 

In other cases ENERGYguide.com collects all signup info and retains it. In these cases information is either transmitted on a real-time basis or batched and sent to the Merchant or Content Partner on a daily basis.
