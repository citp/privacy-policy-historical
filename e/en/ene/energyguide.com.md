### Our Commitment to Privacy

Aclara Software has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to the privacy of users of our sites and the information that they provide us. Aclara Software collects and processes information for specified legitimate purposes either directly on the Aclara Software site or through a Partner site (see Co-Branded and Private Label Partners below). Neither we, nor our Co-Branded and Private Label partners, will give away, trade, sell or release any information obtained from our users. The following headings address how Aclara Software and our co-branded partners gather and use information. 

### Co-Branded and Private Label Partners

Aclara Software partners with other sites (e.g. utility sites) to provide energy-related content to their visitors in a Co-branded or Private Label relationship. You can identify that you are using a co-branded partner site by seeing a "Powered by Aclara Software" logo present within another party's site. In some cases the Aclara Software site is operated on a Private Label basis and no "Powered by" logo will appear. In either case, your information is only used for the primary purpose for which it was collected as described throughout this Privacy Statement.

### IP Addresses and Cookies

Aclara Software applications collect the user's IP address and any referring URL. The user's IP address is often not an address that can be traced to their machine, as most users do not employ static IP addresses. Rather, they connect through an Internet Service Provider, a service that uses DHCP or a proxy server and dynamically generates IP addresses. We use the IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to allocate load. IP addresses are also used in aggregate form for traffic analysis. When a person visits the site, a cookie is created on the user's machine that stores that visitor's user ID. The cookie persists on the user's machine for one year at which point it expires. A second cookie is also created to hold session information. It expires as soon as the session terminates (after twenty minutes). Aclara Software may utilize cookies to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit the site. 

### Registration Information

Aclara Software's registration forms require users to provide contact information including at a minimum, name, ZIP code and email address.
