'Personal information' is information or an opinion, in any form (whether true or not), about an identified individual or an individual who is reasonably identifiable.

At all times the collection of this information is obtained by lawful means in a manner that respects your privacy.

  * Direct Mail
  * Email

  * All Channels



Please provide your contact details for each of the channels you wish to stop getting marketing communications through. Note: these details are used to ensure you are not included in direct marketing lists, so please make sure your information is complete and accurate.

##  How do we make sure the information we hold about you is current?

We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we collect, use and disclose is accurate, up to date, complete and relevant.

##  Do we hold sensitive information about you?

We will only collect sensitive information about you with your consent (unless we are otherwise allowed or required by law to collect that information). Sensitive information includes information about your health, your race or ethnic origin and religious beliefs.

You may wish to provide to us with sensitive information about you from time to time, for example where you have particular energy requirements due to special medical needs or where you wish to apply for a government concession available in relation to special medical needs. If you or someone living at your premises requires life support equipment, you should tell us (and provide confirmation from a medical practitioner) so that we may register your premises as having life support equipment, in which case certain restrictions on disconnecting your premises will apply. We may be required by law to disclose this information to certain entities, for example to your distributor.

##  Do we record your phone calls to us?

Yes, there are two instances where your phone calls may be monitored. The first is for training, service quality control and compliance purposes, where we may record and monitor telephone calls between you and us.

The second concerns calls to traders in our energy trading business. These calls may be recorded and archived.

##  How can you correct your information?

Please let us know if the personal information we have about you is inaccurate, incomplete or out of date and we will take reasonable steps to correct it, including any information relating to credit.

##  How can you get access to your information?

You may request details of the personal information, including information related to credit, we hold about you and we will generally provide you with access subject to some exceptions permitted by law. For example, if providing this access may disclose information about another person, or may disclose commercially sensitive information, we may need to refuse to grant you access.

Charges may apply to cover the cost of us accessing and providing you with this information. If we cannot provide you access, we will provide a statement of our reasons.

##  How do we manage privacy issues about credit?

When you enter into a contract with us, we’ll collect and hold your name, address, date of birth and drivers' licence number. We may disclose this information to Veda Advantage and/or Dun & Bradstreet which are Credit Reporting Bureaus ( **CRBs** ) if we decide to do a credit check. You may contact the relevant CRB to obtain its policy on how it manages your credit-related personal information using the contact details below:

**Veda Advantage Information Services and Solutions Limited**

Phone: 1300 850 211

Mail: Attention: Public Access Division

Veda Advantage

PO Box 964

North Sydney NSW 2059

**Dun and Bradstreet (Australia) Pty Ltd**

Phone: 1300 734 806

Mail: Attention: Public Access Centre

Dun & Bradstreet Australia

PO Box 7405

St Kilda Rd VIC 3004

If you believe on reasonable grounds that you have been or are likely to be a victim of fraud, you can request CRB not to use or disclose credit reporting information about you. In addition, you can request the CRB not to use your credit reporting information for the purposes of pre-screening of direct marketing by a credit provider.

The CRB may include information that we provide to it in reports that they provide to other credit providers to assist them to assess your credit worthiness. If we do a credit check on you with CRB, the CRB will generate a credit score for you and make this available to us. We’ll use this information to help us assess your credit worthiness, and we will keep a record of whether you passed or failed the credit check (based on our credit criteria) but we will not keep the credit score generated for you by the CRB.

If you become our customer the identification information we collected from you, that you passed the credit check and any information about your credit defaults with us will be held in our customer database.

Some of our contractors to whom this information may be disclosed are located overseas, including in India, New Zealand, The Philippines, Fiji and the US.

If you don't become our customer, your identification will be held in our quotes database until such time as it is destroyed.

If, after reasonable follow up, you do not pay any outstanding amounts owed by you to us we may supply to the CRB with this information along with relevant personal information. This may include:

  * identification information about you
  * the fact that you have applied for credit and we are a credit provider to you
  * advice about payments more than 60 days overdue which are ‘in collection’ that we are permitted to report to the CRB
  * that, in our opinion, you have committed a serious credit infringement
  * that credit provided to you has been paid or otherwise discharged



Notification to the CRB that any of your outstanding payments are no longer overdue will only be made following payment of the outstanding amount including any accrued interest.

You’re entitled to access and seek the correction of the credit-related personal information that we hold. If you have a complaint about the handling of your credit-related personal information you can contact our Privacy Officer.

##  What if you disagree with our decision?

Where we make a decision about you or affecting you, you may ask us to explain the basis on which that decision was made, and you may ask to see the personal information (if any) on which our decision is based (see [How can you get access to your information?](http://www.energyaustralia.com.au/privacy#access-your-information)).
