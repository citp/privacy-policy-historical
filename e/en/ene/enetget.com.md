We may, however, share aggregate demographic statistics about members such as interests or occupations, but advertisers and third parties can never access your individual personal information. There are, however, exceptions about providing your personal information. These exceptions include:

  * when we respond to court orders or any orders from law enforcement or judicial governmental authorities, but only upon the receipt of appropriate documentation(s);
