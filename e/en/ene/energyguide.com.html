<h3>Our Commitment to Privacy</h3>

Aclara Software has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to the privacy of users of our sites and the information that they provide us. Aclara Software collects and processes information for specified legitimate purposes either directly on the Aclara Software site or through a Partner site (see Co-Branded and Private Label Partners below). Neither we, nor our Co-Branded and Private Label partners, will give away, trade, sell or release any information obtained from our users. The following headings address how Aclara Software and our co-branded partners gather and use 
information. <p></p>

 

<h3>Co-Branded and Private Label Partners</h3>

<p>Aclara Software partners with other sites (e.g. utility sites) to provide energy-related content to their visitors in a Co-branded or Private Label relationship. You can identify that you are using a co-branded partner site by seeing a "Powered by Aclara Software" logo present within another party's site.  In some cases the Aclara Software site is operated on a Private Label basis and no "Powered by" logo will appear.  In either case, your information is only used for the 
primary purpose for which it was collected as described throughout this Privacy Statement.</p> 

 

<h3>IP Addresses and Cookies</h3>

Aclara Software applications collect the user's IP address and any referring URL. The user's IP address is often not an address that can be traced to their machine, as most users do not employ static IP addresses. Rather, they connect through an Internet Service Provider, a 
service that uses DHCP or a proxy server and dynamically generates IP addresses. We use the IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to allocate load. IP addresses are also used in aggregate form for traffic analysis.

When a person visits the site, a cookie is created on the user's machine that stores that visitor's user ID. The cookie persists on the user's machine for one year at which point it expires. A second 
cookie is also created to hold session information. It expires as soon as the session terminates (after twenty minutes). Aclara Software may utilize cookies to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit the site. 

<h3>Registration Information</h3>

Aclara Software's registration forms require users to provide contact 
information including at a minimum, name, ZIP code and email address. We or our Co-Branded or Private Label Partner may use this contact information to send users information about the applications 
or other related information and to deliver surveys to track their site experiences and notifications of any site performance issues. Users may opt-out of receiving such information.  (See the choice/opt-out section below).

 <h3>Financial Information</h3>

Aclara Software does not collect any financial information.
 
<h3>Analysis Information</h3>

For sites that include energy and billing analysis, Aclara Software stores information that may or may not be personally identifiable, including data provided by the user through the various tools, calculators and other analytical content on the site. This information is collected for internal use only so that we may personalize the site and results for the user. This information is used anonymously at an aggregate level to analyze user data.

 

<h3>Contest Information</h3>

From time to time, Aclara Software or a Co-Branded or Private Label Partner may sponsor contests in which we ask visitors for contact information (such as their e-mail address). We utilize contact data to notify the contest winners. Users may opt-out of receiving 
future communications (see the choice/opt-out section below).  

<h3>Links</h3>

Aclara Software sites may contain links to other sites, and is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. We encourage users to read the privacy statements for any pages located on other sites.


<h3>Content Partners</h3>

On some sites, Aclara Software partners with other sites to provide content and to make product and service offers to visitors through "Powered By" relationships. You can identify that you are using a partner's content, etc…when you see a "Powered By" logo for such partners within the Aclara Software site. 


<h3>Choice/Opt-Out</h3>

Aclara Software offers users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from both our partners and us when we request information from them.  Aclara Software offers users the 
following options for removing their information from our database in order to stop receiving subsequent communications: 

<ul>

<li>	Upon registering or entering a contest, you are given the choice of participating in periodic mailings, and may choose to opt-out; </li>

<li>	You can send email to webmaster@aclara.com;</li>

<li>	All email communications include the option of opting out of future communications.</li>
</ul>

Aclara Software reserves the right to contact you for strictly administrative purposes if it becomes necessary for some unforeseen reason.

 
<h3>Security</h3>

Aclara Software sites have implemented a comprehensive set of security measures to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control. Our servers reside at a secure 
location provided by Verizon. These servers employ an all-inclusive implementation of Windows security measures that prevent unauthorized system access.  All customer information is conducted via encrypted data transfer methods. These measures are reviewed on a regular basis.  All Aclara Software employees are aware of these security procedures via internal education and are periodically briefed on any new security considerations.

 

<h3>Notification of Changes</h3>

Aclara Software reserves the right to change, modify or augment any or all parts of this privacy policy. Any changes will be posted immediately on this privacy page so that users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and, under specified situations, how we disclose it.  Any changes that may influence the use or storage of user information will first be proposed to all users via e-mail at which point each user will decide whether or not we continue to store 
and/or use their information.  Aclara Software will only use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
 

<h3>Correcting/Updating Information</h3>

If you need to correct, access or update pertinent personally 
Identifiable Information obtained through a Aclara Software-operated site, you can use the contact options listed above. 
 

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>

good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on one of our sites.
