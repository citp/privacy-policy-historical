##### Introduction

Resumes are deeply personal documents which reveal a lot about you. Enhancv values your privacy, so we've developed an easy to understand Privacy Policy that covers how we collect and use your information.

Depending on your relationship with Enhancv, this info may include usage information, log information, account or billing information, payment details, contact information. You can understand when we collect and how we treat each type of data in the sections below.

When we refer to “we” and “us”, we mean Enhancv Ltd. which controls the information collected when you use our services on the Enhancv platform (also called "service", “product” within this document) to create your resume (or, as better known in other parts of the world, a CV) or any other document.

Keep in mind we never share the information you provide with third parties, except for chosen partners that are used for the purpose of providing you with a stable and enjoyable experience when using Enhancv. We have tried to outline here the main points of how these partners and third party services collect and use data, but for the most detailed and up-to-date information you should review their own privacy policies.

You always remain in control of your data. You may edit or erase your data from our services at any time or ask us to update or erase information we store, as long as this erasure is not in conflict with any legal obligations we may hold to national and international regulators.

By providing us with your data, you warrant to us that you are over 13 years of age. If this is not the case, you need to contact us immediately to delete any personally identifiable information from our records.

Depending on your relationship with Enhancv, we’d collect different types of information, as outlined below.

##### Usage information

What is it?

When visiting one of our domains, we will collect information about your interaction with the site, like pages you visit and specific actions you take like signing up or sharing one of our [resume examples.](https://enhancv.com/resume-examples/)

When using the Enhancv platform for creating your resume, we will collect information about the way our platform is used, including features used, resume sections used, number of resumes created, design elements used, etc. All information you knowingly include in your resume, including email, address, telephone number, is also stored in our database.

This information is collected in combination with data like user location, Internet browser type, device, operating system, your language preference, or the referring website you came to us through.

If, during the usage of Enhancv, you decide to take advantage of our Invite Friends feature and decide to invite friends by email, we will collect and store the email addresses of those friends in order to show you whether they have subscribed through your link or not, to provide you with the option of resending the invitation and to remind you which of your friends you’ve already invited. In all other cases when using the feature (e.g. sharing the link on social media or as a link in direct messaging platforms), we will only collect referral data, showing us a person came through your invite link, so that we can assign your earned credit.

How do we use it?

Usage information is used primarily in aggregate for statistical purposes. It helps us understand which parts of our product are of greatest interest and also provides information used to improve our platform and develop exciting new features. This information is shared with our third-party analytics services (including [Google Analytics](http://analytics.google.com/), [Amplitude](http://amplitude.com/), [Intercom](http://intercom.com/) and [Attribution App](http://attributionapp.com/)). Those services operate either within the EU or in accordance with the [EU-US Privacy Shield](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/eu-us-privacy-shield_en), ensuring the secure transfer of information.

Resume content is stored for the purpose of providing you with the primary service of Enhancv - creating, storing, displaying, and rendering your resume. This information is stored in JSON format in [mLab](https://mlab.com/company/legal/privacy/) database hosting.

Information about your invited friends is sent to [Mandrill](http://mandrillapp.com/) for the purpose of sending out the email invitations.

Data retention

Usage information stored in [Google Analytics](http://analytics.google.com/) is kept up to 26 months after your last visit and afterwards used only in aggregate reports. Usage information in Amplitude, Intercom, and Attribution App is kept for an indefinite period of time and used only in aggregate to analyze usage patterns.

Resume content is stored for the duration of that resume being kept on our platform. If you delete your resume or delete your account, all resume content is instantaneously removed from our database.

Information about invited friends is kept within the [Mandrill](http://mandrillapp.com/) platform for 30 days after email sendout.

##### Log information

What is it?

Log data contain data about the nature of each access of our services, including originating Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and endpoint (the requested files on our platform), as well as timestamps for this activity. Web servers usually keep log files that record data each time a device accesses those servers.

We will also collect error logs which may collect more system data needed to fix known platform bugs.

How do we use it?

Log data is used to analyze platform usage, improve performance and eliminate any bugs. We primarily look at this information in aggregate, but we might review individual logs when looking for the cause of a specific issues. This may happen either by our own initiative or in relation to a request you log with our customer success team.

Only a small part of our engineering team has access to the full platform logs.

Data retention

Log data stored on our platform is kept for an indefinite period of time to help us review potential recurrence of bugs and user issues, and to monitor any attempts for unauthorised access to our services.

##### Account information

What is it?

When you create an account on the Enhancv platform, you may register with your name, email address and a password you choose. Those are stored in our platform.

If you choose to register by using a third-party account ([LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/) or [Facebook](http://facebook.com/)), we receive your personal information (name, profile photo, email, and work experience information that can be included in your resume) from third parties if you give permission to those third parties to share your information with us. Your password for those third-party services is never shared with us.

How do we use it?

##### Billing information and Payment details

What is it?

Payments are processed by [Braintree](https://www.braintreepayments.com/), a Level 1 PCI DSS compliant third-party and your credit card info is safely stored with them. Our partners never share with us payment details - we never receive your credit card or Paypal account information under any circumstances.

We analyze and review payment trends with the help of [Baremetrics](https://baremetrics.com/). Information contains name, user email addresses, information about plan types and sums paid.

How do we use it?

We use your billing information to log payments submitted as part of your plan. You can view information about all payments you’ve made to us on the [Billing page](https://app.enhancv.com/billing) of your account. You are also able to update your details whenever you need to.

Aggregate information about payments is used with statistical purposes and to execute our legitimate interest of making our business more sustainable.

Data retention

We store billing information and a full history of your payments even if you cancel your subscription or delete your account. This is part of our legal obligation to keep transaction records for local or international authorities. We also store your IP address together with your invoice data, so that we pay tax accordingly and comply with European Tax Law.

We never receive or store any payment details - they are kept with our payment partners. For further information you may refer to [Braintree’s privacy policy](http://www.braintreepayments.com/en-gb/legal/braintree-privacy-policy).

You can unsubscribe from both types of communication - you will find an unsubscribe link in the footer of each promotional email we send out. You can also manage those settings from your [Enhancv Account](https://app.enhancv.com/profile). All our email communication is managed through our partners [Intercom](http://intercom.com/).

If you are a registered user of our platform, we will continue sending high priority information about your account, billing status, changes to our terms of service and other important topics.

Contact information used for subscribing to promotional emails or product news is kept in our active subscriber lists. If you unsubscribe, we will still keep your contact information on file to prevent future email send-outs.

For all types of communication information, you can request that we delete your data and we’ll do so within a 30 day period.
