We have designed engineering.com's web pages in such a way that you can visit most public areas without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself.

## Tracking your subscriber information

This profile data allows us to better match our content to the needs of our audience. For example, if your engineering specialty is “mechanical” you will be more likely to be presented with content that is specifically aimed at mechanical engineers. Engineering.com is a free service that is supported by advertising, so we also use this data to better match advertisements and promotions to our audience.

You may choose whether or not to provide Personal Information to engineering.com. If you choose not to provide the Personal Information we request, you can still visit most of engineering.com's Web pages, but you may be unable to access certain pages and the services that they contain.

Third parties provide certain services, such as email list maintenance, available on engineering.com or on our behalf.
