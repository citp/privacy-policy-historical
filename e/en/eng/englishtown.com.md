**On what do we base our right to collect and use Personal Data?**

We base our right to collect and use your Personal Data on the need to do so in order to provide you with the services or products that you have ordered from us, or when there is a legitimate interest for us (i.e. the service provider) to use your personal data, such as for the marketing of products or services similar to the one(s) you have already purchased from that same legal entity.  
 

**Please note that we ask you not to disclose any sensitive personal information on or through the site or otherwise to us.**

To the extent that we use your Personal Data to send you offers beyond what is considered to be within our legitimate interest, such as marketing of products and services provided by an EF affiliate, we base this on your specific consent.

SECURITY

We use appropriate organizational, technical and administrative measures to keep the Personal Data under our control accurate and up-to-date, as well as to protect the Personal Data against unauthorised or unlawful processing and the accidental loss, destruction or damage of the Personal Data.

COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SITE

To send you an Email English lesson every day, we would, of course, need to know your email address. As an Email English subscriber, you will be added to our mailing list to receive occasional emails about service updates, special offers, and promotions from EF English Live and other companies within the EF group of companies.

You have the ability to unsubscribe from these emails at anytime, by simply clicking on the unsubscribe link included at the bottom of each email we send. 

We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. 

Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.

UNSUBSCRIBE

If at any time you wish to stop receiving marketing communications from us you can use the unsubscribe feature in the marketing communication you received or let us know by using the contact information listed in the “Contact Us” section or by changing your privacy settings in the EF English Live online school. In your request, please indicate that you wish to stop receiving marketing communications from us.

Please note that changes may not be effective immediately. We will endeavour to comply with your request(s) as soon as reasonably practicable.

THIRD PARTY SITES

This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information or other practices of any third parties, including any third party operating any site to which the EF Product contain a link. The inclusion of a link on EF Products does not imply endorsement of the linked site by us or by our affiliates.

Please note that any information that you provide through the use of this functionality is governed by the applicable third party’s privacy policy, and not by this Privacy Policy. We have no control over, and shall not be responsible for, any third party’s use of information that you provide through use of this functionality.

HOW LONG DO WE STORE PERSONAL DATA?

We will only keep your Personal Data for five (5) years after the expiry of your account, in order to be able to provide you the possibility to re-activate your account, should you decide to purchase additional courses from us; or otherwise for as long as it is necessary for the purposes for which it has been collected or in accordance with time limits stipulated by law and market practice, unless further retention is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or unless a specific time period has been communicated.

We will keep limited parts of your Personal Data which are necessary for marketing purposes until you withdraw your consent, but in no event for longer than 5 years after your last completed service or delivery of product.

IF YOU ARE UNDER THE AGE OF 16

If you are under the age of 16, you should review this text together with your parent or guardian to make sure you both understand them.

If we learn that you are under the age of 16 and that we have collected information about you without consent from your parent or guardian, we will delete the information as soon as possible and you will not be able to use EF Products.

SENSITIVE DATA

We do not generally seek to collect any sensitive Personal Data. Sensitive Personal Data is data related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, health or medical condition, criminal background or trade union membership. In certain situations, this might however be necessary (for example in order to provide you with the services and products you have ordered). We will make sure that we receive your explicit consent to such processing and treat this information securely.

UPDATES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not significantly reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without informing you. We will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and, prior to implementing such changes, we will provide a more prominent notice. Where required by law, we will seek your prior consent to any change.
