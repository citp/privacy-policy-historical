**Privacy Policy**

Protecting your privacy is important to ENGENIUS TECHNOLOGIES, INC. We strive to keep your personal information confidential. By ensuring that you are aware of and understand the ENGENIUS TECHNOLOGIES, INC. Customer Privacy Policy, we can provide you with better service. Please take a moment to read the following policy to learn how we handle your personal information. 

**Why we collect personal information**

ENGENIUS TECHNOLOGIES, INC. collects and uses your personal information to give you superior customer service, to provide you with convenient access to our products and services, and to make a wider range available to you. In addition, we use your personal information to keep you up to date on the latest product announcements, software updates, special offers, and other information we think you'd like to hear about. This may occasionally include information from other technology companies about products and services that can add value to your ENGENIUS TECHNOLOGIES, INC. products. From time to time, we may also use your personal information to contact you to participate in a market research survey, so that we can gauge customer satisfaction and develop better products. 

**How we collect personal information**

We collect information about you in several ways. For example, we might ask for your contact information when you correspond with us, call us to make a purchase or request service, register to attend a seminar, or participate in an online survey. In addition, when you register a new ENGENIUS TECHNOLOGIES, INC. product, sign up for  an ENGENIUS TECHNOLOGIES, INC. webinar or live seminar, or ask to be included in an email mailing list, we collect and store the information you provide in a secure database. 

To save you time and make our web services even easier to use, some areas of the ENGENIUS TECHNOLOGIES, INC. website allow you to create an "ENGENIUS TECHNOLOGIES, INC. ID" using your personal information. Here's how it works: Simply fill out a brief profile-your name, phone number, and email address-then choose a password and password hint (such as the month and day of your birth) for security. The system saves your information and assigns you a personal ENGENIUS TECHNOLOGIES, INC. ID. Next time you utilize any of our web services your information will be recalled for you. 

  
 **When we disclose personal information**

Because ENGENIUS TECHNOLOGIES, INC. is a global company, your personal information may be shared with other ENGENIUS TECHNOLOGIES, INC. business units around the world. They will protect your personal information in accordance with the ENGENIUS TECHNOLOGIES, INC. Customer Privacy Policy. ENGENIUS TECHNOLOGIES, INC. may occasionally share your personal contact information with carefully selected technology companies, to keep you informed about related products and services. For example, when new software or hardware is released, we may work with other developers to ensure that you're aware of the latest software or hardware available. If you do not want to receive promotional information from ENGENIUS TECHNOLOGIES, INC. or these technology companies, click [nopromo@engeniustech.com](mailto:nopromo@engeniustech.com) and send us a message stating that you would like to not be included in such updates. 

ENGENIUS TECHNOLOGIES, INC. works with other companies that help us provide ENGENIUS TECHNOLOGIES, INC. products and services to you, and we may provide your personal information to these companies. For example, we give shipping companies this information so they can deliver your products efficiently. The information they receive is for shipping and delivery purposes only, and we require that the companies safeguard your personal information in accordance with ENGENIUS TECHNOLOGIES, INC.'s policies. 

At times we may be required by law or legal process to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we believe that disclosure is necessary for the public interest. 

**How we protect your personal information**
