Registration is not required to use this site, with the exception of the Chat Room section, where users must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give contact information including a username, password, and valid email address. We do not use this information for other purposes other than informing users about new content.

**Cookies**  
We do not use cookies on the users' computer as we believe this will only create unnecessary anxiety on the part of the users who simply want to get some information for their English study. 

**Log Files**  
Like most standard Website servers, we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movements in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.

If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and email address. Out of respect for our users privacy we provide a way to opt-out of these communications.

  
**Service Announcements**  
On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature.

**Customer Service**  
We do not communicate with users on a regular basis except that they require a service such as a translation that we may, under no obligations, provide to our users.
