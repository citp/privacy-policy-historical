When a person becomes a member of Engineers Australia, certain personal information must be collected in order to verifty the person’s identity for membership status, verify engineering credentials and ascertain their appropriate membership category, status and interest group.  The personal information of members is stored electronically and accessible by members with a secure login on a database called myPortal.

In accordance with By-Law 18.1 and Regulation 8.15 of the Engineers Australia _General Regulations 2013_ , Engineers Australia may provide certain personal information about members to any person who might enquire.  The personal information which may be provided about members without seeking any additional consent from that member includes the following:

#### Social Media

Engineers Australia holds a number of social media accounts on platforms which include Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter.

Engineers Australia is bound by the privacy policies of the various social media platforms and does not use those platforms to gather personal information for use in other forms.  Where the content on any of our social media accounts is deemed to be in breach of our Privacy Policy, we will take prompt action to address the situation with the person directly or by removing the offending material.

#### Direct Marketing

Engineers Australia will use personal information for the purposes of direct marketing where we have obtained express consent to do so.  We are not permitted to send Direct Marketing communications unless we have your consent and we are required to comply with specific privacy legislation including the  _Spam Act 2003_  (Cth) and the  _Do Not Call Register Act 2006_  (Cth).

Where consent has been provided to use personal information, that consent will remain current until we are advised otherwise.  _Opting out_ of these communications can be facilitated by updating communications preferences in myPortal, or by informing Engineers Australia by email or telephone.

For the purposes of direct marketing we use Remarketing with Google Analytics to advertise online.  This means that we collect and store data about traffic on our website to gain information on, for example, the most visited web pages or the most common searches done by members.  This information is then used to determine what information, services and benefits are likely to be of most interest to members in direct marketing.  This information is not considered personal information because there are no unique identifiers collected, stored or used in the process.

#### Disclosure of personal information to third parties

Members of Engineers Australia are entitled to receive a copy of the member magazine – C _reate_.  Members opt-in to receiving the magazine by becoming members of Engineers and, by so doing, give authority for Engineers Australia to provide their name and address to the magazine publisher _Mahlab Media_ for the purpose of distributing the magazine. _Opting out_ of these communications can be facilitated by informing Engineers Australia by email or telephone that they no longer wish to receive this publication.

Engineers Australia shares information with our wholly owned subsidiary, Engineering Education Australia Pty Ltd for the purposes of providing integrated products and services, and an improved user experience. Where consent has been given, Engineers Australia may also include the disclosure of names and addresses for the purpose of communicating by mail and electronically on training and education course information of relevance to the recipient.  Members can, at any time, opt out of receiving any additional material.

We disclose high level statistical information to companies that participate in Engineers Australia Member Benefits Programs.  These partnership companies offer special rates or benefits on commercial services such as credit cards, car hire and insurance.  The suppliers are reviewed regularly, and a full listing is contained in the member services section of the Engineers Australia website.

With the consent of members, we disclose name and address details to providers of goods and services deemed by Engineers Australia to be of benefit to members. These offerings include products, services, conferences of a technical nature or in a geographical grouping targeting engineering purchasers and practitioners. 

Engineers Australia may disclose personal information to third party conference organisers for specific functions and activities. Engineers Australia may also provide names and addresses to a third party to print renewal invoices, membership cards, arrears notices, and conference information.  In these situations, we prohibit the third parties from using personal information about members except for the specific purpose for which we supply it to be used on our behalf.

Engineers Australia makes certain registers and lists publicly available. This includes the National Engineering Register (NER) and names of office bearers, Board, National Congress, various committees and panels.  The disclosure is usually limited to names and post-nominals but may, where appropriate and with consent, include contact details. 

#### Accuracy of personal information

Engineers Australia undertakes to do all things necessary to ensure that stored personal information is accurate, complete and up to date.  We regularly audit our data and request members to update records whenever possible.

#### Security of personal information

Engineers Australia has measures in place to protect personal information from misuse and loss.  The steps we take to ensure protection include the use of firewalls, encryption, anti-virus software and login and password protection.  In addition, access is restricted to authorised personnel and training is provided to staff on the Privacy Act. 

Engineers Australia will keep personal information for as long as it is needed to provide members with products and services.  We will take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify personal information no longer needed.

#### Complaints

If there is a complaint about the way Engineers Australia has collected, stored or used personal information, a complaint should be made to the Privacy Officer of Engineers Australia in the Office of the CEO in Canberra.

Our Privacy Officer will endeavour to deal with the complaint and take any steps to resolve the complaint within two weeks of receiving the complaint.  If the complaint cannot be resolved within that period we will write to the complainant setting out the status of the complaint, any further steps needed to be taken and an estimated length of time required to resolve the complaint.  We will inform the complainant whether it is considered that any breach of the Privacy Act has occurred and, if so, the steps being taken to rectify the situation.
