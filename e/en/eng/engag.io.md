This Privacy Policy was last updated on April 26th, 2016.

**Our Policy:**

Engagio, Inc. (“Engagio” or “we”) provides its account-based marketing services (“Services”) to its business customers (its “Business Partners”) through a SaaS offering, and provides information relating to those Services through its website at www.engagio.com and related pages and subdomains (the “Site”). This privacy policy describes Engagio’s collection, use, and disclosure of the information we collects from visitors to the Site, including personally identifiable data (“Personal Data”), as well as Engagio’s practices relating to information we may receive from our Business Partners in connection with our Services.

**Information We Collect through the Site**

When you visit and interact with us through the Site, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below:

**Personal Data That You Provide Through the Site:** We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our surveys, or register for access to the Services. Wherever Engagio collects Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy.

**By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data to Engagio via the Site, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Engagio and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States.**

**Other Information:**

**Non-Identifiable Data:** When you interact with Engagio through the Site, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. Engagio may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Engagio affiliates, agents or service providers. We may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, and the domain names of our visitors’ Internet service providers. It is important to note that no Personal Data is available or used in this process.

We may use a technology called “cookies” in operating and managing the Site. A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts the Site gives to your browser when you access the Site. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze usage of the Site accurately. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off.

**Aggregated Personal Data:** In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the visitors to the Site, Engagio may conduct research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and Engagio may share this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. Engagio may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.

**Google Analytics and Similar Technologies:** We may allow third party service providers to use cookies or similar technologies to collect information about your browsing activities over time and across different websites following your visit to the Site. For example, we may use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies to help us analyze how users use the Site and enhance your experience when you use the Service. For more information on how Google uses this data, go to [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/).

**Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information:  
**Engagio uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services. Engagio and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the “Related Companies”) may also use your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through the Site to help us improve the content and functionality of the Site, to better understand our users and to improve the Site and Services. Engagio and its affiliates may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. We strive to ensure that each marketing communication we send you contains instructions permitting you to “opt-out” of receiving future marketing communications. In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future marketing communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below.

If Engagio intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with the Privacy Policy then in effect, Engagio will (i) inform you of such use by email or by a notice on the Site prior to such use, or (ii) specify the intended use of any Personal Data at the time that the Personal Data is collected.

**Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information:  
**Engagio is not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:

**Business Transfers:** As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.

**Related Companies:** We may also share your Personal Data with our Related Companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.

**Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties:** Engagio, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing payments. When we employ another entity to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.

**Legal Requirements:** Engagio may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Engagio, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Site, Services or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.

**Your Choices:**  
You can visit the Site without providing any Personal Data. If you choose not to provide any Personal Data, you may not be able to register for or use the Services.

**Business Partner Data:  
**In connection with the Services Engagio provides to our Business Partners as described above, our Business Partners may electronically submit to us data or information relating to their business, including Personal Data received by our Business Partners from their respective users, customers, and business partners (collectively “Business Partner Data”). Engagio uses Business Partner Data according to the terms of our relevant agreement with Partners, or as may be required by law. Note that the collection, use, and disclosure of any information by our Business Partners are governed by the privacy policies of our Business Partners, and are not covered by this Privacy Policy.

**Exclusions:**

This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Data collected by Engagio other than Personal Data collected through the Site. This Privacy Policy shall not apply to any unsolicited information you provide to Engagio through any other means. This includes, but is not limited to, information shared with Engagio or its representatives in person or in phone or email correspondence, ideas for new products or modifications to existing products, and other unsolicited submissions (collectively, “Unsolicited Information”). All Unsolicited Information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and Engagio shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, and distribute such Unsolicited Information to others without limitation or attribution.

**Children:**  
Engagio does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Data through the Site. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Data on the Site without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Data to Engagio through the Site, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.

**Links to Other Web Sites:**  
This Privacy Policy applies only to the Site. The Site may contain links to other web sites not operated or controlled by Engagio, including the sites operated by our Business Partners (the “Third Party Sites”). The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to the Third Party Sites. The links from the Services do not imply that Engagio endorses or has reviewed the Third Party Sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies.

**Security:  
**Engagio takes reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data provided via the Site from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, email sent to or from the Site may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Data to Engagio via the Internet.

**Changes to Engagio’s Privacy Policy:**  
Our business may change from time to time. As a result, at times it may be necessary for Engagio to make changes to this Privacy Policy. Engagio reserves the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time without prior notice. Please review this policy periodically, and especially before you provide any Personal Data through the Site. This Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated above. Your continued use or access to the Site and the Services after any changes or revisions to this Privacy Policy shall indicate your agreement with the terms of such revised Privacy Policy.
