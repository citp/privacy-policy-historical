**How We Protect Your Data**  
The security and reliability of our service is our number one priority. We invest heavily in the training of our staff and our infrastructure to ensure that best practices are followed in everything that we do.

In addition, we have an extensive internal review and Quality Assurance process in place specifically to prevent potential security vulnerabilities in our plugins and services.

Every Engineers Edge employee and contractor goes through background checks and an onboarding process that includes a trial period where access to customer data is provided only when working directly under the supervision of another staff member.

All staff only have access to systems that are directly required to complete the functions of their job. We use dual and triple factor authentication for all critical systems and communications services, and automatically log all staff activity using an internal logging tool.

We only use third-party services, that are fully vetted and adhere to the highest levels of privacy and security practices.

 **What Data Breach Procedures We Have In Place**  
Should any event occur where customer data has been lost, stolen, or potentially compromised, our policy is to alert our customers via email no later than 48 hours of our team becoming aware of the event. We will also report such incident to any required data protection authority. We will work closely with any customers affected to determine next steps such as any end-user notifications, needed patches, and how to avoid any similar event in the future.
