INFORMATION ENGAGE:BDR, LLC COLLECTS

_Personal Identifiable Information (PII)_

Personal Identifiable Information is data that can be used directly, or with reasonable effort, indirectly, to contact or identify you, and may include, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, date of birth, age, gender, email address and home address, among other things.

engage:BDR, LLC does not intentionally collect PII from website visitors and takes precautions to avoid the collection of PII. engage:BDR, LLC cannot guarantee it may not inadvertently come into the possession of PII. Additionally, engage:BDR, LLC may obtain PII from our website when you, the website user, choose to provide it to engage:BDR, LLC. Collection of PII may occur when you send us PII about yourself in an email or by completing an online form or registration on our website. PII obtained in this manner may be stored for a reasonable time for record keeping purposes. You are not required to provide any PII to us unless you choose to access features on this site which require the information. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy or other terms of use on this website, then you should immediately exit this website and discontinue using the site.

_Non-Personal Identifiable Information (Non-PII)_

Non-Personal Identifiable Information is information that cannot be used to personally identify the user. As part of our on-going efforts to ensure the best possible experience for all advertising recipients, our technology may use log files, web beacons and cookies to collect data from browsers, advertisers and third party sites to aggregate information. The information collected is used for marketing purposes, enabling us to determine which advertisements perform well, allowing us to more effectively match advertisements and website content to your interests, assisting us in improving the operation of our services, and enabling us to provide general statistics to our business partners and clients regarding use of engage:BDR, LLC’s services.

HOW INFORMATION IS COLLECTED

“Log files” track actions occurring on websites and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, click data and types of advertisements viewed.

“Web beacons” consist of small strings of code that represent a graphic image request on a web page, a page in an online application, or in an email. A graphic image can be associated with the web beacon, but it is not required. When an image is present, usually the image is designed to blend into the background of the web page, application, or email in which it appears. Often a beacon will be placed by an online data collecting company without an image, so it is invisible to the user, and in the smallest discrete space possible on the screen. This is a “pixel” and is essentially an invisible web beacon. Pixels and web beacons can be used for site traffic reporting, unique visitor counts, advertising auditing and reporting, personalization, and other uses. This is  typically done by writing or editing cookies on each user’s computer. Therefore, like cookies, they cannot be used to log keystrokes, copy personal files from your computer, or replicate like a virus.

“Cookies” are files (e.g. HTTP cookies) that are stored on your internet enabled device (which includes your computer, cellular phone or other PDA). Nearly all websites, including ours, use a feature of your internet browser to set a Cookie on your device. The website which places a cookie on your device can then recognize the device when you revisit the site. Cookies are used to improve the experience users have when they see web advertisements and ensure that when a web user clicks on an advertisement, they are sent to the correct click-through destination. We may use Cookies to estimate the total reach of an advertising campaign, as well as frequency of display. This allows advertisers to determine with greater accuracy the composition of the audience they reach. Cookies are also used to control the delivery of a series of advertisements to a web browser, and to limit the number of times a web browser receives any one advertisement. You can turn off all cookies, in case you prefer not to receive them. You can also have your computer warn you whenever cookies are being used. For both options you have to adjust your browser settings (such as Mozilla, Firefox, or Internet Explorer). There are also software products available that can manage cookies for you. Please be aware, however, that when you choose to reject cookies, this choice may limit the functionality of the website you visit and you may lose access to some of its features.
