# Engine Yard — privacy — Privacy

Engine Yard, Inc. has created this Privacy Statement to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. This statement sets forth our information gathering and dissemination practices for the sites.

## What We Collect and Where

Our sites use several different forms that our customers can use to request information, products, and services. From these forms, we collect the following information:

  * Visitors’ contact information (like e-mail addresses)
  * Unique identifiers (like customer numbers)
  * Financial information (like account or credit card numbers)
  * IP addresses



## How Secure is the Information We Collect?

Engine Yard makes every effort to follow industry standard security measures to prevent the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. All financial information is encrypted during transmission, and our company databases are accessible only to internal employees.

## What Do We Use This Information For?

### Contact Information

We use your contact information to send you information about our company and to get in touch with you when necessary. We also use the information we collect to improve the content of our Web site. Our site allows you to opt out of receiving communications from us. You will be given this choice at the points where we request your information. If you do not wish to receive future marketing mailings, please send e-mail to info@engineyard.com. For other ways to contact us, please see our web page.

### Financial Information

We may ask you to enter your credit card or account information in Engine Yard to enable us to debit your account when you purchase services from us. All information you will be asked to enter is protected using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption to prevent it from being intercepted by anyone else as it is transferred over the Internet. We collect this information on a transaction-by-transaction basis and will never authorize the release of this information to anyone not directly involved in processing the transaction. This information may be encrypted and stored for logging purposes.

### IP addresses

We use your unique network address (IP address) to help diagnose problems with our servers, and to administer our Web site.

### Cookies

We may use cookies to keep track of your actions and purchases on www.engineyard.com. We also use them to recognize return visitors and to track our promotions. We gather this information for internal use only and will never authorize the release of this information to anyone outside Engine Yard.

### Linked Sites

This site contains links to external websites. Engine Yard is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these websites.

## Disclosure Of Customer Information And Communications

Engine Yard will not otherwise disclose its customers’ personal and account information unless Engine Yard has reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, make contact with, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing harm or interfering with the rights or property of Engine Yard, Engine Yard’s customers, or others, or where Engine Yard has a good faith belief that the law requires such disclosure.

Engine Yard also will not, except for reasons stated below, disclose to third parties the contents of any electronic mail or other electronic communications that Engine Yard stores or transmits for its customers. The circumstances under which Engine Yard will disclose such electronic customer communications are when:

  1. It is necessary in order to provide service to the customer;
  2. It is necessary to protect the legitimate interests of engine yard and its customers;
  3. It is required to cooperate with interception orders, warrants, or other legal process that engine yard determines in its sole discretion to be valid and enforceable; and
  4. It is necessary to provide to a law enforcement agency when the contents are inadvertently obtained by engine yard and appear to pertain to the commission of a crime.



Engine Yard disclaims any intention to censor, edit or engage in ongoing review or surveillance of communications stored on or transmitted through its facilities by customers or others. Engine Yard will, however, review, delete or block access to communications that may harm Engine Yard, its customers or third parties. The grounds on which Engine Yard may take such action include, but are not limited to, actual or potential violations of Engine Yard’s Acceptable Use Policy.

We do not share your data with others except as necessary to process payments, provide services, or in response to court-issued subpoenas or search warrants. In order to protect our legal interests, in the event of a subpoena or search warrant, Engine Yard may voluntarily provide to all legal authorities any and all information requested, with or without contacting you.

Customer information may be available as a consequence of the specific services ordered. For example, domain name registration requires that customer information be made available through a central registry as well as a public WHOIS server. Contracting for other services may require that customer data be shared with a service provider in order to provide the service.
