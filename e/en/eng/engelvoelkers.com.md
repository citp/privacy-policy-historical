Facebook  
  
The Engel & Völkers website uses social plugins ("plugins") of the social network facebook.com, operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA ("Facebook"). These plugins are marked with a Facebook logo. If the customer accesses an Engel & Völkers website that contains such a plugin, the customer's browser will establish a direct connection to the Facebook servers. Facebook transmits the contents of the plugin directly to the customer's browser where it is integrated into the website.

The plugin integration provides Facebook with the information that the customer has accessed the corresponding page of the Engel & Völkers website. If the customer is logged into Facebook, Facebook can assign the customer's visit to the customer's Facebook account. If the customer interacts with the plugins, for example by using the "Like" button or leaving a comment, the browser transmits the corresponding information directly to Facebook where it is saved. The purpose and scope of the data collection and the further processing and use of the data by Facebook as well as related rights and settings available to customers to protect their privacy can be found in the Facebook privacy policies. 

If the customer does not want Facebook to collect data in the aforementioned way, the customer must log out of his/her Facebook account before visiting the Engel & Völkers website.
