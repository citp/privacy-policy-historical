## **What Cookies and Web Beacons Are and How We and Others Use Them**

The Website may use various software technologies including “cookies,” “web beacons” and “pixel tags.” “Cookies” are small text files that we and others may place in visitors' computer browsers to store their preferences. Cookies themselves do not contain any personal data. "Web beacons" or “Pixel tags” are small pieces of code placed on a web page or within the body of an email to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a web page or viewing or opening an email. For example, web beacons can be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that page. We may use web beacons on the Website from time to time for this and advertising purposes.

We use cookies to deliver personalized content, to save you having to re-enter your password repeatedly, to keep track of your shopping cart, and to tailor our information offerings relating to how you and others use the Website. From time to time, we partner with third parties who may place cookies on your browser when you visit the Website, may send their own cookies to your cookie file, and may use those cookies to track and collect information about you and your online activities over time and across different websites, devices, and applications and to provide targeted advertising based on your interests and previous browsing history. Some cookies remain on your mobile phone, computer or mobile device until they are deleted.

Certain third party ad networks may automatically collect information about your visits to the Website and other websites, such as your IP address, your Internet service provider, and the browser you use to visit the Website. They do this using cookies, web beacons or other technologies. You can learn more about the practices of many of these third parties by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance (<https://www.aboutads.info/choices/>) in the USA, Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (<https://youradchoices.ca/>) in Canada or the European Digital Advertising Alliance (<https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/>) in Europe. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, cookies or web beacons and other technologies in third party advertising. We encourage you to check the privacy policies of third party advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of cookies, web beacons and other technology.

Some web browsers (including some mobile web browsers) provide settings that allow you to control or reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer, tablet or mobile device. Although you are not required to accept cookies, if you block or reject them, you may not have access to all the features available through our services. For more information, visit the help page for your web browser.

## **What Internet Protocol Addresses Are**

An Internet protocol (“IP”) address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (“ISP”). EnterpriseDB may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, to prevent our servers from being abused and for other uses described in this Privacy Policy.

The following third parties may collect information through the Website, including personal data:

  * Third parties that help facilitate the Website may, from time to time, collect information through the Website in the course of providing support;
  * Third party advertisers may collect information about your mobile phone, computer or mobile device relating to the way you interact with the Website, or which third party advertisers you visit;

  * The Website may contain links or references to other websites, including third party advertisers and other unaffiliated websites.



## **How We Secure and Store Your Personal Data**

We have put in place reasonable and appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures in an effort to help safeguard information we collect through the Website. However, you should know that no company, including EnterpriseDB, can fully eliminate security risks associated with personal data. To help protect yourself, please use a strong password, do not use the same passwords to access your EnterpriseDB accounts that you use with other accounts or services, and protect your usernames and passwords to help prevent others from accessing your accounts and services.

EnterpriseDB is a global company with affiliates, varied business processes, management structures and technical systems that cross borders. Information collected by EnterpriseDB or on our behalf may be stored on your computers, on your mobile devices, or on our servers, and may be transferred to, accessed from, or stored and processed in, the United States and other countries including but not limited to the Netherlands, England, France, Australia, Japan, South Korea, Pakistan, India, and any other country where EnterpriseDB or its service providers maintain facilities or support centers (a list of EnterpriseDB offices can be found here:[ https://www.enterprisedb.com/locations](https://www.enterprisedb.com/locations)), including jurisdictions that may not have data privacy laws that provide protections equivalent to those provided in your home country. However, we will protect all personal data we obtain in accordance with this Privacy Policy and take reasonable steps to ensure that it is treated lawfully. Personal data we collect may be retained for as long as needed to fulfill legitimate business purposes, including the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, or for a period of time specifically required or allowed by applicable regulations or laws.
