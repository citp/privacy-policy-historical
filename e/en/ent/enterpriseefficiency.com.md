# UBM - UBM LLC Privacy Notice

Effective: January 4th, 2009 

## Scope

UBM LLC (“UBM” or "we")operates through four separate divisions: [Everything Channel](http://everythingchannel.com/)™; [UBM Electronics](http://electronics.ubm.com/)™; [UBM TechWeb](http://www.ubmtechweb.com/)™; and [UBM Studios](http://www.ubmstudios.com/)™.  Each division focuses on the needs of a specific community of technology professionals or other specialized community with shared interests and responsibilities.

This Privacy Notice covers information which you give any of the four divisions about yourself and your professional background as you register for or attend our face-to-face events around the world, as you visit or participate in any of our web sites or online venues hosted on servers in the United States, or subscribe to any of our print publications distributed in the United States, or volunteer information in any social media context. We will post or display a link to this UBM Privacy Notice on all forms and all online pages to which it is applicable.

In addition, a limited number of our brands and websites within the four divisions publish a separate, different privacy policy based on a particular business model and relationship with customers. A link to the applicable policy will appear at the bottom of those web pages.

Each division aims to be at the heart of the commercial or professional communities it serves. Our business includes creating opportunities for you to access other companies’ information and resources. When we work with other companies to build co-branded web sites, virtual events, sponsored webinars, or in any way that allows you to connect directly with that other company, we will include a link to this Notice and to the other company’s Privacy Notice as well. Our Notice will govern our collection and use of information about you. We recommend that you read the partner’s Notice as well to learn how that company will treat the information you provide.

## Information That Identifies You

We rely primarily on the information you provide to us – as you register, contact us, participate in surveys, post to public areas of and interact with our web sites, respond to our email campaigns, and participate in webinars or online events. We may also add data from external sources to the information which you have given us, for example, additional details about the company which you list as an employer. We will add information about how you interact with our offerings – your subscriptions, the events you attend, and the like.

We may work to expand our communities by acquiring names and contact details from other sources that have compiled contact information. This information might be public information or data you provided with necessary permissions. We may also invite you to join our communities via third party social and professional networking sites.

### Automatic Data Collection Technologies

We also use cookies and common data collection technologies, including associated web beacons and clear GIFs associated with cookies, on our web pages, newsletters, and in our email campaigns to collect information both on an aggregate and individual basis. 

Some of our websites use Adobe Flash cookies to provide video content. We do not associate the cookies with any information that identifies you as an individual. Please see the [Adobe Flash Player Help](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html) page for additional information about controlling the settings of the Adobe Flash Player on your computer.

We gather date, time, certain information about a user's browser and system or device configuration and capabilites, navigation history and IP address for all visitors to our web sites. We use this information for our internal security audit log, for trend analysis and system administration and to gather broad information about our audiences and their geographic locations.

As described more fully in [More Information About Cookies](http://legal.us.ubm.com/privacy-notice/#More_info), we allow third party advertisers and advertising networks to serve third party advertising displayed on our sites. Their cookies may allow those advertisers to display ads to you once you have left our web pages. The ad servers we use as well as those used by third party advertisers may also read routine information about your browsers and system configuration to manage ad frequency and serve ads in a format most compatible with your system.

## How We Use Information About You

**We use information about you:**

  * to provide the services, publications, and information you request and to manage your account with us.
  * to deliver or display content that matches your professional goals and responsibilities.
  * to contact you with information about and invitations for products and services – ours and other companies’ - directed to your professional goals and responsibilities.
  * to offer you opportunities to connect directly with your peers and with sellers of technology that may be of interest to you.
  * for any other purpose that we tell you about when you give us the information.



## Your Choices

You have a choice about and control over:

**Connecting directly with other companies** for marketing purposes. In addition to providing you with our own editorial content, we offer you the opportunity to access others’ branded content and expertise. When you choose to take advantage of that content or expertise, you choose to have your name and contact details transferred directly to that other company We will put you in direct contact with another company or companies when you choose to:

  * Register for certain registration-only, or “gated” communities. Access to technical resources provided or sponsored by another company is contingent on your agreement that your contact details may be shared with the other company. We may track your interest in that company’s content or our own content over time and disclose your interest to that company.
  * Register for a specific webcast, online event, web site, newsletter, or other offering which is sponsored or co-sponsored by another company.
  * Register for a virtual event with a number of exhibitors. We may give your name and contact details to all exhibitors and give the exhibitor whose booths and resources you access a record of your visits and interaction with content from that exhibitor.
  * Attend one of our face-to-face events. Exhibitors may be given an attendance list for the event. It is up to you, however, to decide whether to leave your business card or allow your RFID-enabled badge to be read by a particular exhibitor – the badges cannot be read remotely. A sponsor of a special, sponsored conference session will also be given information about you if you choose to attend that company’s session. Your future interaction with online content from an exhibitor or sponsor to whom you provided your contact data to may also be tracked and disclosed to that exhibitor or sponsor.



**Receiving email marketing messages from us.**

  * You may opt out of our email marketing lists by following the directions at the bottom of our promotional emails.  Please note that we have a number of brands and products and allow you to opt out selectively.

  * Please note that you may receive email marketing messages from us about other companies’ offerings as part of a list rental or partner marketing programs - but only if you have given us permission to do so. We do not disclose your contact details to the partners, and we do not sell your data. You have the option of contacting the other company directly if you click on the links within the email. To opt out of our partner marketing programs, you may follow the instructions at the bottom of any email we send you as part of the program.

## Important Information

UBM LLC is a subsidiary of [UBM plc](http://www.ubm.com/).

We collect and process information on servers around the world.

We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect personal information against theft, loss, or misuse. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or storage can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure. As a result, while we strive to protect information about you and your professional interests, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you submit to us. You remain responsible for protecting your user name and passwords and for the security of information in transit to us over the Internet.

This privacy Notice covers how we use information you provide. We cannot control how others may use information you may make public on our sites, for example, on professional networking sites or sites inviting user-generated content, in forums, at virtual events, or user-generated blogs.

Please note that virtual events may mimic face-to-face events by automatically displaying information about you to other participants in the event. We cannot control how other participants use that displayed information, so please take a moment to make sure you understand how a particular virtual event works and what choices you have within the environment.

Our products, services, events and offerings are directed to professionals. If we create a special offering for children under the age of thirteen, we will also create privacy practices and policies appropriate for that age group.
