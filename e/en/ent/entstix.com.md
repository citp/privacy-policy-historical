We use the information you provide us with to sell you the tickets you requested. We may occasionally use some of the same information (such as the type of tickets you requested) to tailor the content of this site to the interests of our users. By making a purchase from this site you are consenting to your financial and/or personal information being passed to any third party organisations necessary to process your transactions with us, such as credit card companies and banks. Except for these specific cases, we will never share financial information with third parties without your specific consent.
