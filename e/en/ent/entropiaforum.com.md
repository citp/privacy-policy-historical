THE INFORMATION ENTROPIAFORUM COLLECTS:

Member-provided Information: You may provide to EntropiaForum what is generally called "personally identifiable" information (such as your name, email address, postal mailing address, home/mobile telephone number, etc.) when you register as a Member and if you participate in certain activities on EntropiaForum. In addition, you may choose to post certain information to your public "profile" on EntropiaForum such as your date of birth, general location, interests, occupation, web site URLs, videos, blogs, IM addresses, and comments. 

"Cookies" Information: When you visit EntropiaForum, we may send one or more cookies - small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer. EntropiaForum uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to EntropiaForum. Persistent cookies can be removed. Please review your web browser "Help" file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. 

"Automatically Collected" Information: When you participate in EntropiaForum and, for example, participate in forums, control panel, profile, news, diaries, gallery or the Arcade, or open one of our HTML emails, we may automatically record certain information from your web browser by using different types of technology, including database logging, "clear gifs" or "web beacons." This "automatically collected" information may include Internet Protocol address ("IP Address"), web browser type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after EntropiaForum, the pages you view on our site, and the dates and times that you visit EntropiaForum.

THE WAY ENTROPIAFORUM USES THIS INFORMATION:

When you choose to create a public profile on EntropiaForum, you may post, at your option, certain personal information that will be publicly displayed to other Members on EntropiaForum. EntropiaForum uses the information that we collect to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide to you all of the features and services found on EntropiaForum. We will use your email address, without further consent, for administrative purposes such as sending you account activation and welcome emails, notifying you of major EntropiaForum updates, for customer service purposes, to address copyright infringement issues, or to contact you regarding any EntropiaForum activities in which you are presently participating.

EntropiaForum uses your email address to send to you activity emails, newsletters, and, from time to time, notices about special activities, features, or items available on EntropiaForum. You may opt-out of receiving such notices by indicating your preferences in the Edit Profile section of EntropiaForum. EntropiaForum uses all of the information that we collect to understand the usage trends and preferences of our Members, to improve the way EntropiaForum works and looks, and to create new features and functionality. 

EntropiaForum uses "automatically collected" information and "cookies" information to: (a) remember your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit EntropiaForum; (b) provide customized third-party advertisements, content, and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of third-party marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in any games, promotions, or contests. 

WHEN ENTROPIAFORUM DISCLOSES INFORMATION:

EntropiaForum does not share your personally identifiable information with other organizations for their marketing or promotional uses without your express consent. EntropiaForum may disclose "automatically collected" and other aggregate non-personally-identifiable information with interested third parties to assist such parties in understanding the usage and demographic patterns for certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or other functionality on EntropiaForum.   
EntropiaForum may disclose Member information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright or Criminal law) or respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant. We may make such disclosures, in some cases, without providing Members notice.   
EntropiaForum also reserves the right to disclose Member information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability; protect EntropiaForum from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; to assist government enforcement agencies; to protect the security or integrity of EntropiaForum; and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of EntropiaForum, our Members, or others.

YOUR CHOICES:

You may, of course, decline to share your personally-identifiable information with EntropiaForum, in which case you will not be able to participate in many EntropiaForum activities. You may update, correct, or delete your member information and email subscription preferences at any time by going to the Edit Profile section of EntropiaForum; provided, however, that upon deletion of your account or profile, please note that some of your personal information, including email address and contact information may remain in EntropiaForum's systems for some limited period of time.

To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you account access or making corrections. HOWEVER, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.

THIRD-PARTY ADVERTISERS, LINKS TO OTHER SITES:

If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access EntropiaForum at any time or in any manner. If EntropiaForum learns that personally-identifiable information of persons less than 13-years-of-age has been collected on EntropiaForum without verifiable parental consent, then EntropiaForum will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.
