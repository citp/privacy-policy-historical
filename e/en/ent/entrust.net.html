                <p>We hope that your visit to our site is both informative and useful. As a world leader in securing digital identities and information, we feel that privacy and security are two cornerstones of doing business over the Internet. As a result, Entrust is dedicated to safeguarding the personal information you give us and to providing our customers with the tools, service and support to develop their own world-class privacy and security solutions.</p>
                
                <p>The goal of this privacy statement is to disclose Entrust's data protection practices in relation to personal information collected at Entrust's Internet web sites located www.Entrust.com and www.Entrust.net. These practices have been implemented only on Entrust Inc.'s web sites (including subsidiaries of Entrust Inc.) at www.Entrust.com and www.Entrust.net. Please note that these web-sites contain links to other sites and Entrust is not responsible for the privacy practices of such sites. In the context of this privacy statement, "personal information" does not include name, title, business address or telephone number of an employee of an organization.</p>
                
                <p>Safeguarding your personal information is good business — it helps foster confidence, goodwill and stronger relationships with you, our customers. If, at any time, you have questions or concerns about our privacy practices, please feel free to <a href="#contact">contact us</a>.</p>
                
                <p>In our business, we use appropriate security safeguards and Entrust's award-winning solutions and adhere to Eight Privacy Principles to make sure that your personal information is protected.</p>
                
                <p class="header"><strong>Principle 1 - Safeguarding Personal information:</strong></p>
                <p>As a world leader in Internet security, Entrust will ensure that your personal information is protected by security safeguards that are appropriate to the sensitivity level of the information.</p>
                
                <p class="header"><strong>Principle 2 - Accountability:</strong></p>
                <p>We have designated certain Entrust employees to be accountable for conformity with this Privacy Statement. Their responsibility includes developing and implementing policies and procedures for the protection of all personal information consistent with this Privacy statement.</p>
                
                <p class="header"><strong>Principle 3 - Consent:</strong></p>
                <p>We will obtain your consent for the collection, use or disclosure of personally identifiable information, except under the following circumstances:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Entrust may release personal information when we believe it is appropriate to comply with law, or protect the rights, property, or safety of Entrust or others;
                    </li>
                    <li>Entrust may share personal information with its subsidiaries who will also comply with this policy with respect to the information that is shared;</li>
                    <li>Entrust may employ other companies or individuals who may have access to personal information needed to perform functions on our behalf, but who will not use this information for other purposes; and</li>
                    <li>in the unlikely event that Entrust, Inc., or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will be one of the transferred assets.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p class="header"><strong>Principle 4 - Limiting Collection:</strong></p>
                <p>The personal information we collect will be limited to what is necessary for the business purposes identified unless you have otherwise consented, or when required by law. We will not collect personal information indiscriminately.</p>
                
                <p>Our Web servers collect and track IP addresses and resolves them to a domain name, but we do not collect personally identifiable information unless we explicitly ask you to provide it. Some pages in our Web sites ask you to provide personal information to order a product or service, or to take advantage of other opportunities (e.g., download a white paper). When this information is requested, you will be asked to complete a form and return it to us. The type of information we ask you to provide will vary according to the product or service that you request. The choice to share this information is always yours, but if you choose to withhold it, you will not be able to access certain resources. In addition, we sometimes collect non-identifiable information from visits to our Web sites to help us provide better customer service. For example, we make it possible for users to define usage preferences ("remember settings") to speed requests such as search queries in future
                visits.</p>
                
                <p>Occasionally, we give our subscribers an option to receive updates and product information. If you would prefer not to receive such notifications, you can opt-out by selecting the appropriate box.</p>
                
                <p class="header"><strong>Principle 5 - Accuracy:</strong></p>
                <p>Each person who submits personal information is required to verify the accuracy of all information provided to us at the time of submission. You may also contact us to change this information at the address indicated below.</p>
                
                <p class="header"><strong>Principle 6 - Openness:</strong></p>
                <p>We will endeavor to inform customers, partners and employees about the policies and practices that apply to the management of their personal information.</p>
                
                <p class="header"><strong>Principle 7 - Individual Access:</strong></p>
                <p>On request and to the extent reasonably possible, we will tell you if we have any personal information about you and how it is used. We will endeavor to correct or amend any personal information if its accuracy and completeness is challenged and found deficient.</p>
                
                <p class="header"><strong>Principle 8 - Handling Subscriber Inquiries and Suggestions:</strong></p>
                <p>If you require any further information or if you have any questions or concerns about our privacy or security policies and procedures, please contact us at:</p>
