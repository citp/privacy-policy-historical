This statement discloses the information practices for the [EnterURL.com](http://www.enterurl.com/) and affiliated websites, including what type of information is gathered and tracked, how the information is used, how to correct or change it and with whom the information is shared. These privacy practices apply only to online transactions, activity and to all email communications. **EnterURL.com will not sell your email address to anyone without your express permission and we control all email delivery to assure your privacy.** When we do share information with our partners and advertisers, it is in aggregate form, and does not identify you personally.

**1\. What Personally Identifiable Information Does EnterURL Collect?**   
In general, you can visit EnterURL.com on the Web without telling us who you are and without revealing any information about yourself. There are times, however, when we, or our Service partners, may need information from you in order to provide the requested Services. EnterURL’s primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with the best and most useful Services. EnterURL collects personally identifiable information when a Customer provides it to us, such as when you subscribe to Services, complete a survey, update your profile on our Web site, use certain Services, respond to our emails, and when you visit the EnterURL Web sites. EnterURL may also receive information about you from other sources and add it to the information you have provided to us. EnterURL has implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures, such as using encryption for transmission of credit card numbers, to help us keep your information secure, accurate, current, and complete. We will respond in a timely manner to your requests to correct inaccuracies in your personal information.

**2\. What Anonymous Information Does EnterURL Collect?**  
We collect anonymous information from visits to our sites to help us provide better customer service. For example, we keep track of the domains from which people visit and we also measure visitor activity on EnterURL.com and affiliated websites, but we do so in ways that keep the information anonymous. 

Also, when we collect personal data from you in connection with a transaction we may extract some information about that transaction in an anonymous format and combine it with other anonymous information. This anonymous information is used and analyzed only at an aggregate level to help us understand trends and patterns. If you do not want your transaction details used in this manner, you can either disable your cookies or opt-out of the Services and discontinue visits to the EnterURL and affiliates Web sites.

We collect the anonymous information we mentioned in the previous paragraphs through the use of various technologies, including "cookies". A cookie is an element of data that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your system.

EnterURL.com also automatically receives and records information from our servers and from your browser including your IP address, the time, and information about the page you requested. In order to determine which features Customers find most useful, we use tracking technologies in a variety of ways, including: keeping count of return visits to our site or our advertisers' or partners' sites and accumulating and reporting anonymous, aggregate, statistical information on Web site and advertisement usage. 

EnterURL.com has certain companies help deliver ads and other online communications.
