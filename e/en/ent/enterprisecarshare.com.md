We may access location based information from your mobile device while searching for an Enterprise location in the area in which you have expressed interest. We do not use this information to specifically locate you for any reason other than to provide you the service. If you do not wish to allow us to use your location information then please do not use the service. If you have allowed us to utilize your location information in the past and wish to revoke the permissions to do so please turn off location services at the device level. Failing to provide requested information will not inhibit your ability to browse the Web site or Mobile site, but it may prevent you from being able to complete certain transactions or receive certain services from us.

  * **INFORMATION COLLECTED AND STORED AUTOMATICALLY**



As part of the standard operation of our Web site and Mobile Application, certain information may be automatically provided to our Web servers by your computer or mobile device. For each visitor to our Web site, our Web server automatically recognizes the visitor’s domain name or IP address (where possible), but not the visitor’s email address. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer when you connect to the Internet. As part of the protocol of the Internet, Web servers can identify your computer by its IP address. In addition, we may collect your browser type, operating system and mobile device identification number when using our Mobile Application. Except as otherwise explained in this policy, we may combine the automated information we collect from you (as described above and as described below, under “Cookies & Pixel Tracking”) with your personal information in order to tailor our website and enhance your online experience by saving your preferences and/or to help identify site features, advertisements and offers that may be of interest to you.

  * **MOBILE ANALYTICS**



We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile Software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile application.

  * **COOKIES & PIXEL TRACKING**



Cookies are short strings of text sent from a Web server to a Web browser when the browser accesses a Web site or Mobile site. Cookies may be “session-only” or “persistent.” Persistent cookies last for more than one visit and are typically used to allow a visitor to our Web site to personalize their experience.

By adjusting the settings in your browser, you can refuse to accept cookies, give yourself the opportunity to accept or reject cookies, or simply receive notice of when cookies are being placed. Refusing cookies may impinge or block altogether your user experience by eliminating personalization or other features.

We may use cookies to analyze the traffic on our Web site or Mobile site (such as total visitors and pages viewed), to personalize features and content, to optimize our search engine marketing, to save you the trouble of retyping your name or other information when you come back to our Web site, and to make improvements to the Web site and Mobile site based on the data we collect. We do not save passwords or other sensitive information in cookies. We may also use pixel tags (also known as “clear gifs,” “Web beacons” or “1-by-1gifs”) on our Web site and in our advertisements. We may work with our Affiliates (companies related to us) and our service providers to help us track, collect and analyze this information. Pixel tags may be used to collect a variety of information about your visit to our Web site, including the pages you view, the features you use, the links you click and other actions you take, all of which may be combined with other information we have collected from you. We use this information to enhance the effectiveness of our Web site, to compile aggregate usage statistics, to determine if errors are being encountered on the Web site and for other internal business purposes. Not all of our sites have these capabilities, but we provide you the following choices as to whether or not you wish to have your data used for these purposes:

  * To opt-out of this feature when using our rental sites, please [click here](http://www.coremetrics.com/company/privacy.php#optout). An opt-out cookie will be set, blocking our analytics service provider from collecting your data.

Cookies may also be placed by third parties during your visit to the Web site. Our subsidiaries, affiliates and business partners may use these cookies in connection with their use of pixel tags for online preference marketing purposes (discussed below) or to assist us with some of the previously described functions. We do not control these cookies.

  * **Online Behavior Advertising and California Do not Track Disclosures**



We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet. These companies employ cookie and pixel tag technology to measure and improve the effectiveness of ads for their clients. These third-party advertising companies may use this information automatically collected about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide targeted ads about goods and services of interest to you, and for online preference marketing purposes. **Our system may not respond to Do Not Track requests or headers from some or all browsers. To learn more about the use of cookies or other technologies to deliver more relevant advertising and your choices about not having this information used by certain service providers, please[click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/).**

Please note that opting out of this practice does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

  * To assist you with reserving and renting.
  * To conduct other transactions that you request.
  * To service your account or membership with us, respond to your questions and contact you when necessary.

We may combine the information that you submit to us with information related to your transactions with us, such as rental location and vehicle type, as well as with information we receive about you from credit reporting agencies and other data providers who assist us in processing requests, maintaining our data and optimizing our services.  This Privacy Policy applies only to data collected on-line.

We attempt to retain information we collect for commercially reasonable periods of time or in accordance with specific policies or as required by law to be used for statistical, marketing, archiving, and other analytical purposes.
