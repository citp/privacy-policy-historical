By using our Web site or Mobile site, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your information, as described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use our Web site or Mobile sites.

  
**WHAT INFORMATION IS COLLECTED**

  * **PERSONAL INFORMATION**



As a general rule, you will not be required to provide personally identifiable information as a condition of browsing our Web sites. We attempt to collect the minimum amount necessary to facilitate transactions with you, to improve our Web sites and your customer experience and to make future visits to our Web sites easier and more personalized for you. The personal information we may collect includes but is not limited to your:

  * name

  * driver's license number and expiration date
  * date of birth
  * credit card numbers

For CarSharing and Vanpool services this may also include emergency contact and driving record information.

  * **INFORMATION COLLECTED BY AUTOMATED MEANS**



As part of the standard operation of our Web site, certain information may be automatically provided to our Web servers by your computer. For each visitor to our Web site, our Web server automatically recognizes the visitor’s domain name or IP address (where possible), but not the visitor’s email address. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer when you connect to the Internet. As part of the protocol of the Internet, Web servers can identify your computer by its IP address. In addition, we may collect your browser type and operating system. Except as otherwise explained in this policy, we may combine the automated information we collect from you (as described above and as described below, under “Cookies & Pixel Tracking”) with your personal information in order to tailor our website and enhance your online experience by saving your preferences and/or to help identify site features, advertisements and offers that may be of interest to you.

  * **COOKIES & PIXEL TRACKING**



Cookies are short strings of text sent from a Web server to a Web browser when the browser accesses a Web site. Cookies may be “session-only” or “persistent.” Persistent cookies last for more than one visit and are typically used to allow a visitor to our Web site to personalize their experience.

By adjusting the settings in your browser, you can refuse to accept cookies, give yourself the opportunity to accept or reject cookies, or simply receive notice of when cookies are being placed. Refusing cookies may impinge or block altogether your user experience by eliminating personalization or other features.

In conjunction with these cookies, we may also use pixel tags (also known as “clear gifs,” “Web beacons” or “1-by-1gifs”) on our Web site, emails and in our advertisements. We may work with our Affiliates (companies related to us) and our service providers to help us track, collect and analyze this information. Pixel tags may be used to collect a variety of information about your visit to our Web site, including the pages you view, the features you use, the links you click and other actions you take. Not all of our sites have these capabilities, but we provide you the following choices as to whether or not you wish to have your data used for these purposes: 

  * To opt-out of this feature when using our rental sites, please [click here](http://www.coremetrics.com/company/privacy.php#optout). An opt-out cookie will be set, blocking our analytics service provider from collecting your data. 


  * To opt-out of this feature for our other business units, please [click here](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).



Cookies may also be placed by third parties during your visit to the Web site. Our subsidiaries, affiliates and business partners may use these cookies in connection with their use of pixel tags for online preference marketing purposes (discussed below) or to assist us with some of the previously described functions. We do not control these cookies.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet. These third-party advertising companies may use this automated information about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide ads about goods and services of interest to you, and for online preference marketing purposes. If you would like more information about this practice, and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [click here](http://preferences.truste.com/preference_enterpriseads.html).  Please note this is set through the use of an opt-out cookie and this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads. 

 **HOW COLLECTED INFORMATION IS USED**

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

  * To assist you with reserving and renting.
  * To conduct other transactions that you request.
  * To service your account or membership with us, respond to your questions and contact you when necessary.
  * To provide you with discounts, coupons, offers and other information and opportunities and services that may be of interest to you.
  * To assist us in providing better products and services (for example, we may contact you by telephone, mail or email to assist us in evaluating the performance of our staff, to assess the quality of product and service received and to help us improve our Web site, facilities and services).
  * To compile statistics and analysis about our customers’ use of our Web site, products and services, which statistics are only used to enable us to provide better customer service, products, features and functionality to you and other customers in the future.
  * To help us to operate, maintain and improve our systems and Web site.
  * To allow you to modify or cancel a reservation.

Information collected for a specified purpose will only be used for that purpose and, after a reasonable period of time, will no longer be actively stored when that purpose has been fulfilled.

To update your marketing preferences please see the  **“CORRECTING OR CHANGING YOUR INFORMATION/CONTACTING ENTERPRISE”**  section below.  We also may disclose this information to third parties: (1) when we have reason to believe that such disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, customers or other users of our Web sites or Mobile sites, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities; (2) to respond to judicial process and provide information to law enforcement agencies or in connection with an investigation on matters related to public safety, as permitted by law, or otherwise as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process; and (3) to our Affiliates, business partners and/or third parties, subject to confidentiality agreements as appropriate, for administrative, technical support or other business purposes as necessary to facilitate our transactions with you, analyze our data, conduct mobile analytics services, or to maintain and improve our services. We may disclose your personal information to third-party service providers including a payment processor to bill you for goods or services, an email provider to send email communications to you on our behalf and the provider of our live chat feature in order to offer you customer service.  For our RideShare and Vanpool services these may also include credit bureau (for drivers), an employer, vanpool driver/coordinator and/or local transit authority; however, we will limit the amount of information necessary for these confirmations. These service providers may be located in a country different from your country of residence, such as the United States or European Union member country. These service providers are contractually required to maintain the confidentiality and security of your information. However, your information may be accessible to U.S. or EU authorities in accordance with applicable laws.

Enterprise or its Affiliates may sell or buy other businesses or entities. In such transactions, personal information may be one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the event that Enterprise or substantially all of its assets are acquired, your personal information may be one of the transferred assets.

We may also share aggregated information about our customers with our advertisers and marketing partners.

Except as explained above, we will not share any of your personal information with any third party, unless we have received your express permission to do so.
