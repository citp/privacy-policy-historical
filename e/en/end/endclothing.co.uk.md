Through our interactions with you we collect various kinds of personal data. Some of this data is provided by you directly, and some is collected automatically based on your interactions with our websites, Apps, and emails.

You may decline to provide your personal data, however this may impact our ability to provide you with products or services.

  * When necessary to process your order (for example, sharing your payment details with our payment gateway, Braintree, in order to process your payment, or providing your address and contact details to our shipping courier to deliver your order).
  * To ensure the security and stability of our websites and Apps (for example, we may share error or logging information with Dynatrace, our third party monitoring service, in order to alert us to any technical problems).
  * To market to you using trusted third party vendors (for example, with your consent we may share your data with Oracle Responsys, our email marketing provider in order to send you our email campaigns).



### How to Access & Control Your Personal Data

The primary method of accessing and controlling the personal data we collected is via your END. account. You can at any time request that we delete this data in its entirety by [contacting us](https://endclothing.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/requests/new).

In addition to this you can always opt out of any of our marketing communications at any time:

  * You can opt out of our email marketing campaigns by clicking the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of any of our email campaigns.
  * You can opt out of our push notifications by adjusting the settings in our native Apps.



We will respect any browser based cookie controls or tracking protection that might be enabled, however we do not currently support the “Do Not Track” feature now present in some web browsers as there is not yet a common understanding of how we should interpret this signal.

If you cannot access or control certain personal data you believe we may have collected, you can always [contact us](https://endclothing.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/requests/new). We will respond to requests to control your personal data within 30 days.
