		<p>This Privacy Policy applies to visitors to and Users of all the services ("<em>Services</em>") rendered by Endomondo, 
		its subsidiaries and affiliates via Endomondo.com ("<em>Site</em>") or the necessary software applications 
		("<em>Software</em>") used in connection with the Services to Users ("<em>User</em>" or "<em>you</em>") 
		of the Services. The Privacy Policy is incorporated into, and is subject to the <a href="/terms">Terms</a>. 
		As such, it may be revised from time to time. At any time, the then-current version of the Terms can be found 
		on the Site at <a href="/terms">www.endomondo.com/terms</a>.</p>

		<p>Endomondo is among other regulation subject to the Danish Act on Processing of Personal Data. The Act adopts the European Union Directive 95/46/EC on the Protection of Individuals with regard to the processing and free movement of personal data. In this Privacy Policy personal data is referred to as personal information. All personal information are managed and controlled by Endomondo ApS, Kanonbaadsvej 12B, 1437 Copenhagen K, Denmark.</p>

		<p>BY USING THE SITE AND SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THE PRIVACY POLICY AND ALL REVISIONS THEREOF. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE – DO NOT USE THE SITE OR SERVICES.</p>

		<h3>WE RESPECT YOUR PRIVACY</h3>
		<p>We respect your privacy and integrity and strive to take the best care when we collect, store, use and protect your personal information according to the Terms and this Privacy Policy.</p>

		<h3>COLLECTING PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
		<p>In order for us to provide you the Services we ask for your personal information when you sign up. Such personal information may include your name, email address, postal code, date of birth, gender, sports interests, height, weight, profile picture, etc. ("<em>personal information</em>" or "<em>User Data</em>"). If you choose to sign up via an external sign up feature made available by Endomondo, some of the listed personal information will be transferred to Endomondo from your designated sign up account. If you subscribe to additional Services subject to charges, Endomondo will also require credit card or PayPal information from you.</p>
		<p>When you use the Services additional personal information may automatically or voluntarily be collected from you. Such personal information may include information on your athletic or recreational activities such as location information (GPS-data) and other exercise and performance information, e.g. time, speed, time spent on your activity, cadence, heart rate etc. Some information is dependent on your devices and may require additional hardware. Further personal information related to you may be collected from <a href="/terms#section5">User Generated Content</a> either generated by you or by other Users.</p>
		<p>We encourage you to at all times keep your personal information updated.</p>
		<p>If you provide us with personal information on a third party, for instance if you invite your friends to join you on the Endomondo community, we will only use such third-party data for the specific purpose (delivering the invitation). We will not contact the third party further unless the third party contacts us.</p>
		
		<h3>SHARING PERSONAL INFORMATION AND USER GENERATED CONTENT</h3>
		<p><em>You consent to sharing to the Endomondo Community</em></p>
