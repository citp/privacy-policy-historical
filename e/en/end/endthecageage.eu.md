Cookies are small text files on your computer, smart phone, tablet or other device. They are made by your web-browser when you visit a website. Every time you go back to that website, your browser will send the cookie file back to the website’s server. Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences and generally improving the user experience.

Cookies help Compassion identify which bits of our website people are using, and help us to improve the user experience. Information supplied in cookies also allows us to measure the effectiveness of online marketing campaigns for Compassion so that we can become more efficient.

A cookie, by itself, can’t be used to identify you; we cannot and do not link it with personal information we hold about you (e.g. your name, address, email address). For more information about how our website uses cookies click [here](https://www.ciwf.org.uk/cookies/ "Cookies policy").

## 5\. How and Why Do We Use Your Personal Data?

We use your data for the following purposes:

  * To respond to any correspondence you enter into with us.
  * To manage and process your donations and/or any other way you support us, to keep a record of our relationship.
  * To keep you updated on the work that we are doing and tell you how your donations are being used.
  * To ensure we act on any requests you make about how we do/don’t contact you.
  * For campaigning and fundraising purposes (see Section 8 for more details).
  * Where you sign a petition or otherwise take action, your details maybe sent on to the campaign target, or an email be sent on your behalf, as indicated when you take action.
  * To help us analyse and understand our audience. This allows us to make improvements to our campaigning and fundraising and our service to supporters.
  * To allow us to verify your identity if we are required to do so, to be able to comply with laws and regulations, to protect our organisation and your personal data from fraudulent activities.
  * For research and analysis, to help us to grow the movement against factory farming by finding new audiences and like-minded persons who have similar interests and characteristics. Where research requires your direct involvement, participation will always be optional.
  * For legacy administration purposes (where you are involved, for example as an Executor, in the administration of an Estate that includes a bequest to Compassion). For more information [click here](https://www.ciwf.org.uk/privacy-information-for-legacy-administration/ "Privacy Information for Legacy Administration").
  * In certain circumstances we may use publicly available information, and on occasion use third party services (for example, wealth screening), to help us identify those who may be able to help us financially. We use this information so that we can contact relevant people in the most appropriate way.
  * To comply with our legal obligations and to share data with law enforcement agencies if required to do so.



## 6\. What are the Legal Bases that We Use to Process Your Personal Data?

**Consent:** We use consent to send you details on fundraising and campaigning by email and text. As is your right, you can withdraw your consent at any time. All our fundraising and campaigning emails include an unsubscribe link.

Where you sign a petition or otherwise take action, we also use consent to send your details on to the campaign target, or to send an email on your behalf, as indicated when you take action.

**Performance of a Contract:** We would need to process your information if you enter into a contract with us – for example, to provide your goods or services when you purchase Christmas cards or raffle tickets.

**Legal Obligation:** We need to retain and use certain records to uphold the law, for tax purposes such as Gift Aid administration, to satisfy legal, regulatory and compliance obligations.

**Legitimate Interest:** We may collect and use data where this is reasonably necessary for our legitimate interests. Such processing will be fair, balanced and will not unduly impact on your rights as an individual. For example, there may be times when it is not practical or appropriate to ask for your consent and where we are confident this will not impact on your rights.

Our legitimate interests include campaigning and fundraising to support our charitable objectives. These objectives are to end factory farming and to pioneer abundant sustainable food that is free from animal cruelty. In support of these legitimate interests we may collect or process personal data in the following ways:

  * For administration and governance activities related to Compassion and its entities;
  * To record and respond to any correspondence you enter into with us;
  * To send you campaigning and fundraising materials by post (you can opt-out of these communications at any time);
  * To contact, by email or phone, some very specific audiences relevant to our work (e.g. employees/representatives of food companies, Trusts & Foundations);
  * To record and act on your campaigning and fundraising communication preferences;
  * To administer donations and other ways you support us, and update you on how your donations are used;
  * To thank you for your donations;
  * For research and analysis to help us understand our audience, improve our campaigning, fundraising and service to supporters, and grow the movement against factory farming;
  * In certain circumstances, to undertake research on individuals before we proactively contact them;
  * To administer Estates and gifts in Wills where Compassion is an Executor or beneficiary;
  * To better our efforts against fraud.



## 7\. When and How Do We Collect Your Data?

We collect your data when you contact us directly, or interact with us via a third party, to:

  * Make an enquiry to us
  * Sign up to receive emails
  * Take part in a campaign
  * Make a donation
  * Make a purchase from us (e.g. raffle tickets or Christmas cards)
  * Enquire about or advise us of a gift left in your Will
  * Engage with us on social media
  * Volunteer for us by fundraising or campaigning
  * Attend an event
  * Connect with us online



In certain circumstances, we will conduct our own research and gather information that is available within the public domain. There is a certain amount of publicly available information from sources such as social media, published articles and news channels. We would use this information to improve our communications and fundraising approaches.

When you are engaging with Compassion through a third party, please also check their Privacy Policy.

## 8\. Marketing (Campaigning and Fundraising)

As a charity we communicate with individuals to encourage participation in our campaigns and to raise money to fund our work. We send campaigning and fundraising communications in a variety of ways:

BY EMAIL, SMS & PHONE: We will only communicate for campaigning and fundraising purposes via these channels if you have given us your consent for us to do so. As is your right you can withdraw your consent for any method of communication at any time. All our campaigning and fundraising emails include an unsubscribe link, and you can also contact us via the details in section 14.

BY POST: We send campaigning and fundraising information in the post on the basis of our legitimate interests. You will not receive mail from us if you have specifically requested not to. If you would prefer NOT to receive communications from us in the post, you can let us know via the form included with any of our letters, or by contacting us directly (see section 14). Please note your preferences may not be updated immediately, but we will aim to process your request within 28 days.

BY SOCIAL MEDIAL ADVERTSING: If you are a social media user, we may use tools provided by the leading social media platforms, such as Facebook, to reach individuals likely to engage with and respond to our campaigns. If you have participated in our campaigns and haven’t opted out, we may contact you via social media advertising. We may also use your profile anonymously, and in conjunction with many other profiles, to identify audiences that are also likely to engage with our campaigns and thereby help us achieve our charitable mission and objectives.

In order to improve the performance of our campaigns, we use conversion tracking to measure the outcome and improve the return on investment of Facebook Ads, for example, by reporting on the actions that audiences take after viewing those ads. We add a tracking pixel or cookie to our website and then track these conversions back to ads we are running on Facebook. No personal information is contained in or collected as a result of using pixels. To opt out of remarketing pixels and technologies, visit [Facebook’s ad preferences page here](https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=ad_settings_screen "Facebook ad preferences").

## 9\. How Long Do we Keep Your Data?

Your data is retained for as long as is necessary for the purpose that it was collected for. We are obliged to keep certain data to fulfil certain legal obligations and matters of record keeping e.g. financial records which we are required to keep for 6 years. Any data that is retained is minimised to ensure that we are keeping only that which is required. We will securely delete all data when it is no longer required.

## 10\. Sharing Your Data

We will not sell or swap your personal data; and it is Compassion’s policy never to pass on your personal details to other organisations for their use, except when we have your express permission to do so or when the law requires it.

At Compassion we work with contracted suppliers and where applicable we will share your information. Your data will only be used under our explicit instructions and only for the purposes we specify, to carry out necessary operations for us, such as sending letters or processing financial transactions. All of our suppliers are trusted and have signed agreements with us, each of them agreeing to respect the security of your personal data. We review the policies and procedures of all third party suppliers to ensure we are satisfied with the level of their compliance with data protection laws, and that their systems are secure. In the event that we stop using a supplier, any of your data that they hold will be securely deleted.

There may be a need to disclose your personal data upon request to regulatory and government bodies as well as law enforcement agencies.
