**Music Labels**  
If you represent a music label and are interested in participating in Loudeye services (e.g., services that allow Loudeye customers access to samples of music in your music catalog or that allow us to include your music when we deliver files to licensed users, such as XM Radio), you can request a service agreement on our site. When you request an agreement, we will ask you for the name of your label and any sublabels, as well as an address, phone number, fax number, e-mail address and an individual contact name. This information will only be used to send you the agreement you have requested.
