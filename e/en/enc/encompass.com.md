# Privacy Policy

**Making a purchase at Encompassparts.com is 100% safe**  
When we request personal information from you (such as, name, address, phone number, credit card number) it is done on our secure servers. We use industry standard technology to protect confidential information - SSL (Secured Socket Layer) - an advanced encryption technology that makes personal information unreadable as it travels over the internet.

We realize that customers are concerned about how the information they provide on-line will be used. We are committed to protecting your privacy and will use the information we collect about you to process your order and provide a more personalized shopping experience. Please read on for more details regarding our Privacy Policy.

**What information do we collect? How do we use it?**  
When you place an order, we ask you to provide information to complete and fill the order by filling out and submitting an on-line form. This information includes your name, mailing address, e-mail address and credit card information. All information regarding our on-line customers is stored on a highly secured server that is not accessible through the Internet.

Encompassparts.com is committed to the protection of the privacy of its customers and website visitors. Currently, our website systems do not automatically capture any personal information identifiable to you, including your e-mail address, unless you specifically give it to us.

We do not sell our customer lists or customer information to third parties.

To continuously assess the value of our on-line shopping experience, we may track the way customers use our site; however, this information is analyzed only as a whole and not at the individual level. We employ Google tracking technology within the shopping cart strictly to analyze sales volume. No personal information is being recorded or used in any way.
