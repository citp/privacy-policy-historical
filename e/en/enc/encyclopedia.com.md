_III. Information We Collect and How We Collect It_

A. We collect information in the following ways: (i) we collect information you submit via the Service; (ii) we collect information we derive from your use of the Service; and (iii) we collect information we obtain from Social Networking Services (defined below) when you connect to Service via your social media account. The information we gather enables us to personalize, improve and continue to operate the Service.

B. In connection with the Service, we collect the following types of information from and about you, including:

  1. Account Information. Certain features of the Service may require you to create a user account (an “Account”). If you create an Account with us, you will be asked to provide information such as your name, username, password, postal address email address, gender, date of birth, photo and location.
  2. Information from Social Networking Services. By registering for an Account, you will have the option to sign in using third party social networking services, such as Facebook or Twitter (“Social Networks”). You will also have the option of connecting to Social Networks to complete your profile information and populate your Account with additional information from your social media profile. If you choose to sign in through these Social Networks or connect your Account to these Social Networks, we use information you have already provided to such Social Network to register you for an Account and which you have allowed such Social Networks to share with BM, including, but not limited to, your first name, your user profile picture, your friends and contacts list, your gender, and the networks to which you belong (collectively, your “Submitted Information”). We advise you to carefully read the terms of use and privacy policies of Social Networks.
  3. User Content. Among other features, the Service will allow you to view, create, reproduce, display, perform and share certain content. Other features of the Service allow you to submit content, which includes videos, audio, images, graphics, written posts, comments and other forms of multimedia (collectively, “User Content”). In addition, your User Content is posted and transmitted at your own risk. We cannot control the actions of other users of the Service with whom you choose to share User Content. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that your User Content will not be viewed by unauthorized persons.
  4. Technical Usage Information. When you use the Services we will automatically collect information sent to us by your computer, mobile phone, or other access device. This information includes:
    * IP addresses and Device IDs, and we will collect and monitor other data and information relating to your device, mobile network and standard web information about your activities on the Service such as your browser type and the pages you access on our Site. We gather and monitor this data to analyze trends, administer the Service, identify users when they visit or use the Service, track users’ movements when using of the Service, and gather anonymized demographic information for aggregate use. We will also use the IP addresses and Device IDs to geo-target advertisements.
    * We will use web beacons/GIF, pixel tags and/or other data and analytics, which are instrumentation tools that help us to determine, for instance, whether a page has been viewed or not and, if so, how many times. When you ask us to send you information on a promotion or a newsletter, we will use web beacons to establish how many of the emails are actually opened. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon. We will use web beacons to collect web usage analytics and we will use similar tools to collect such information from mobile devices.
    * When you visit portions of the Service, the server housing the applicable pages automatically generates a “session log”. We use session logs to help us determine how people travel through the Service. In this way, we can structure our pages so that the information most frequently visited is easier to find. By tracking page visits, we can also determine if the information we're providing is being used. The only data gathered is the IP address from which you came, the source that referred you, the Device ID, the pages you visited and/or the date and time of those visits.
    * Users can be directed to the Service via banner ads or site links or mobile ads. Ads or website links that are placed by the Service will use cookies or web beacons to deliver metrics on the effectiveness of the ads or links.

As used herein, Ad Networks may include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and data research firms.

Cookies, which are small text files recorded in a user's hard drive, are employed by thousands of sites to enhance users' web viewing. Cookies cannot damage user files, nor can they read information from a user's hard drive. Cookies allow sites and advertisers to “remember” users across pages of a site and across multiple visits to a site. We use session and persistent cookies for remembering user preferences and current session information. Because of our use of cookies, we can deliver faster service, more consistent, updated results, and a more personalized site. In addition to cookies that are strictly necessary to operate the Site, we use the following cookies:

  * (a) Functional cookies, which enhance your experience on our Site (e.g. remember what language you speak).
  * (b) Performance Cookies, including provided by Google Analytics (see below for further information), which enable us to provide a better user experience based on how you use our Site.

You have certain options to control or restrict which information we share with advertisers, Ad Networks or other Third Party Services (as defined in Section X ( _ _Third Party Services__ )). These options depend on whether the information is collected through the Site or the App.

A.  _ _Options for the Site__. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, however you may visit our Cookie Settings

 and set your cookie preferences. We or our vendors or content partners use several common online tracking tools, including browser and flash cookies, web beacons and similar technologies, to personalize your experience on the Service, provide measurement services, and serve you targeted advertisements. Most browsers allow you to change your cookie settings. These settings will typically be found in the “options” or “preferences” menu of your browser; otherwise you should use the “Help” option in your browser for more details. Some web browsers have a "Do Not Track" feature that lets the browser specify that a user does not want to have their online activities tracked.

Like many services, Google Analytics uses first-party cookies to track user interactions, as in our case, where they are used to collect information about how users use our site. This information is used to compile reports and to help us improve our Website. The reports disclose website trends without identifying individual visitors. You can opt out of Google Analytics without affecting how you visit our site – for more information on opting out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites you use, visit this Google page: [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).
