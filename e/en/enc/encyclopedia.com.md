**Privacy Policy for ENCYCLOPEDIA.COM™**  
Alacritude, LLC respects the privacy of our users. We have created this policy in order to demonstrate our privacy commitment to our users. By coming to a Alacritude site, you are agreeing to and accepting this Privacy Policy as well as the terms and conditions or other end user agreement for that site.

  * We will not distribute information that identifies you individually or reveals your identity ("Identifying Information") unless you give your prior approval in response to a request made by Alacritude or unless distribution of this information is permitted under this Privacy Policy. Your electronic approval will qualify as your consent for this purpose.
  * We will not make Identifying Information available publicly without the prior written or electronic consent of the individual identified unless (a) the information is already publicly available; (b) required by law, court order, or as requested by other government or law enforcement authority; or (c) the information is posted by the user to an on-line bulletin board, chat room, news groups, or other public forum.
  * We may collect and use information about you and your use of the Alacritude sites, including Identifying Information, for our own internal purposes such as, for example, analyzing usage of the Alacritude sites in order to improve them. 
  * We may use and/or distribute information about you and your use of the Alacritude sites in forms that do not identify you individually or reveal your identity. 
  * Advertisements, promotional offers, promotional emails, "free gifts," and links, for example, on the Alacritude sites or sent via email or other means from Alacritude may ask for Identifying Information from you. If you provide this information, your Identifying Information may be provided (either directly from you or by Alacritude) to the advertiser or web site or company making the offer or providing the gift. You may opt-out regarding how Identifying Information collected from you may be used or distributed when provided to Alacritude at a Alacritude site by either following the applicable instructions and links on the site, in the email or other document, or by sending an email to the Alacritude site Web Master at info@encyclopedia.com or as otherwise posted on the Alacritude sites. To ensure that your opt-out email is effective, you must include the words "opt-out" and "Identifying Information" in the subject field of such email. 
  * Of course, if you make a purchase by credit card or otherwise provide your credit card information, the relevant data will be transmitted to Alacritude's vendor providing such payment processing service. Similarly, if you are using a co-branded site of Alacritude and at least one other third party (indicated by the inclusion of another party's name or product/service name either in the URL or site or by the inclusion of a third party's(ies') logos or trademarks in the site), your Identifying Information may be used and/or distributed by Alacritude pursuant to this Privacy Policy and by the other party(ies) pursuant to this Policy and/or their applicable policy(ies).
  * Alacritude may send users, via email or other means, information relating to Alacritude sites and/or information on specials, new products and/or promotions from our marketing partners/colleagues. The information described in these messages is intended to be of high interest or value to our users. To choose not to receive such messages, a user can simply click or go to a URL link located in every email or other message containing this kind of information, which will remove the user from future mailings. Or, for certain sites a user may edit his/her personal account information, which contains an option on receiving special offers, at any time by clicking the appropriate link on the applicable Alacritude site. 
  * In the course of our business, Alacritude might buy or sell sites or assets. In these kinds of transactions, customer information (such as Identifying Information) is usually one of the transferred business assets.

  * Alacritude may use other companies and persons to perform certain functions for us. These functions might include, for example, processing credit card payments, providing customer service, and sending email. These other companies and persons may have access to customer information (such as Identifying Information) that's needed to perform their functions, but they are not authorized to use it for any other purposes. In addition, we may share information with other affiliated companies and joint ventures, for example, but we ask those companies to honor the standards of this Privacy Policy.
