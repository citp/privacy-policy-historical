**Information Tracked**  
At times we will use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our web site. We also may track browser types to help us understand our visitors' needs related to our web site design.  
There is an optional section of our web site where input forms require your name, phone number, company, and e-mail address. This form provides the ability to opt-in to receiving future emails of any sort from Ecole hôtelière de Lausanne. If you opt-in to receiving email communications from us, then we may send information to you on our products or services.  
This information will not be used for any other purpose.

**Web Beacons**  
In order to determine a user's ability to receive HTML email in addition to whether or not an email has been opened, Ecole hôtelière de Lausanne includes a “web beacon” in a majority of the HTML email messages we send. A web beacon (actually a small .gif image) is activated when an HTML email is opened via a request for the image on our servers.  
This capability helps Ecole hôtelière de Lausanne send email in a format users can read and enables Ecole hôtelière de Lausanne, and our clients that use the functionality, to track the aggregate number of emails opened. The web beacon does not collect any personally identifiable information. Users that do not want to receive email messages with web beacons can choose to receive their emails in text (non-HTML) format.  
We also use, and provide our clients with, the capability to track when a URL has been clicked inside of an email message sent by our system. We use this functionality to track which links were clicked and in what quantity, as well as the aggregate number of links clicked. This click tracking functionality does not collect any personally identifiable information.

**Cookies**  
Client-side cookies are used to verify the login status of customers using products or services linked directly with our website. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site; however, the user may not be able to access all areas of our site.

Ecole hôtelière de Lausanne is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any other web sites to which we link.
