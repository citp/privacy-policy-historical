## General

We only collect personally identifiable information on a voluntary basis. We do not require that you provide this information to gain access to our sites, and we do not require you to disclose more information than is reasonably needed to participate in an activity on our sites. We collect personally identifiable information primarily to e-mail updates and news, for entry into promotions and to notify subsequent winners, to send out brochures, etc. via regular mail to subscribers, and to respond to your questions or suggestions. We do not sell any information we gather at our web sites to anyone outside of EHBOX, and its affiliates. We do not transfer or disclose any information we gather at our web sites to anyone outside of EHBOX, and its affiliates, without your prior consent, except (1) in cases where we believe in good faith that we have a legal obligation to disclose such information, and (2) to certain suppliers that assist EHBOX, and it's affiliates, in maintaining and managing the activities on its web sites. Please be assured that these suppliers are legally obligated to maintain the confidentiality of this information and do not acquire any rights to use your information for their own benefit. We may share non-identifiable aggregate information about our users (for example, the % of male and female visitors to our sites) with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties in an effort to customize or enhance the content and advertising on our sites for our users.

We do reserve the right, in connection with the potential sale or transfer of the interests of EHBOX and its subsidiaries and affiliates, to sell or transfer your information (including but not limited to your address, name, age, gender, zip code, state, and country of residency and other information that your provide through other communications) to a third party entity that (1) concentrates its business in a similar practice or service, (2) agrees to be EHBOX successor in interest with regard to the maintenance and protection of the information collected, and (3) agrees to the obligations of this privacy policy.

You are not identified by name or e-mail address, just by a unique string of numbers that we assign the first time you come to our site.

## Security

We employ appropriate security measures to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. For our EHBOX.com site, we employ Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input, as an additional security measure.
