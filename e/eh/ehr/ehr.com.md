Watson Wyatt Worldwide believes strongly in protecting the privacy of its users. We collect personal information only when necessary.

We do not collect any personal information about users of our web site unless they take advantage of its customization features. We collect only aggregate information about the behavior of web visitors in order to improve the quality of the site.

**Collection of personal information.** In some cases, we may ask you for personal information. 

  * **Customization** : Some areas of the site can be customized according to user preferences. We use individual preferences only to deliver custom content online and analyze aggregate preferences in order to improve site quality.  



  * **Publication orders** : If a user orders a publication, their personal information will be used to fulfill the order, and may be shared with third parties involved in fulfilling your order (a printer, for instance).


  * **Event registration** : If a user registers for an event on-line, their personal information will be used to fulfill that request, and may be shared with third parties involved with the event (a hotel, for instance).


  * **E-mail** : If you send an e-mail message to us, we will use your e-mail address and other information you provide to respond to your request.


  * **Subscriptions** : If you subscribe to one of our online publications, we use the information you provide to send you e-mail updates. You can unsubscribe at any time.


  * **Surveys** : The information we collect in online surveys is used for internal research purposes. In general, we do not divulge individual responses to surveys except for participant names. Exceptions to this policy are noted when users access particular surveys. Third parties administer some of our surveys, but they cannot use any of the individual data they help collect.

On occasion, we may share responses with a co-sponsor who works with us to analyze the data; in this case, we expect the co-sponsor to maintain the same level of confidentiality with individual responses.



  * **Registered areas** : **** Some areas of eHR.com require registration and/or payment for access. We do not track individual usage within these areas of the site except to audit security.



**Cookies**. For general users of the site, we do not use "cookies" to save personal information. Cookies are used only during a user session (to maintain a shopping cart, for instance). 

We do use persistent cookies to identify users who choose to save their identification between site visits. We do not save personally identifiable information in cookies. We do not use third-party cookies, with the exception of watsonwyatt.com, which hosts some of our images.

**Third parties**. We do not share or sell the information you provide with parties outside of Watson Wyatt Worldwide, with the following exceptions: to fulfill user requests for publications, for event registrations and for co-sponsored surveys. Any data we collect, however, may be transferred internationally throughout Watson Wyatt Worldwide for internal purposes only.

**Modification** : This privacy policy is subject to change. All changes will be posted on this page.
