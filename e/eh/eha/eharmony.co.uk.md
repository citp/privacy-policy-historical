## General Information

**Welcome to eHarmony! At eHarmony ("we", "us", "our") we value your privacy and trust, so we’re providing you with all the information in this Privacy Policy about how we handle your data, who we share it with, your rights around the data, and our company, as well as our products and applications (including eHarmony's mobile applications, downloadable products and applications and pages operated by eHarmony on social networking sites and other platforms) (collectively, the "Services").**

This Privacy Policy applies beginning May 25, 2018. The previous version of this [Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/privacy/pre-gdpr), available here, will apply until then.

**EFFECTIVE DATE: 25 May 2018.**

For the purposes of EU data protection laws (" **Data Protection Legislation** "), eHarmony UK Ltd is the data controller (i.e. the company which is responsible for, and controls the processing of, your personal data)

## 1\. Where this Privacy Policy applies

This Privacy Policy applies to websites, apps, events and other services operated by eHarmony. For simplicity, we refer to all of these as our " **Service** " in this Privacy Policy.

Some services may require their own unique privacy policy. If a particular service has its own privacy policy, then that policy - not this Privacy Policy - applies.

## 2\. What Information We Collect

We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you which we have grouped together follows: 

  * **Information You Provide**. When you register, use or subscribe to any of our Services or take part in any interactive features of the Services (such as any contests, games, promotions, quizzes, surveys, research or other services or features), we may collect a variety of information, including: 
    * **"Contact Data"** such as your name, email address, and phone number 
    * **"Profile Data"**. " when you complete your profile, you can share with us additional information, such as details on your personality, lifestyle, interests, demographic information, place of work or education, gender, age, dating age range preference, physical characteristics, personal description, life experiences, geographic location and other details about you, as well as content such as photos and videos. To add certain content, like pictures or videos (" **Photos** "), you may allow us to access your camera or photo album. Some of the information you choose to provide us may be considered "special" or "sensitive" in certain jurisdictions, for example your racial or ethnic origins, sexual orientation and religious beliefs. **By choosing to provide this information, you consent to our processing of that information.**
    * **"Transaction Data"**. such as when you subscribe to a paid service or make a purchase directly from us, you provide us or our payment service provider with information, such as your debit or credit card number or other financial information including, for example, expiration date, name, address, transaction ID, timestamps, and email address. Credit card transactions are processed through industry standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and / or strong encryption (3DES) by a third party, which only uses your information for that purpose. 
    * **Information from Content You Upload**. When you upload photos, videos or other content to the Services, we may collect information about the content, such as the time, date and place the photo or content was taken or uploaded (also known as metadata), and how you use them, who views them or with whom you share. We may also scan and analyse the photos you provide to us using third party services for several purposes, including for anti-fraud purposes, for the assessment of whether the photos are consistent with our Terms of Service, to help identify your interests and activities, such as if your photo includes pets, sports, or trips, and to help us provide better matches for you. 
    * **"Communications Data"**. if you contact our customer care team, we will collect the information you give us during the interaction. Sometimes, we monitor or record these interactions for training purposes and to ensure a high quality of service. Of course, we also process your chats with other users as well as the content you publish, as part of the operation of the Services. 
    * When you participate in surveys or focus groups, you give us your insights into our products and services, responses to our questions and testimonials. 
    * When you choose to participate in our promotions, events or contests, we collect the information that you use to register or enter. 
    * Where you choose to disclose your comments in the comments section (if any) of our Advice blog. Our Advice blog is made up of posts that are relevant to dating and relationships and is available to our users and visitors. Please consult our Community Guidelines when posting comments on the Advice discussion boards. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at [eHadvicealerts@eHarmony.co.uk](mailto:eHadvicealerts@eHarmony.co.uk). 
  * **Information Automatically Collected**. When you access our Services, we and our third party partners automatically record information from your device and its software, such as your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, platform type, the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave our website, date and time stamp and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your account. When you access our Services using a mobile device, we may also receive or collect identification numbers associated with your device (such as a unique device ID, IDFA, Google AdID), device type, model and manufacturer, mobile device operating system brand and model, phone number, email address, and other apps that you have downloaded (" **Technical Data** "). We also collect information about your usage of, and activity on, our Services (" **Usage Data** "). 
  * **Information About How You Use the Services**. We may collect information about your participation and actions on the Services. This may include information such as the pages and profiles you view, how you browse the Services and dating insights. It can also include the various functions and features that you use, the connections you make, other friends or contacts you invite to the Services and profile searches you perform, or your use of our applications. 
  * **Location Data**. We do not currently collect your precise geolocation or any latitude or longitude coordinates for you. Some of the information we collect, for example an IP address, can sometimes be used to approximate a device’s location. In some cases, we assign the latitude and longitude of the centre of a city or state on record for you to your profile as a way to improve our analytics and matches for you. This is a general latitude and longitude and does not correspond to your real time or historical location specifically. 
  * **Information Provided by Others**. We may be provided with information relating to you or your conduct on the Services by other users of the Services. For example, we will collect your email address if another user tries to refer eHarmony to you. We also collect information that third-party organizations may provide to us, such as contact details, demographic information, Internet navigation details (for example, how your mouse moves on a screen, which tells us if you are a bot or not) or fraud prevention information. Financial institutions or payment processors may also provide us updated payment information or payment methods related to your paid account or paid subscription and services. 



We may link or combine the personal data we collect about you and the information we collect automatically. This allows us to provide you with a personalised experience regardless of how you interact with us.

We may anonymise and aggregate any of the personal data we collect (so that it does not directly identify you). We may use anonymised information for our business purposes including testing our IT systems, research, data analysis, improving our Services and developing new products and features. We may also share such anonymised information with others.

Where you do not provide the personal data detailed in this Privacy Policy, we may not be able to provide you with the Services.
