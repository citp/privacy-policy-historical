			<h1 class="Heading1 Underline"><span class="line">Demand Media, Inc. Privacy and Information Security Policy</span></h1>

			<div class="PrimaryContent content">
				<p><strong>Effective Date: February 2, 2011</strong></p>
				<p> We are Demand Media, Inc ("<strong>Demand Media</strong>", "we", "us" or "our").</p>

			<p> Demand Media is committed to protecting your privacy and providing a safe online experience for all our
				users. This Privacy Policy ("<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>" or the "<strong>Policy</strong>") sets out how we use and process your
				personal information (meaning any information about you which is personally identifiable or can be
				related back to you like your name or email address) ("<strong>PII</strong>") that we have access to when you use the services we provide at <a href="http://www.ehow.co.uk">http://www.ehow.co.uk</a>, which includes all of the ehow.co.uk
				articles and videos and other services we provide on the website (collectively, the "Site"). Please
				read the complete Policy below and contact us if you have any questions.</p>

			<p> Because protecting your privacy is important to us, we adhere to the Safe Harbor Agreement concerning the transfer of personal data from the European Union ("EU") to the United States of America. Accordingly, we follow the Safe Harbor Principles published by the U.S. Department of Commerce ("Principles") with respect to all PII that we receive. If there is any conflict between the policies in this statement and the Principles, the Principles will govern. This statement outlines our general policy and practices for implementing the Principles, including the types of information we receive, how we use it, and the choices affected individuals have regarding our use of, and their ability to correct, that information.</p>
			<p> This privacy statement applies to all PII we receive (except as noted below). For purposes of this privacy statement, PII includes information that:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>is transferred from the EU to the United States;</li>
			<li>is recorded in any form;</li>
			<li>is about, or pertains to, a specific individual; and </li>
			<li>can be linked to that individual.</li>
			</ul>
			<p> It does not include information that pertains to a specific individual, but from which that individual could not reasonably be identified.</p>

			<p> If you are not comfortable with this Privacy Policy, please do not provide us with PII or other
				information or content or otherwise use the Site.</p>

			<ol class="content">
			<li>What information may be collected by us, and how is it collected? 
			<p><strong>Type of Information We Collect</strong>. 
			We use Facebook Login so you can use your existing Facebook.com account to access the features of the Site.  You must explicitly authorize Facebook to share your information with us when you first login to the Site with your Facebook credentials.</p>
			<p>You should review your privacy settings on your Facebook account because those settings determine and govern what PII may be made available to us when you access the Site.  While Facebook Login allows us to access a variety of information about you based on your Facebook account’s privacy settings, we only access PII which we feel is useful to enhance your experience of the Site, including your name, gender and location.</p>
			<p>If you formerly maintained a user profile on the Site through a predecessor user registration form, that user profile will no longer be accessible.  Demand Media will only retain former user profile information to the extent we feel it is necessary to contact you and keep you updated about material changes to the Site.</p>  
			<p>We may collect any information you enter on the Site or give us in any other way (such as through an email, survey, or letter). The information that we collect varies depending upon how you use our Site.  
			</p>

			<p><strong>Information in Public Areas of the Site</strong>. Please keep in mind that whenever
				you voluntarily provide information in public areas of the Site, that information can be viewed and possibly used by others. We therefore
				advise users not to disclose contact information, including phone number, email address,
				street address or instant messenger address (within these public areas) that they do not
				wish to share. We are not responsible for PII you choose to submit in these public areas.
			</p>

			<p><strong>Cookies</strong>. Like many websites, we use "cookies." Cookies are alphanumeric
				identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to
				enable our systems to recognize your browser. We use persistent, identifying cookies to
				remember your information and to link your activities to you. While you can take steps to
				warn off, block or disable cookies, if you do, the Site may not function and appear as we
				have designed it. Nonetheless, if you want to take these steps, you can do so by following
				the instructions associated with your browser. For more information about cookies, including
				controlling and deleting them, please visit the <a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org">www.aboutcookies.org</a> website.</p>

			<p> Our cookies do not collect PII that you provide to us during the registration process, but
				they do collect other information such as the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>the domain name and host from which you access the Internet and the Internet address of
					the site from which you direct-linked to ours;
				</li>
				<li>the date and time you access the Site and pages you visit;</li>
				<li>your computer's IP address and information about its operating system, platform and the
					Web browser type and version you use;
				</li>
				<li>demographic and other non-personally identifiable profile information about you; and
				</li>
				<li>information to combat fraud or misuse.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Pixel Tags</strong>. In our emails to you, we may use "pixel tags" to determine if
				your email software or service can display html-formatted email (this helps us optimize the
				size of our email messages and conserve bandwidth).</p>

			<p><strong>Collection of Information by Third Parties</strong>. Our Site may include third-party
				advertising, links to other websites, and other content from third party businesses. The
				content posted by these parties will be reasonably identifiable as coming from a third
				party. We do not provide any PII to these advertisers, third-party websites, or other
				businesses, although on occasion we may mutually share non-personally identifiable (e.g.
				demographic) information to facilitate delivery of relevant advertisements. These
				third-party websites, businesses, and advertisers, or advertising companies working on their
				behalf, sometimes use technology to deliver (or "serve") the advertisements that appear on
				our Site directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this
				happens. They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (also known as action tags or
				single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to
				personalize or optimize advertising content. We do not have access to or control over
				cookies or other technologies that they may use, and the information practices of these
				advertisers and third-party websites or businesses are not covered by this Policy but are
				covered by their respective privacy policies. Some, but not all, third party advertising
				companies provide a mechanism to opt-out of their technology.</p>

			<p><strong>Promotions, Sweepstakes, and Contests</strong>. From time to time, we may host a
				promotion, sweepstake, or contest on the Site. You may be asked to provide PII or permit the
				transfer to a third party of your PII in connection with such promotion, sweepstake or
				contest. It will be disclosed at the point of collection or transfer who is collecting or
				transferring the information and whose privacy statement applies, and it will be your choice
				whether or not you wish to permit such transfer or collection of PII to a third party.</p>
			</li>
			<li>What Do We Do With Collected Information? <p><strong>Use of PII</strong>. We may use your PII for
			purposes such as responding to your requests, monitoring and providing the Site, maintaining
			your account, providing you with advertising and non-advertising content on the Site that we
			believe would be of interest to you, enforcing our rights and the rights of third parties, and
			investigating and ensuring compliance with the <a href="http://www.ehow.co.uk/terms-of-use.html">Terms of Use</a>.
			</p>

			<p><strong>Opting-Out</strong>. Users can unsubscribe from any newsletters or opt out of various
				promotional e-mailings they may have consented to at any time by sending an e-mail to the
				same address, or by clicking on "unsubscribe" links in each of our newsletters or emails. We
				reserve the right to send you customary business communications such as acceptance/rejection
				notices regarding content submissions, general system and administrative messages regarding
				the Site, address confirmations, and transactional information about your account, and we
				may not offer you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving such communications so long as you
				are registered with the Site. However, we provide you with the opportunity to choose not to
				receive other types of communications, such as friend requests or the eHow of the day
				messages. If you want to update your email address or stop receiving our eHow of the day
				messages, you may opt out these messages by following the unsubscribe link at the bottom of
				the email, or visiting the "Edit My Settings" page on the Site. You may also opt-out of
				receiving email notifications of friend requests on this page.</p>

			<p><strong>Use of Other Information</strong>. We use non-PII about our users for purposes such
				as measuring the number of visitors to sections of our Site, making the Site more useful to
				visitors and delivering targeted advertising and non-advertising content. We use IP
				addresses to analyze trends, administer the Site, track a user's movement, and gather broad
				demographic information for aggregate, non-personally identifiable use.</p>

			<p><strong>Retention of Information</strong>. We retain information for as long as is necessary.
				We advise that you keep your own, separate back-up records of any of your PII or other
				information.</p></li>
			<li>Does Demand Media Share Information With Other Parties? <p> We share information with third
			parties, but only as described in this Section 3.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Advertisers and Others</strong>. We share non-personally identifiable
					information with advertisers, service providers, and other persons with whom we conduct
					business. Similarly, these advertisers, service providers, and other persons may share
					with us non-PII about you that they have independently gathered or acquired.
				</li>
				<li><strong>Third Party Services</strong>. We contract with affiliated and non-affiliated
					third parties to provide services to us or to you on our behalf. Examples include
					providing marketing assistance, providing customer service, sending emails to you,
					removing repetitive information from customer lists, and analysing data. These third
					parties may have access to your PII, but will be required to use this information solely
					in connection with these authorised business activities.
				</li>
				<li><strong>Business Transfer</strong>. As we develop our business, we might sell or buy
					businesses or their assets, or engage in transfers, acquisitions, mergers,
					restructurings, changes of control or similar transactions. In such transactions,
					customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets, and your PII
					may be subject to such a transfer. Also, in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy, PII may
					be transferred to a bankruptcy trustee or debtor in possession and then to a subsequent
					purchaser.
				</li>
				<li><strong>Affiliates</strong>. We may share PII, non-PII and other information with our
					corporate affiliates. Some of our most significant affiliates are identified on the
					website of our parent company, Demand Media, Inc. <a href="http://www.demandmedia.com/">http://www.demandmedia.com</a>.
					Corporate affiliates are those entities that we control, are controlled by us, or are
					under common control with us and any joint venture in which any of the controlled
					entities may participate from time to time. Any use of your information by our corporate
					affiliates is subject to this Policy or another policy no less protective of your
					privacy. Conversely, we may obtain information about you from our corporate affiliates
					or from your visits to other websites that we or our corporate affiliates control.
				</li>
				<li><strong>Compliance and Safety</strong>. We may release user information when we believe
					release is appropriate to:
					<ul class="BulletList">
						<li>comply with applicable law, and to respond to legal requests and to respond to
							or otherwise address written complaints of copyright infringement;
						</li>
						<li>make disclosures under programs intended to prevent potential crimes or
							investigate persons;
						</li>
						<li>enforce or apply agreements, including the Terms and Conditions of Use; or</li>
						<li>protect the rights, property, or safety of our Site, our users, or others,
							including exchanging information with other companies for fraud protection and
							credit risk reduction.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>How Secure Is My Information? <p><strong>Your Obligations</strong>. You must protect against
			unauthorised access to your password and to your computer. Please sign off when you have
			finished using a shared computer. Your emails to us are not necessarily secure against
			interception so do not include sensitive information in them. We generally will not ask for
			passwords in an email and you should assume that if you get such a request, it might be
			fraudulent. YOU MUST DO WHAT YOU REASONABLY CAN TO ENSURE THE SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL
			INFORMATION.</p>

			<p><strong>Our Security Measures</strong>. We take reasonable precautions to protect the
				security of our users' information. We have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures
				to help safeguard, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use
				your information. However, neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including
				encryption systems. In addition, people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail
				to follow policies. Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to protect your PII, we
				cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p></li>
			<li>What About Links to Other Sites? <p> The Site contains links to other sites. We are not
			responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you
			leave our Site and to read the privacy statements of every web site that collects your PII. This
			Policy applies only to information collected by the Site.</p></li>
			<li>What Does Demand Media Do When This Privacy Policy Changes? <p> We reserve the right to change our
			Policy at any time. Non-material changes and clarifications will take effect immediately. If we
			make non-material changes, we will indicate at the top of this page the revised Policy's new
			effective date. If we make material changes, we will notify you by email or through notice on
			the home page of the Site, and will also indicate so at the top of this page. The material
			changes will take effect 30 days after such notice. We encourage you to refer to this Policy at
			least every 30 days to check for material changes to this Policy.</p></li>
			<li>Transfers Overseas <p> Your PII may be transferred outside of the European Economic Area to us
			for processing.</p>

			<p>Any transfer of your PII is done in circumstances ensuring that your data is processed only in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p></li>
			<li>What If I Have Other Questions Or Concerns About Privacy Or This Policy? 
			<p>We utilize the self-assessment approach to assure our compliance with our privacy statement. We periodically verify that the policy is accurate, comprehensive for the information intended to be covered, prominently displayed, completely implemented, and in conformity with the Principles. We encourage interested persons to raise any concerns with us using the contact information below. We will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of personal information in accordance with the principles contained in this policy.</p>
			<p><strong>Privacy
			Concerns</strong>. If you have any concern or complaint about privacy at the Site, please
			contact us at Demand Media, Inc. Legal Department, 15801 NE 24th Street, Bellevue, WA 98008,
			U.S.A or email us at <a href="mailto:legal@demandmedia.com">legal@demandmedia.com</a>. We will
			do our best to respond to you in a timely and professional manner to answer your questions and
			resolve your concerns. In the unfortunate and unlikely event that we cannot resolve your
			concerns, we have contracted with BBBOnline as a dispute resolution provider. You can contact
			the BBBOnline at <a href="http://www.bbbonline.org/consumer/complaint.asp">http://www.bbbonline.org/consumer/complaint.asp</a>
			and follow their guidelines for initiating their dispute resolution procedures. </p>

				relating to this Policy), you may email via our <a href="http://help.ehow.com/home">contact form</a>.</p></li>
