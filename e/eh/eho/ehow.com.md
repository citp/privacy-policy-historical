**Cookies**   
eHow uses a feature of your browser to set a "cookie" on your computer. Cookies can help you save time. If you personalize pages or register for products and/or services, a cookie helps remember who you are. Cookies are commonly used to rotate banner ads that a site sends so that it doesn't keep sending the same ad as it sends you a succession of requested pages. They can also be used to customize pages for you based on your browser type or other information you may have provided the Web Site. In addition, for those sites which provide a "shopping cart", a cookie can store all of the items you place in your shopping cart and facilitate quick and easy checkout. Web users must agree to let cookies be saved for them, but, in general, it helps Web Sites to serve users better. Cookies will also save your password so that you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit eHow.com. 

Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to find out the identity of any user. If, for some reason, you would rather not take advantage of the benefits made possible with cookies, most browsers allow you to reject cookies or to choose which cookies to accept. You can order your browser to accept all cookies or to alert you every time a cookie is offered. Then, you can decide whether to accept one or not.

If you decline the accept cookies, it is possible that the site attempting to place the cookie or cookies may continue to ask for permission. In addition, failure to accept cookies may prevent you from accessing certain parts of the site. 

You may elect to tell us things that you want eHow to remember about you. We hope that you will want to provide information about yourself because it will make eHow that much more valuable to you. If you are comfortable providing us with information about yourself, premium services are available to you that are impossible for us to offer anonymous users. Examples of such premium services are: My eHow and the eHow newsletters. In these instances, we retain information about you in a secure environment between computing sessions by using a cookie. 

Other companies which place advertising and/or links on our site also have the ability to assign a different cookie to you in a process that eHow does not control. However, since cookies cannot identify individual users, these advertisers will never know who you are. 

**Registration**   
eHow does not currently require a user to register. In the future, additional services may be provided in which registration is required. At that time we will require the following two pieces of personally identifiable information: Your e-mail address and a password of your choosing. In addition, you may choose to share additional information (such as "areas of interest" and other information as detailed in the "Collecting Information" section below) with us which we may use to send you information about eHow and promotional materials (based on what you've shared with us) if we think you might be interested. The choice of how much personally identifiable information about yourself to disclose to eHow is completely up to you.

This information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis, but never on an individual basis. (For example, we may notify our advertisers that 100 customers clicked on their banner ad, but will not disclose any information about those 100 individuals.) We may also use this data for internal purposes. Please note that when we sponsor a contest or sweepstakes with another party, the other party may also collect your information, but only with your consent. 

**Collecting Information**   
eHow collects personal information in several sections of the eHow.com site:
