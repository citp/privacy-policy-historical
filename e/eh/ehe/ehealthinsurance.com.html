collect, use, share and secure the personal information you provide. It also describes your choices
regarding use, access and correction of your personal information.</p>
<p class="section__body">At eHealthInsurance, we are strongly committed to protecting your privacy. To serve as
your licensed insurance agent, we will ask you to provide us with personal information about you. We use
your personal information to help you find and, if you choose to do so, apply for health insurance and
other products that may be of interest to you and your family. We only use and disclose your personal
information in accordance with our Policy. Additionally, we use industry-leading technologies to ensure the
security and confidentiality of the personal information you provide us. Throughout this Policy, we refer
to information that can identify you as a specific individual, such as your name, phone number, email
address, Social Security number or credit card number, as “personal information”.</p>
<p class="section__body">Further, personal information includes any information about your health or medical
history that you may provide us in a health insurance application or any financial or other sensitive
personal information that you may provide us in an application to obtain an advanced premium tax credit (or
“subsidy”) determination from the government. If you provide information directly to one of our partners or
any other third party, then your information would be governed by such other party’s privacy policy.</p>
<p class="section__body">If you have questions or concerns regarding our privacy policy or practices, please
contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@ehealthinsurance.com">privacy@ehealthinsurance.com</a>. If you have
an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our

<h2 class="section__header text--hanging-indent">1. We do not disclose your personal information to third
parties, unless one of the following limited exceptions applies.</h2>
<p class="section__subheader">Insurance Companies, Licensed Agents and Business Partners, HSA Trustees or
Administrators, and Government-run Exchanges and Entities</p>
<p class="section__body">If you submit an application for an insurance product offered by us, then we will
disclose your personal information to your chosen insurance company to process your application. If you
submit a request for information or an application for an insurance product offered through an
insurance agent, agency or other business partner with whom we associate or contract, then we may
disclose your personal information to that agent, agency or business partner to process your request
for information or application or to otherwise provide you with information about insurance products
(including contacting you by telephone, email, or otherwise to discuss insurance products in which you
may be interested). If you complete an enrollment form for a health savings account (“HSA”) offered
through an authorized HSA trustee or administrator with whom we have associated, then we may disclose
your personal information to that trustee or administrator to enroll you in an HSA. If you complete an
application with us that is processed through a government-run exchange or other government-run entity,
we will disclose your personal information to that government-run exchange or entity. Please be assured
that these partners are only allowed to use your personal information to process your requested quote,
application or enrollment form and are legally obligated to maintain strict confidentiality.</p>
<p class="section__subheader">Service Providers</p>
<p class="section__body">We may disclose your personal information to other companies that help us to
process or service any application you begin, process or submit through us, or to correspond with you.
For example, we may provide your personal information to a service provider to verify the validity or
credit limit of your credit card. Please be assured that the companies we hire to process or service
your insurance application or correspond with you are not allowed to use your personal information for
their own purposes and are contractually obligated to maintain strict confidentiality.</p>
<p class="section__subheader">Employers, Affinity Groups, and Benefits Administrators or Consultants</p>
<p class="section__body">If you were referred to us by, or use our website or call center in connection
with, a current or former employer, affinity group, or other organization with which you may be
affiliated (or a benefits administrator or consultant associated with such employer, group or
organization), we may disclose your personal information to such employer, group, organization,
administrator and/or consultant. For example, we may inform such employer, group, organization,
administrator and/or consultant whether or not you have enrolled in a plan. Please be assured that
these parties are only allowed to use your personal information as permitted by applicable law.</p>
<p class="section__subheader">Legal Obligations</p>
<p class="section__body">In certain situations, eHealthInsurance may be required to disclose personal data
in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law
enforcement requirements.)</p>
<p class="section__body">We may also disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to
comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process. We may disclose or report your personal information
when we believe, in good faith, that the disclosure is required or permitted under law, for example, to
cooperate with regulators or law enforcement authorities, to resolve consumer disputes, to protect our
rights, to protect your safety or the safety of others, to investigate fraud, or to otherwise respond
to a government request.</p>
<p class="section__subheader">Business Transition</p>
<p class="section__body">If eHealthInsurance is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a
portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any
change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding
your personal information.</p>
<p class="section__subheader">Your Consent</p>
<p class="section__body">If you provide us an indication of your consent to disclose, share or use your
personal information in connection with a third party, we may disclose, share or use your personal
information in that manner. For example, if you opt in to our social media mailing lists and
promotional updates, then we may disclose your relevant personal information to social media platforms
where eHealthInsurance has a corporate account for the purpose of adding you to eHealthInsurance’s
social media mailing and promotional update lists. Generally in such a situation, the social media
platforms are not allowed to use your personal information for their own purposes unless you have a
direct account on such social media platforms, in which case your personal information would be handled
by the social media platforms in accordance with the social media platforms’ privacy policies.</p>
<p class="section__subheader">Your Requests for Products</p>
<p class="section__body">If you request to be contacted about any type of insurance product, request to be
contacted by a licensed agent or other representative, request assistance with enrolling in any type of
insurance product or make any other request for someone to contact you (such as by filling out an
online request form), then our agents or representatives may contact you, or we may disclose your
personal information to a third-party insurance agency, insurance agent, insurance company or other
appropriate entity, so that such entity may contact you about any product in which you indicated
interest or may assist you in enrolling in any such product. Any additional information that you
subsequently choose to provide to any third-party entity will be governed by that entity’s privacy
policy.</p>
<p class="section__body"><strong>Outside of these exceptions, we will not sell, trade or share your personal
information with third parties.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="menu-group">
<p class="section__header text--hanging-indent">2. We collect personal information in the normal course of
business in order to process your insurance application and to serve you better.</p>
<p class="section__subheader">Registering With Us</p>
<p class="section__body">We begin collecting personal information from you when you register with us. You
may register with us through our website by entering your email address and, if you are creating an
account, choosing your password. Under our current process, you must create an account in connection
with an application for a health insurance or other product offered on our website. You may also
register with us through our Customer Care Center by providing certain personal or contact information
(e.g., email address, phone number, gender, date of birth) to one of our customer service
representatives.</p>
<p class="section__subheader">Applying for Health Insurance and Other Products</p>
<p class="section__body">If you apply for a health insurance or other product through our website, we may
ask you to provide us with personal information and/or health information relating to you and any
family member who will be included on your application. This information will be used by your chosen
insurance company, agent, HSA trustee or administrator, or government-run exchange or entity to process
your application. Additionally, we may ask you to provide us with your credit card, bank information
and social security number, which will be used by your chosen insurance company or HSA Trustee or
Administrator to process your application or collect any fees associated with your application or
insurance premiums upon approval of your application. If you apply through us for government health
insurance subsidies or for health insurance sold through a government-run exchange, we will ask you for
personal information, including financial, tax filing and household information, that we will pass on
to government-run sites and entities responsible for processing such subsidies and applications.</p>
<p class="section__subheader">Providing you with a quote or processing your application</p>
<p class="section__body">We may use your personal information to get in touch with you when necessary to
process your application or to provide you with a quote. For example, emails will be sent to you
throughout the application process to inform you of the status of your application and to seek
additional information that is requested as part of the application. We may also use phone numbers you
provide to send you telephone or text messages about your application or account, and such messages may
be automatically sent with an autodialer, an artificial or prerecorded voice, or other automation
technology.</p>
<p class="section__subheader">Third Party Data</p>
<p class="section__body">We may receive information about you from other sources, including publicly
available databases or third parties from whom we have obtained data, and combine this data with
information we already have about you. This helps us to update, expand and analyze our records,
identify new customers, and provide products and services that may be of interest to you. Examples of
the types of personal information that may be obtained from public sources or third parties and
combined with information we already have about you, may include: (a) address information from third
party sources to verify your address so we can properly communicate with you and to prevent fraud
and/or (b) data about our customers from third parties that is combined with information we already
have about you, to create more tailored advertising and products.</p>
<p class="section__subheader">Customer satisfaction, referrals and other products</p>
<p class="section__body">We or our wholly-owned subsidiaries may contact you to survey your satisfaction of
our service, refer our products and services to other people, and/or to inform you of additional
products and services. You may opt out of receiving these additional communications from us by
following the opt-out procedures below.</p>
<p class="section__subheader">Collection and Use of 3rd party Personal Information:</p>
<p class="section__body">You may also provide personal information about other people, such as their name,
date of birth and gender. This information is only used for the sole purpose of completing your request
or for whatever reason it may have been provided. The third party may contact us at <a href="mailto:customerservice@ehealthinsurance.com">customerservice@ehealthinsurance.com</a>

services, marketing, analytics, site functionality, service offerings, or for other business needs.</li>
<li class="list__item">The strict restrictions we have in place for personal information do not

change.</li>

<p id="cookies" class="section__subheader">Tracking technologies</p>
<p class="section__body">Cookies or similar technologies are used by us and our business and marketing
partners, affiliates, and/or analytics or service providers. These technologies are used in analyzing
trends, administering this and other sites, tracking users’ movements around this site and other sites,
customizing content on this and other sites, and gathering information about our user base. We may
receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as
aggregated basis.</p>
<p class="section__body">We use cookies on our site for various purposes such as user authentication, user
preferences, our shopping experience, and customizing user experiences. Users can control the use of
cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your
ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited.</p>
<p class="section__body">We use Local Storage, such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences.
Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising
based upon your Web browsing activity use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML 5 or Flash to
collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5
LSOs. To manage Flash LSOs please <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html" target="_blank">click here</a></p>
<p id="targeting" class="section__subheader">Behavioral Targeting / Re-Targeting / Do-Not-Track</p>
<p class="section__body">We partner with one or more third party ad networks to manage and display
advertising to visitors on our website and to manage and display advertising viewed by visitors on
other sites. Our ad network partner(s) may use cookies or similar technologies to collect information
about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your
interests and browsing patterns. Such activity is often called behavioral targeting or re-targeting,
and this may change the ads or other features you see on our website or other websites that you visit.
If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may
opt-out of specific re-targeting programs by <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/" target="_blank">clicking
here</a> or for the NAI opt-out site <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!/" target="_blank">here</a>.
These opt-out programs may not be designed to work for all advertising networks or methods. Your
browser may also have settings to reduce re-targeting, such as switching to (In)private or incognito
browsing mode or a mode that does not accept cookies. Currently, our site does not change its behavior
based on receiving your browser’s “do-not-track” setting or signal. Please note that opting out of
re-targeting does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads
instead of tailored ads.</p>
<p id="browser" class="section__subheader">Browsers and Internet Security</p>
<p class="section__body">Any time you enter or provide personal information and sensitive information (such
as credit card number and social security number) in our website, we encrypt it using Secure Socket
Layer (“SSL”) technology. SSL protects information as it crosses the Internet. To support this
technology, you need an SSL-capable browser. eHealthInsurance recommends using encryption at least as
strong as the 128-bit encryption available in browsers such as recent versions of Microsoft’s Internet
Explorer or Google’s Chrome browser. These browsers will activate SSL automatically whenever you begin
shopping for a plan on our website and when you return to our website to complete an application.</p>
<p class="section__body">In most browsers, you will see either a locked padlock or a key icon to indicate
your session connection is taking place via a secure server. This icon indicates you are visiting a
secure area within a website.</p>
<p class="section__body">If you need a strong encryption browser, you can go to the Microsoft website or
the Google website to download the latest Internet Explorer or Chrome browser. We do not recommend the
use of beta browser versions.</p>
<p class="section__body">No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is
100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions
about security on our Web site, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@ehealthinsurance.com">privacy@ehealthinsurance.com</a></p>
<p id="password" class="section__subheader">Your Password and Other Security Issues</p>
<p class="section__body">The password you enter when you begin an application on our website is your
private entry key into your application. You should never share it with anyone.</p>
<p class="section__body">If you forget your password, we can send your password through email (provided
that you gave us your email address as your user ID when you created an account on our website) or we
can help you retrieve your password by calling us toll free at 800-977-8860 or contacting us through
the chat function on our website.</p>
<p id="risk" class="section__subheader">Security Risk of Using Non-Approved Automated Software Applications</p>
<p class="section__body">For security reasons to guard the safety of your data, access to this website is
limited to SSL-capable browsers such as recent versions of Microsoft’s Internet Explorer or Google’s
Chrome. Under no circumstance should you use any software, program, application or any other device to
access or log-in to the eHealthInsurance website, or to automate the process of obtaining, downloading,
transferring or transmitting any content to or from our computer systems, website or proprietary
software.</p>
<p id="websites" class="section__subheader">Links to Other Websites</p>
<p class="section__body">Our website contains links to other websites. Please note that when you click on
one of these links you are “clicking” to another website. eHealthInsurance is not responsible for the
information privacy practices or the content of such websites. We encourage you to read the privacy
policies of these linked websites as their information privacy practices may differ from ours.</p>

aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who
access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact
us at <a href="mailto:testimonial@ehealth.com">testimonial@ehealth.com</a>. In some cases, we may not

so and why.</p>

<p class="section__body">We display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our site in addition to
other endorsements. With your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name. If you wish to

<p class="section__subheader">Social Media Features and Widgets</p>
<p class="section__body">Our website includes social media features, such as the Facebook Like button and
Widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These
features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to
enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third
