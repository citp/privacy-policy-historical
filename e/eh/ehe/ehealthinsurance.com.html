<p class="mainblueheader">eHealthInsurance's Privacy Policy</p>

<p>This eHealthInsurance Privacy Policy discloses the information privacy practices for the website you are currently visiting.</p>

<p>Throughout the policy, we refer to information that can identify you as a specific individual, such as your name, phone number, email address, Social Security number or credit card number as "personal information."  Further, personal information includes any information involving your health or medical history.</p>

<ol>

<li><b>We do not sell, trade or give away your personal information to anyone.</b><br><br></li>

<li><b>We do not disclose personal information to third parties, unless one of the following limited exceptions applies.</b><br><br>

	<ul>
	<li><b><i>Health Insurance Company.</i></b>  We disclose personal information directly to your chosen health insurance company to process your application.  Additionally, your personal information may be used by your chosen health insurance company to bill you if your application is approved.<br><br></li>
	<li><b><i>Service Providers.</i></b>  We may disclose personal information to other companies that help us process or service your health insurance application or correspond with you.  For example, we may provide your personal information to a service provider to verify the validity or credit limit of your credit card.  Please be assured that the companies we hire to process or service your health insurance application or correspond with you are not allowed to use your personal information for their own purposes and are contractually obligated to maintain strict confidentiality.<br><br></li>
	<li><b><i>Legal Obligations.</i></b>  We may disclose or report personal information when we believe, in good faith, that the disclosure is required or permitted under law, for example, to cooperate with regulators or law enforcement authorities or to resolve consumer disputes.<br><br></li>
	</ul>
	<b>Outside of these exceptions, we will not share your personal information with third parties.</b><br><br></li>
	
<li><b>We collect personal information in the normal course of business in order to process your health insurance application and to serve you better.</b><br><br>
    <ul>
	              <li><b>Creating an account.</b> We begin collecting personal 
                    information from you after you create your account by entering 
                    your email address and choosing your password. Under our current 
                    process, you must create an account before (i) starting an 
                    application for an individual or family plan or for a Medicare 
                    Supplement plan, or (ii) obtaining a quote for a small business 
                    plan. <br>
                    <br></li>
	              <li><b>Providing you with a quote or processing your application.</b> 
                    We may use your personal information to get in touch with 
                    you when necessary to process your application or to provide 
                    you with a quote. For example, emails will be sent to you 
                    throughout the application process to inform you of the status 
                    of your application and to seek additional information that 
                    is requested as part of the application.<br>
                    <br></li>
	              <li><b>Customer satisfaction and other products.</b>

<p><a name="cookies" class="bluebold">“Cookies”</a></p>

<p>“Cookies” are small files that are stored by your web browser to help a particular
system recognize you and the pages you visited in a website.  Our website uses cookies to
make your online experience more convenient.  For example, we may use a cookie to store your
account information between sessions and to maintain information about the quotes you've
requested during your session.  Additionally, we may use data from cookies for a variety
of internal purposes, such as studying how users navigate our website.  We do not collect
any personal information from cookies.  Further, no other information we collect from cookies
can be linked back to your personal information.  Most browsers automatically accept cookies,
but if you prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies.  Even without a cookie, you can still
use most of the features on our website, including obtaining quotes and applying for an
insurance policy.</p>


<p><a name="browsers" class="bluebold">Browsers and Internet Security</a></p>

<p>Any time you enter or provide personal information in our website, we encrypt it
using Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") technology.  SSL protects information as it crosses
the Internet.  To support this technology, you need an SSL-capable browser.
eHealthInsurance recommends using a strong encryption, 128-bit browser such as Microsoft's
Internet Explorer 4.01 or higher or Netscape Navigator 4.06 or higher.  These browsers will
activate SSL automatically whenever you begin shopping for a health plan on our website
and when you return to our website to complete an application.</p>

<p>You can tell if you are visiting a secure area within a website by looking at
the symbol on the bottom of your browser screen.  If you are using Internet Explorer
or Netscape Navigator, you will see either a lock or a key.  When the padlock is in
the locked position, your session connection is taking place via a secure server.</p>

<p>If you need a strong encryption browser, you can go to the Microsoft website
or the Netscape website to download the latest Internet Explorer or Navigator browser.
We do not recommend the use of beta browser versions. </p>


<p><a name="password" class="bluebold">Your Password and Other Security Issues</a></p>


<p>The password you enter when you begin an application on our website is your
private entry key into your application.  You should never share it with anyone.</p>

<p>Your password must be between 6-20 digits and/or letters long.</p>

<p>If you forget your password, we can send your password through
email (provided that you gave us your email address as your user ID when you created
an account on our website) or we can help you retrieve your password by calling us toll
free at 800-977-8860.</p>

<p><a name="risk" class="bluebold">Security Risk of Using Non-Approved Automated Software Applications</a></p>

<p>For security reasons to guard the safety of your data, access to this website is limited to
SSL-capable browsers such as Microsoft's Internet Explorer 4.01 or higher or Netscape Navigator 4.06
or higher.  Under no circumstance should you use any software, program, application or any
other device to access or log-in to the eHealthInsurance website, or to automate the process
of obtaining, downloading, transferring or transmitting any content to or from our computer
systems, website or proprietary software.</p>

<p><a name="websites" class="bluebold">Links to Other Websites</a></p>

            <p>Our website contains links to other websites. Please note that 
              when you click on one of these links you are "clicking" to another 
              website. eHealthInsurance is not responsible for the information 
              privacy practices or the content of such websites. We encourage 
              you to read the privacy policies of these linked websites as their 
              information privacy practices may differ from ours.<br>
