# Privacy Policy | Environmental Working Group

Updated July 13, 2006

The Environmental Working Group (EWG) will automatically add you to our database of supporters when you participate in any EWG or EWG Action Fund campaign. If you do not wish to be on our list, you may unsubscribe at any time, and we will make that option easily and readily available. **EWG will never sell or trade your e-mail address or other contact information.**

### Information Collected

**LOG FILES**

Like most websites, EWG servers may record the numerical Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using; the browser software you use and your operating system; the time and date you access our site; and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our site. EWG uses this information to measure the number of visitors to different sections of the site, to diagnose and correct system errors, and to improve the site. No information that identifies you personally is collected in our server logs.

**USE OF COOKIES**

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Cookies must be turned on to use certain interactive content on the EWG website. We use cookies to store basic information and preferences so we can customize the user experience. No information that identifies you personally is stored in a cookie. To learn more about cookies, visit <http://www.getnetwise.org/glossary.php#cookie>.

**SUBSCRIBER INFORMATION AND "CONTACT US" FORMS**

Information submitted by users via the "Contact Us" page listed next to mailing address at the bottom of our website comes to EWG in the form of an email. EWG will store your email address in our newsletter subscriber database if: (1) you elect to receive our email newsletter when you use our web-based form to contact us, or (2) if you participate in any EWG Action. EWG does not collect any information other than that provided on the subscription form.

### Information Use

**NEWSLETTER**

Subscriber information will be used by EWG to send out messages related to the EWG newsletter. 

**SHARING SUBSCRIBER INFORMATION**

EWG reserves the right to share subscriber information with EWG's sister organization, EWG Action Fund. Otherwise, EWG will not share personally identifiable subscriber information with a third party except in the unlikely event that it is required by law or if we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our website. EWG does not have plans to share aggregate information with any third party, but reserves the right to do so. Should this happen, an appropriate amendment will be made to this privacy policy.

**COMMUNICATIONS FROM WEBSITE**

EWG sends new subscribers a welcome email to explain what you can expect to receive from us, and to describe the process to unsubscribe. Approximately once a month, EWG will send subscribers an email with information and links to our website and other related content. EWG may also send subscribers information about EWG events and fundraising efforts. Occasionally, we may create a special issue should events warrant. In that case, subscribers would receive an extra message with notice of the special issue.

EWG will use the subscriber list to send administrative announcements pertaining to the newsletter and subscriptions, or changes to this privacy policy. EWG may also, on rare occasion, send out inquiries to subscribers requesting feedback about the newsletter. EWG does not currently offer a way to opt out of administrative announcements and other messages.

**SUBSCRIPTION TERMINATION**

Subscribers may unsubscribe from our email newsletter at any time. Instructions to unsubscribe are included at the bottom of every EWG newsletter. If you are unable to complete your request using our automated system, please contact us at (202) 667-6982. Requests are usually processed within several working days.

**LINKS**

This website may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that EWG is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this website.

**SECURITY**

Because we collect only very basic contact information, we do not currently use encryption software to protect this data. We gather subscription information via our website and store it in a private, online database to which only EWG has access. Subscriber information is not stored on line.

**UPDATING CONTACT INFORMATION**

If a subscriber's email address changes, use our automated system to unsubscribe your old email address, and then re-subscribe using the new one. If you experience problems, please call us at (202) 667-6982.

**CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post these changes to this privacy statement, the homepage and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

If we are going to use subscribers' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify subscribers via email. Subscribers will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner.
