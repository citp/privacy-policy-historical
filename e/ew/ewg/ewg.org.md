# Privacy Policy | Environmental Working Group

**EWG’S PRIVACY POLICY**  
_Updated September 2011_

The Environmental Working Group will automatically add you to our database of supporters when you participate in any EWG or EWG Action Fund campaign. If you do not wish to be on EWG’s list, you may unsubscribe at any time, and we will make that option easily and readily available. **EWG will never sell your e-mail address or other contact information.**

### **Information Collected**

**LOG FILES**

Like most websites, EWG servers may record the numerical Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using; the browser software you use and your operating system; the time and date you access EWG’s website; and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our site. EWG uses this information to measure the number of visitors to various sections of the site, to diagnose and correct system errors, and to improve the site. No information that identifies you personally is collected in our server logs.

**USE OF COOKIES**

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user. Cookies must be turned on to use certain interactive content on EWG’s website. We use cookies to store basic information and preferences so we can customize the user experience. No information that identifies you personally is stored in a cookie. To learn more about cookies, visit _<http://www.getnetwise.org/glossary.php#cookie>_.

**SUBSCRIBER INFORMATION AND “CONTACT US” FORMS**

Information submitted by users via the “Contact Us” page listed next to the mailing address at the bottom of our website comes to EWG in the form of an email. EWG will store your email address in its database of supporters if: (1) you elect to receive our email updates when you use our web-based form to contact us, or (2) if you participate in any EWG or EWG Action Fund campaign. EWG does not collect any information other than what the supporter provides on our forms. If you would like to review your personal information collected, make corrections and/or request that your information not be shared with third parties, please contact us at (202) 667-6982. Requests are usually processed within several working days.

### **Information Use**

**E-MAIL COMMUNICATIONS**

Subscriber information will be used by EWG to send out messages related to our work, advocacy and related messaging. 

**SHARING SUBSCRIBER INFORMATION**

EWG reserves the right to share subscriber information with EWG's sister organization, EWG Action Fund, as well as its agents. Otherwise, EWG will not share personally identifiable information with a third party, except in the unlikely event that it is required by law or if we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a court order or legal process served on our website.

**COMMUNICATIONS FROM WEBSITE**

EWG sends new supporters a welcome email to explain what you can expect to receive from us. EWG also sends supporters periodic emails with information and links to our website and other related content. EWG also sends supporters information about EWG events, action campaigns and fundraising efforts. 

**SUBSCRIPTION TERMINATION**

Supporters may unsubscribe from our email updates at any time. Links to unsubscribe are included at the bottom of every EWG e-mail communication. If you are unable to complete your request using our automated system, please contact us at (202) 667-6982. Requests are usually processed within several working days.

**LINKS**

EWG’s website may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that EWG is not responsible for the privacy practices of those other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by EWG’s website.

**SECURITY**

Because EWG collects only very basic contact information, we currently do not use encryption software to protect this data. We gather information about our supporters via our website and store it in a private, online database to which only EWG, its sister organization EWG Action Fund, and their agents have access. 

**CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY**

If EWG decides to change its privacy policy, we will post these changes to this statement, to the [www.ewg.org](http://www.ewg.org/) homepage and to any other places we deem appropriate to ensure that our users will always know what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances, if any, we share it.  
If we wish to use supporters’ personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify supporters via email. Supporters will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner.
