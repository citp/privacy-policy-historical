      </p>
      <font face="Arial" style="font-size: 9pt">
      <p>This web site is owned and operated by Eternal Word Television Network, 
      Inc. (EWTN). We recognize that visitors to our site may be concerned about 
      the information they provide to us, and how we treat that information. 
      This Privacy Policy addresses those concerns and our commitment to 
      protecting your privacy on this web site. The information we collect from 
      you is used to improve the content of our web site and to provide you with 
      information, products or other services available to you through EWTN. 
      This Privacy Policy may be changed or updated from time to time and we 
      recommend that you review these terms periodically. </p>
      <p><b>Our Policy</b></p>
      <p>EWTN respects and protects the privacy of our online visitors and 
      donors. EWTN does not disclose, give, sell or transfer to third parties 
      any personal information about our visitors without their permission, 
      unless required by law. </p>
      <p>Throughout its history, EWTN has never shared its donor mailing lists 
      or personal information with third parties. It remains EWTN's policy that 
      mailing lists, both postal and electronic, are never sold or exchanged 
      with third parties. </p>
      <p><b>Credit Card and Other Personal Information</b></p>
      <p>EWTN uses industry standard efforts such as firewalls and Secure Socket 
      Layers (SSL) to safeguard the confidentiality of your personally 
      identifiable information. We make every reasonable effort to prevent the 
      loss, misuse or theft of the information under our control.</p>
      <p>We care about the safety and security of online transactions. We use 
      the industry standard high grade encryption and security protocol to 
      communicate with your browser software. This method makes it extremely 
      difficult for anyone else to intercept the credit card information you 
      send to us. Third parties with which we work process credit card 
      transactions using high grade encryption and security protocols. </p>
      <p><b>Our Commitment to Accuracy</b></p>
      <p>In addition to maintaining privacy and security controls for 
      information you share with us, EWTN uses error checking procedures to 
      accurately and completely process your transaction information. Our staff 
      is available Monday through Friday from 9am to 6pm (US Eastern Time) to 
      answer questions by phone at 1-205-271-2989 or by email at
      <a href="mailto:viewer@ewtn.com">viewer@ewtn.com</a>. </p>
      <p>Changes are made to our error checking procedures as necessary to 
      improve our system and independent external audits are periodically 
      conducted to ensure the appropriate processing of your information from 
      our web site. </p>
      <p><b>Use of "Cookies"</b></p>
      <p>Visitors to the EWTN web site should be aware that non-personal 
      information and data is automatically collected by the EWTN web site 
      through the use of "cookies." "Cookies" are small text files which a web 
      site can use to recognize repeat visitors, facilitate a visitor's ongoing 
      access to, and use of, the site, and allow a web site to track usage 
      behavior and compile data that will allow content improvements. Cookies 
      are not programs that come onto a visitor's system and damage files. 
      Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique identifier to the visitor 
      that has no meaning outside the assigning web site. If a visitor does not 
      want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple 
      procedure in most browsers that allows the visitor to deny or accept the 
      cookie feature. EWTN uses "cookie" technology only to obtain non-personal 
      information from its online visitors in order to improve visitors' online 
      experience and facilitate their visit of EWTN's web site. </p>
      <p><b>Links</b></p>
      <p>This web site may contain links to other web sites. Please be aware 
      that EWTN is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other web 
      sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our web site and to 
      read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects 
      personally identifiable information from you. This privacy statement 
      applies solely to information collected by the EWTN web site. </p>
      <p><b>Message Boards and Public Forums</b></p>
      <p>Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal 
      information on our web site (for example, on message boards such as the 
      Catholic Q&amp;A and Bulletin Board or through email) that information may be 
      collected and used by others. By posting personal information on our web 
      site that is publicly accessible by others, you may receive unsolicited 
      messages from other parties in return.</p>
      <p><b>Note to Parents on Our Privacy Policy</b></p>
      <p>EWTN encourages children to learn more about the Catholic Faith through 
      the use of our web site and in particular through our EWTNKids web site. 
      However, we ask that this be done only with their parent's knowledge and 
      supervision. For this reason, EWTN has established a separate
      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ewtn.com/ewtnkids/privacy_policy.asp">
      EWTNKids Children's Privacy Policy</a> which adheres to the Children's 
      Online Privacy Protection Act, enacted by the U.S. Congress, and its rules 
      on collecting personal information from minors.</p>
      <p><b>Opt-out</b></p>
      <p>If you no longer wish to receive electronic mailings from us, you may 
      opt-out of receiving these communications by following the "unsubscribe" 
      information contained at the bottom of the message or by contacting us as 
      indicated below.</p>
      <p><b>Contact our Web Site </b></p>
      <p>Thank you for visiting our web site. We are available to answer your
