**Security**

eWatches.com takes your security seriously and takes reasonable steps to protect your information. No data transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. The following is a summary of the measures eWatches.com takes to protect your information and descriptions of ways we implement these measures for different types of information you may provide to us. 

eWatches.com continues to evaluate and implement enhancements in security technology and practices, however we can only take steps to help reduce the risks of unauthorized access. Each individual using the Internet can take steps to help protect their information and further minimize the likelihood that a security incident may occur. 

**Security Steps We Have Taken**

  * **Secure Socket Layer (SSL)**  
eWatches.com uses SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption when transmitting certain kinds of information, such as financial services information or payment information. An icon resembling a padlock is displayed on the bottom of most browsers window during SSL transactions that involve credit cards and other forms of payment. In addition, "https" replaces "http" in the browser address bar when you are in our secure area.  The "s" in https means you are in a secure part of our site.  Any time eWatches.com asks you for a credit card number on eWatches.com for payment or for verification purposes, it will be SSL encrypted. The information you provide will be stored securely on our servers. Once you choose to store or enter your credit card number on eWatches.com, it will not be displayed back to you in its entirety when you retrieve or edit it in the future. Instead of the entire number, you will only see asterisks and either the first four digits or the last four digits of your number.  We use an SSL certficate obtained through InstantSSL/Comodo.  [Click here](http://www.instantssl.com/ssl-certificate-corporate/ssl-certificate-index.html) for more information about the company that supplied our SSL certficate.

  * **Employee and Contractor Access to Information**  
eWatches.com limits access to personal information about you to those employees who we reasonably believe need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect personal information about you. 

  * **Education and Training for Employees**  
eWatches.com has implemented a company-wide education and training program about security that is required of every eWatches.com employee.
