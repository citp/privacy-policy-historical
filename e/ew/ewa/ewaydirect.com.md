**Security**

eWayDirect.com is committed to protecting the privacy of our members and the security of their subscriber databases/lists. You can rest assured that our eWayDirect.com system is secure. Other eWayDirect members never have access to your e-lists or private data. At eWayDirect.com, we know that customer privacy is a huge concern to any company that does business over the Internet. 

Therefore, we provide a secure community where you market to your own customers, and, with the permission of other members, can market to their subscribers/customers, too. All content and newsletter sharing is completely at your discretion. You hold the key, and no one will ever have access to your database except you through your password-protected co-branded Web site. 

eWayDirect.com maintains the confidentiality, security and integrity of personal information that we obtain from, and for, our members. We do not disclose personal information to any party beyond the network, unless required by law or by a government agency, or in an emergency situation. 

The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our members is of utmost concern to us. Only those employees who need access to our members' information in order to do their jobs are allowed access. Any employee who violates our privacy and/or security policies is subject to disciplinary action, including possible termination and civil and/or criminal prosecution.
