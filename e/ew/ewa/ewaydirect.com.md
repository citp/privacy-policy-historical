People clicking on this link will be opted-out of future mailings in real time.

In addition, upon request, and after receiving proof of identity, we provide people with access to any and all information that we maintain about them individually.

All requests will be honored within 5 days of the user notification and proof of identity.

Client Email Campaigns

eWayDirect delivers permission-based electronic marketing campaigns on behalf of our clients. Campaigns are sent only to people who have agreed to receive these emails. In doing so:

  2. We track a recipient's ability to support HTML email, as well as whether an HTML email message has been opened or previewed. This capability is used to deliver relevant content to the recipient.
  3. We collect information regarding the activity of email recipients, which is only reported to the client who owns the list.
  4. If eWayDirect determines a client has knowingly used our system for sending unsolicited email, we may revoke the right of this client to use our system.
