How Is Your Information Protected? 

_We are committed to ensuring that all of your EclaimsLine.com transactions are safe and secure and protected by VeriSign._. 

To ensure that every transaction is protected, we use advanced encryption technology; we treat your credit card and personal information with the highest standards of confidentiality and safety. To that end all such information about you, which is maintained on our server, is protected by the use of technologically advanced firewalls. We restrict access to your personal information to only the employees or agents of VISA, the underwriter, benefit administrator and the program quality assurance monitor, who need to know that information in order to service your account. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information. 

By filing your claim on our secure server, you are further protected by Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, utilized by most popular browsers, including Netscape and Microsoft Explorer.
