The current version of this Privacy Policy will be posted on the ECW PRESS website at all times. Please check back frequently to see any updates or changes to this Agreement. Your continued use of the ECW PRESS website following the posting of any changes means you agree to be bound by such changes.

  * better understand your preferences and provide you with newsletters and other tailored offers if you opt in to receive them

We may also: (i) respond to your inquiries and provide you with information and communicate with you about products, listings, events, and services you request; and (ii) communicate relevant offers and targeted listings to you if you opt in to receive them.

By consenting to our collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information through your use of the ECW PRESS website (including any products and services available on the ECW PRESS website), you will allow us to fulfill the purposes for which we collect your Personal Information, as described above or communicated to you at the time of information collection.

#### **COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

ECW PRESS regards the privacy of all users as of utmost importance. We will take all **commercially reasonable** means necessary to protect any information you may give us. We only collect Personal Information that you provide or that is otherwise provided to us on your behalf (such as your name, address, phone number, email address, etc.). By providing your Personal Information to us, you implicitly agree that we may collect, use, and disclose your Personal Information as outlined in this Privacy Policy. Unless we advise otherwise, your information will only be used for the purposes for which it was provided or to contact you. We will limit the information we collect to what we need for those purposes.

####  **DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**  

We do not disclose your Personal Information to third parties without your consent unless required or permitted by applicable law. We will not rent, sell, loan, or otherwise market your Personal Information to any third party. There are some situations in which we may disclose your Personal Information without your consent. For example:

  * when we are required or authorized by law to do so, for example if a court issues a subpoena

  * when the services we are providing to you require us to give your information to a third party your consent will be implied, unless you tell us otherwise

  * when we believe we need to disclose information to protect our rights, or the rights of others, property, or to enforce this Privacy Policy or the terms and conditions of the ECW PRESS website, including where it is necessary to establish or collect amounts owed to us

  * if the information is public record information specified by regulation and the disclosure is directly related to the purposes for which it was recorded on the public record




We may transfer your personal information to service providers who are performing services on our behalf. These service providers will be obligated to treat your personal information in accordance with the requirements of this Privacy Policy.

Occasionally, we may use service providers located outside of Canada to process and/or store Personal Information for us. Please note that Personal Information in the custody of these service providers may be subject to access by the law enforcement authorities of those jurisdictions in which the service providers are located. Our Privacy Officer, whose contact information is provided below, can provide further information about our policies and practices regarding service providers located outside of Canada and further information about how these service providers collect, use, disclose, or store personal information on our behalf.

In the event that our company undergoes a fundamental change such as a sale of assets, or a merger with another company or enterprise, it may be necessary for us to disclose your Personal Information to the prospective counterparties to the transaction and their professional advisors. No such disclosure will occur unless these entities have executed confidentiality agreements in respect of your Personal Information and limit their use of it to the purposes necessary for completing the transaction and the operation of the business after the transaction is complete.

####  **CONSENT**  

When you provide us with your Personal Information, you agree that you are providing us your implied consent to collect and use your Personal Information to fulfill the requested order, service, or information. You may withdraw your consent to our collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information at any time. However, please note that, for certain services, if you withdraw your consent, we may no longer be able to provide the service to you.

Additionally, if you opt in to receive promotional emails, every email will contain an “unsubscribe” link that you can click to withdraw your consent and remove your email address from further promotional messages.

#### **ACCURACY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

It is important that the information you provide us is accurate and updated. You have a right to challenge the accuracy and completeness of your Personal Information and to have it amended, as appropriate. You also have a right to request access to your Personal Information and receive an accounting of how that information has been used and disclosed, subject to certain exceptions prescribed by law. For example, if the requested information would reveal Personal Information about another individual, your access may be limited or denied. If your request for access is denied, we will notify you in writing and explain why.

You may contact our Privacy Officer to ask us to remove your Personal Information from our records, electronic or otherwise.
