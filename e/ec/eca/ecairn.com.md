consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States, which may not offer an equivalent

##  **European Union / GDPR**

As part of the GDPR requirements, please find below  our detailed activity & processes on personal data , and the rights you can claim about your personal data.

Here is the EU definition of personal data: [https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/)

##  **Data processed by eCairn?**

eCairn processes  four differents types of personal data :

  1. Employees and subcontractor data. 
  2. Clients and prospects data
  3. Personal data from users of personal data from users eCairn Conversation ™ app and eCairn Social Selling applications.
  4. Influencers and “who’s who”/affluent profiles. Data purchased from data providers and indexed from Internet using our proprietary software



The latter (#4) is clearly the area where eCairn has the most volume of personal data  i.e we collect and index the data from influencers and “who’s who”.

The personal data we index as part of #4 are **public** data that we obtain directly or indirectly from social media networks.

eCairn is only indexing data which is voluntarily posted on the Internet with a **public** status and which has been prone to expressed consent regarding the use by third parties.

This includes:

  * ids, location, name, job title, company, profile picture as made public by the owner of the social profiles.
  * Content you published using that name, ids (posts, comments, likes).



eCairn never collects information which has a private status and is not able to access profiles or pages online and social networks, if the access has been restricted by the user.

##  **How eCairn uses data?**

###  Employees, Clients, Partners, Suppliers and Users:

(#1), (#2), (#3)

eCairn uses data on Employees, clients, suppliers, partners and users to conduct normal business functions such as communication, support, payment, invoicing, sales.

We also monitor and collect data about the use of our service by our users in order to improve them.

We also collect information relative to the devices that you use to visit our website or use our application

### Influencers  & Web Users (who’s who and affluent people)(#4)

For influencers and affluent people, eCairn uses the data for market research and to 

  * **identify** “key people” our clients should talk to/engage with/follow and help our clients with the most relevant engagement.


  *  **Infer information such as gender, age, center of interest, profession, influence on key topics.**



Typical use case: a B2B Tech client wants to identify most influential people in cloud computing in the UK.  Analyzing public data on the internet- data that people explicitly post to reach a large audience – , eCairn builds a list of the best people for our client to talk to along with trending topics of the day/week.

##  **How is this web public data indexed?**

As part of its collection activity, eCairn uses automated indexing systems, also known as “crawlers”. Our crawlers are identifiable and site owners can opt to block them or contact us with more information.

They can do so by contacting us directly or by filing an abuse report with AWS.   eCairn maintains a list of website who have explicitly opted for not been crawled and we stop crawling web sites and remove the data within 48 hours after notification,

eCairn also purchases data from Social networks (Twitter).
