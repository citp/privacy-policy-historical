We don’t care. We make no efforts to safeguard the privacy of the information you provide us, period.

When you log in to post comments, we will ask for your name, email address and optionally your Website location. We ask for your email address so that we can verify your email address, so other people cannot register for you. We do this to protect you and your email account.

If you purchase services from us, we will ask for the minimum information necessary to verify that you are authorized to make the purchase, that you are who you say, and not someone else with your credit card. We will ask for your address, your credit card information, including the expiration date to make sure that the card owner is the one who is using it. If you notice any charges from our site that you did not authorize, please contact your bank first, and then contact us so we can resolve any issues.

We may, from time to time, have site polls or surveys in which we will ask for certain demographic information, along with your opinions of our site. Any information we request for these polls is strictly for internal purposes, to help us understand our readers. We may share cumulative data with our partners (average age of our users, etc.), but we will never share with our partners your name, your personal information, or your contact information. This demographic data will be entirely anonymous, and only for statistical purposes. If you receive any email correspondence claiming to be from eCommerce Optimization that includes requests for your personal information or that asks you to log into any URL that does NOT begin with eCommerceoptimization.com, please report it to us immediately.
