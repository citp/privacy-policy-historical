# Privacy Policy | Ecolint | International School of Geneva

## Use of Personal Data

We collect and process personal data which you voluntarily provide by sending us an email, applying for a job, accepting an offer of employment, participating in a survey, completing an online form, or enrolling yourself or your children in our school or one of our related services such as holiday camps, our Centre des arts, our alumni membership platform or a further education training course.

We create and process personal data files about our current and future students, clients and alumni in order to evaluate and deal with their registration and admission as well as to manage any subsequent contractual relationship with the concerned data subject or their legal representative(s).

We do the same regarding job applicants and our current employees for the purposes of the recruiting process and if applicable the management of the subsequent employment relationship.

We also collect personal data which are freely accessible in the public domain about potential fundraising prospects or donors in order to secure the legitimate interests of financial support for the Foundation.

Personal data relating to tuition fee payments or fundraising activities is exclusively used for internal, statistical or fundraising purposes.

All personal data collection and analysis is done in compliance with both the applicable Swiss and European data protection laws and the corresponding data are treated confidentially.

We will only share personal data with affiliates for the purposes of conducting the activities and business of the school and provision of related services. The personal data collected will not be disclosed to third parties without the prior consent of the data subject or their legal representative(s).

## Consent to Personal Data Processing

By providing data to the International School of Geneva (hereinafter “Ecolint”), you confirm that pursuant to the provision of Article 4 (11) of the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation UE 2016/679) in force as of May 25, 2018, Ecolint, with its registered seat at 62 Route de Chêne, 1208, Geneva, Switzerland, as a data controller, may process and subsequently use or further communicate your personal data for the purposes of conducting its educational business and activities and for sending communications related to the school and its associated services. This consent is also considered as the consent to send electronic mail messages and SMS messages under the GDPR provisions. At the same time you agree that the controller may also process your personal data through a data processor under the terms and conditions set out by the GDPR. We have contracts in place with our data processors. This means that they cannot do anything with your personal data unless we have instructed them to do it. They will not share your personal data with any organization apart from us. They will hold it securely and retain it for the period we instruct.

The consent is provided for an unlimited period until it is revoked.

In some circumstances we are legally obliged to share information. For example under a court order or where we cooperate with other European or Swiss supervisory authorities in handling complaints or investigations. We might also share information with other regulatory bodies in order to comply with their, or our, objectives. In any scenario, we will satisfy ourselves that we have a lawful basis on which to share the information and document our decision making and satisfy ourselves we have a legal basis on which to share the information.

## Your data protection rights

You have the right to ask us for copies of your personal data. It is important that the personal data we hold about you are accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal information changes. Thus the personal data may be modified or supplemented, and the consent to processing thereof may be revoked or restricted at any time by sending an email to [privacy@ecolint.ch](mailto:privacy@ecolint.ch). No charge will be made. In such a case, the provided personal data will be updated, blocked, or deleted immediately. Receiving electronic mails or messages from Ecolint may be revoked in the same manner at any time. We will not keep personal data longer than is necessary for the purpose or purposes for which they were collected

You further acknowledge that in order for Ecolint to provide certain services, notably education for your children, some personal information may be required, and that if you choose to revoke consent for the storage and processing of those data, this may entail the cancellation of your contract.
