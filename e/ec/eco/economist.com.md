**Economist.com Website Privacy Statement**

The Economist.com, part of the Economist Newspaper Limited, is committed to protecting the privacy of its users. This statement outlines our privacy and data protection policy. 

**Collection and Use of User Details**  
Personal details of users of Economist.com will be collected and processed upon registration to our website.

All personal information is collected with the knowledge of Economist.com customers via the Website's order and registration forms only.

This information is collected for the following purposes:

User information is retained for in-house research to: 

  * improve our understanding of customer needs and product development

  * build marketing profiles

  * aid strategic development

  * manage our relationship with advertisers


All results of such research and analysis will be anonymised or aggregated information and will not reveal any personal facts about individual customers. 

Economist.com is part of The Economist Group which operates from offices worldwide. Steps have been taken to ensure that consistently high standards of data protection are adhered to in all regional offices for all the forms of processing mentioned above. 

**User Choices**  
All registration and order forms provide users with a series of choices as regards further promotional activity, forms of communication and third party processing. 

When filling out order or registration forms on Economist.com, users should indicate whether they are receptive to the use of e-mail to inform them of further Economist Group promotional literature. If you are keen to be kept informed of further Economist.com products as well as technical/functional developments related to our website and on-line services then you should untick the e-mail opt-in box. 

You may also indicate whether you wish to receive such information from other Economist Group businesses. If you don't wish to hear from these companies, please untick the appropriate box on the registration form to opt out of such activity. 

We will occasionally allow other similar but reputable organisations to contact you. If you don't wish to hear from these companies, please untick the appropriate box on the registration form to opt out of such activity. 

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a small file which is placed on the user's hard drive following an Economist.com visit. This file subsequently allows the user to move quickly and easily around our site by keeping a record of your previous visit(s). It is used to identify first time users from previous visits and is only used for ID purposes and tracks a user's sessions. A subscriber will have the cookie linked to their e-mail address as a way of identifying them. We do not link this information to users' personal details. 

Cookies can be deleted from a PC's hard drive at any time by the user. Further information on the use of cookies can be found on [http://cookiecentral.com](http://cookiecentral.com/)

**Security Policy**  
Economist.com will maintain appropriate measures to ensure that users' personal details are not misused, accidentally destroyed, lost or altered within the Economist Group server environment. 

Occasions will arise when customer information is passed outside the Economist Group to other data processors (i.e. fulfilment bureaux, database consultants etc.) but they will only act upon instruction from the Economist Group in order to perform the services required. 

**Transfer of Personal Data Overseas**  
Given that the Internet is a global environment, using the Internet to collect and process personal data necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis. Therefore, by browsing Economist.com and communicating electronically with us you acknowledge and agree to our processing of personal data in this way. 

**Updating Customer Details**  
It is important to us that we have your correct contact information so that you don't miss out on further correspondence or experience problems with the delivery of products. [Click here](https://web.archive.org/members/myaccount.cfm?CFID=1702548&CFTOKEN=51906687) to view or edit your Economist.com account details. 

**Children Under 13**  
The Economist Group do not intentionally collect any personally identifiable information from individuals under the age of 13. When necessary underage users will be told not to submit any personal details and we will make every effort to delete any details of such users where a parent of guardian has informed us that these details have been collected.
