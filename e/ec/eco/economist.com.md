**Economist.com Website Privacy policy**

Economist.com, part of The Economist Newspaper Limited, is committed to protecting the privacy of its users. The following outlines our privacy and data protection policy. 

Third party partners of Economist.com and other websites you may access via Economist.com have different privacy policies and are not subject to this privacy policy. We recommend that you read the privacy statement of each such website to find out how they protect your personal information. 

**Collection and Use of User Details**   
When you register at Economist.com, we collect personal details about you. 

Personal information such as your name, address, e-mail address and job title is collected via Economist.com’s order and registration forms. 

When you visit the site, we also collect web site usage information and information about your computer and internet connection, including your computer's IP address, the type and version of browser and operating system you use, your internet domain and, if you arrived at Economist.com via a link from another website, the URL of the linking page. 

We use this information to: 

  * fulfil orders
  * personalise the content and advertising you will see based on your personal characteristics or preferences
  * notify you of relevant new products and features on Economist.com (if you opt in to receiving such information)
  * notify you of promotions from Economist.com and from the Economist Group of companies (if you opt in to receiving such information)
  * allow reputable third parties to send you information (again, if you opt in to receiving such information)
  * ensure, as far as is practical, that our site is compatible with the browsers and operating systems used by most of our visitors.

We also use the information for in-house research to:   


  * improve our understanding of customer needs in developing Economist.com
  * build marketing profiles
  * aid strategic development
  * manage our relationship with advertisers

The results of all such research and analysis will be presented as anonymous or aggregated information and will not reveal any personal facts about individual customers. 

Economist.com is part of The Economist Group, which operates from offices worldwide. Steps have been taken to ensure that high standards of data protection are adhered to in all regional offices for all the forms of processing mentioned above. 

**User Choices**  
The registration form provides you with a series of choices regarding promotional activity and other communication with you.

If you want to be kept informed of Economist.com products and offers, as well as technical or functional developments related to our website and on-line services, then you should tick the relevant opt-in box. 

You may also indicate whether you wish to receive such information from other Economist Group businesses. 

If you wish, we will occasionally allow other similar, reputable organisations to contact you. If you wish to hear from these companies, please tick the appropriate box on the registration form.

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a small file which is placed on the user's hard drive during an Economist.com visit. This file allows the user to move quickly and easily around our site. It is used to identify returning users and to identify subscribers and registrants (a registrant - and subscriber - will have the cookie linked to their e-mail address as a way of identifying them). This means that if you are a registrant or subscriber, you will not have to login each time you visit. We also use a cookie to track a user's sessions. We use this information to find out what site features are most popular so that we can develop Economist.com in the light of our analysis of people’s usage. We also use cookies and the information we collect to show you relevant content and advertising. 

You can delete cookies from your hard drive at any time. Bear in mind, though, that if you delete these cookies, any settings such as your stored username and password will have to be reset when you log in again. 

Unlike many sites, you will be able to use Economist.com even if you set your browser not to accept any cookies. However, certain features and content may not be available to you and you will have to log in every time you visit. 

Further information on the use of cookies can be found at: 

[http://www.cookiecentral.com](http://www.cookiecentral.com/). 

**E-mails**   
Economist.com uses reputable third parties to deliver the e-mails you will receive from our site if you subscribe to our e-mail newsletters or have chosen to receive information about Economist.com products and offers. These third parties use unique identifiers and invisible images (often called "pixel tags" or "clear GIFs") to perform message open sensing, message format sensing, and clickthrough sensing on behalf of Economist.com in order to bring you more relevant information. 

To find out more about these technologies as used in the e-mails sent on behalf of Economst.com by DoubleClick Inc., please click [here](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/privacy/email/default.asp). Content and some ad services in these e-mails are provided by Economist.com or another third party ad server.

**Adverts**   
Economist.com uses DoubleClick to deliver the advertisements that are placed within the site. DoubleClick may note some of the pages you visit on our site through the use of pixel tags (also called "clear gifs"). In the course of serving advertisements to this site, DoubleClick may place or recognise a unique "cookie" on your computer on behalf of Economist.com in order to bring to you more relevant information and in order to make sure that you do not receive the same advert many times in the same session. Some of the advertisers on Economist.com do not use DoubleClick advert-serving software and their adverts are served by third-parties who may place cookies. To find out more about these sensing methods and to know your choices about not having this information used by DoubleClick, please click [here](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/).

****

**Security Policy**  
Economist.com has appropriate measures in place to ensure that users' personal details are not misused, accidentally destroyed, lost or altered within the Economist Group server environment.

Occasions will arise when customer information is passed outside the Economist Group to other data processors (i.e. fulfillment bureaus, database consultants etc.) but they will only act upon instruction from the Economist Group in order to perform the services required.

**Transfer of Personal Data Overseas**  
Given that the Internet is a global environment, using the Internet to collect and process personal data necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis. Therefore, by browsing Economist.com and communicating electronically with us, you acknowledge and agree to our processing of personal data in this way. 

**Updating Customer Details**  
It is important to us that we have your correct contact information so that you don't miss out on further correspondence or experience problems with the delivery of products. 

**Children Under 13**  
The Economist Group does not intentionally collect any personally identifiable information from individuals under the age of 13. When necessary, underage users will be told not to submit any personal details and we will make every effort to delete any details of such users where a parent or guardian has informed us that these details have been collected. 

**Changes to this statement**  
Due to changes in legislation and best practice or enhancements to functionality and content on Economist.com we may make changes to our privacy policy and will reflect those changes in this statement, so you should check here from time to time.
