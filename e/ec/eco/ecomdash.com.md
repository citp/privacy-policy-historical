**Bidding and Buying Process.  **As part of the buying and selling process, ecomdash will facilitate the sharing of information between Buyers (as defined below) and ecomdash Clients. If you are making a sale as an ecomdash Client or a purchase on the Site as a Buyer, you are directing us to share your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you are a buyer involved in a transaction with an ecomdash Client (for example, purchasing an item from a seller) (each, a “ **Buyer** ”), we share personally identifiable information about you with that ecomdash Client in order to assist you with the bidding and buying process as well as to assist ecomdash Clients with the selling process. Ecomdash will retain your information at ecomdash to support the transaction. To the extent that ecomdash Clients  have access to a Buyer’s personally identifiable information, ecomdash does not control the use of such personally identifiable information by such Clients and Clients are only obligated to treat this information in no less a secure manner than they treat the personally identifiable information of customers who purchase directly through the Client’s website. If you are a Buyer, you are encouraged to review the privacy policies of the ecomdash Clients that provide the products or services related to your bid or purchase to understand how your personally identifiable information may be used by them. Buyers should contact ecomdash Clients directly and review their privacy policies should you have questions concerning their use of your information such as, for example, communications you may or may not wish to receive.

**Customer Support.**  Contact information provided by a Buyer to ecomdash in connection with problems, comments or requests about our Site or the Services is used only to respond to those problems, comments or requests and may be provided to ecomdash Clients or third parties as necessary to respond to the comment, problem or request.

Ecomdash also may use information a Buyer provides to make a Buyer aware of new products or special offers or promotions. Ecomdash will abide by requests from you to discontinue such use.  As a Buyer, if you receive communications directly from an ecomdash Client, you should contact the ecomdash Client directly concerning such communications and review their privacy policies.  A Buyer will receive such information as described in this Section unless a Buyer has opted out of receiving such information from ecomdash as part of the checkout process.  Outside of the checkout process, Buyers may also opt out of receiving such information (if you have not already opted out of receiving it) by sending a request as described below in “Your Choices; Access to, Review of and Modifications to Your Personally Identifiable Information”.

**Providing Ecomdash Buyer Information to Third Parties for Marketing/Solicitation (for ecomdash Buyers only).  **If you are a Buyer, ecomdash does not sell your personally identifiable information to third parties for purposes of marketing or soliciting you, provided however, we may share personally identifiable information, including credit or debit account information, with a third party upon your prior consent (opt-out).  To the extent that ecomdash Clients (for example, a seller of an item you purchased) have access to your personally identifiable information as a result of your bidding or buying, where ecomdash provides your information to ecomdash Clients as part of a transaction you may be involved in with such ecomdash Client, these entities may solicit or market to you in accordance with their policies. As a Buyer, you are encouraged to review the privacy policies of the ecomdash Clients that provide the products or services related to your bid or purchase. You should contact ecomdash Clients directly and review their privacy policies should you have questions concerning their use of your personally identifiable information such as, for example, communications you may or may not wish to receive.

As an ecomdash Client, you may opt-out of ecomdash providing such information to third parties at any time by updating your Personal Account Settings or by contacting ecomdash. You should contact the third party directly who may already be sending you messages in order to request these communications stop, and to review their privacy policies.

**Bidding, Buying, Selling History.  **Ecomdash may use any information collected related to a Buyer or ecomdash Client’s bidding, buying or selling history to generate recommendations and predictions related to likelihood of your willingness to complete a bid and may submit such history and recommendations to ecomdash Clients.

**YOUR CHOICES; ACCESS TO, REVIEW OF AND MODIFICATIONS TO YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION**

**Data Integrity; Choice.**  Ecomdash will use personally identifiable information only in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by a User. Ecomdash will take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete and current.  Ecomdash will offer Users the opportunity to choose (opt-out) whether their personally identifiable information is to be disclosed to a third party or used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the User.

You may access, modify, remove, correct or update personally identifiable information by contacting ecomdash (see “How To Contact Us” section below). To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections. Please note that we may not be able to correct or update your personally identifiable information previously provided to us by third parties.

If you receive any promotional email communication from us, you will be given the option to “unsubscribe” from receiving further email communications from us at any time.  Your option not to receive promotional and marketing material from us will not preclude us from corresponding with you, by email or otherwise, regarding your existing or past business relationship with us.  Ecomdash may retain transactional history in order to document a transaction you may have had with an ecomdash Client. You should contact the ecomdash Client (for example, the seller of an item you have purchased) directly in order to access, modify or update your personally identifiable information with them.

**LINKS TO OTHER SITES**

As a part of the Services, ecomdash provides links to websites operated by third parties (including ecomdash Clients) that are not controlled by us. These links are made available to you as a convenience and you agree to use these links at your own risk. Ecomdash is not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices or the content of those third party sites. This Privacy Policy only applies to information we collect from you while you are using the Site or our Services. Users should check the privacy policies of any website prior to use.

**DO-NOT-TRACK; THIRD PARTY TRACKING**

Unless your browser settings are configured to make your online activities and publicly available information about your online activities invisible to usage analytics tools, we do not presently have the capability to omit you from usage analytics to the extent your browser only sends us a “do not track” message and does not otherwise screen you from tracking without any action on our part.  To learn more about browser tracking signals and “do not track”, visit [http://allaboutdnt.org](http://allaboutdnt.org/).  Third parties, other than our service providers, do not have our permission to track which websites you visit prior to and/or after visiting our Site.  That said, we cannot control all third-party tracking, and there may be third-party tracking without our knowledge or consent.
