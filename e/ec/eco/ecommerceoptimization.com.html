		<h2 class="sidebar">eCommerce Optimization Blog Privacy</h2>
<p>eCommerce Optimization makes every effort to protect our readers privacy. We collect limited personal information so that we can better serve you, and that personal information will never be shared with any third party without your explicit permission. We do not sell our readers information, nor do we share it with any third parties without their explicit permission, or if we are required to by a law enforcement agency that has the appropriate legal jurisdiction.</p>
<h2 class="sidebar">Confidentiality &amp; Transmissions</h2>
<p>The transmission of data or information (including communications by email or form) over the Internet or other publicly accessible networks is not secure, and is subject to possible loss, interception or alteration while in transit. Accordingly, eCommerce Optimization does not assume any liability for any damage you may experience or costs you may incur as a result of any transmissions over the Internet or other publicly accessible networks, such as transmissions involving the exchange of e-mail with us (including those which may contain your personal information). We don’t care. We make no efforts to safeguard the privacy of the information you provide us, period. In no event will the information you provide to us be deemed to be confidential, create any fiduciary obligations to you on our part, or result in any liability to you on our part in the event that such information is inadvertently released by us or accessed by third parties without our consent.</p>
<h2 class="sidebar">User Conduct &amp; Obligations</h2>
<p>You agree to follow all applicable laws and regulations when using this blog and further agree that you will not transmit spam mail, chain letters, or other unsolicited bulk email or duplicate messages to any email address listed on this blog.

<h2 class="sidebar">Logging in</h2>
<p>When you log in to post comments, we will ask for your name, email address and optionally your Website location. We ask for your email address so that we can verify your email address, so other people cannot register for you. We do this to protect you and your email account.</p>
<h2 class="sidebar">Purchasing services</h2>
<p>If you purchase services from us, we will ask for the minimum information necessary to verify that you are authorized to make the purchase, that you are who you say, and not someone else with your credit card. We will ask for your address, your credit card information, including the expiration date to make sure that the card owner is the one who is using it. If you notice any charges from our site that you did not authorize, please contact your bank first, and then contact us so we can resolve any issues.</p>
<h2 class="sidebar">Polls or surveys</h2>
<p>We may, from time to time, have site polls or surveys in which we will ask for certain demographic information, along with your opinions of our site. Any information we request for these polls is strictly for internal purposes, to help us understand our readers. We may share cumulative data with our partners (average age of our users, etc.), but we will never share with our partners your name, your personal information, or your contact information. This demographic data will be entirely anonymous, and only for statistical purposes. If you receive any email correspondence claiming to be from eCommerce Optimization that includes requests for your personal information or that asks you to log into any URL that does NOT begin with eCommerceoptimization.com, please report it to us immediately.</p>

We cannot be held responsible for the content or means of this communication, and we recommend that you only share information that you would normally share in an Online community with thousands of other people.</p>
<h2 class="sidebar">Links</h2>
<p>At times, we may have links on our site to our partners, or readers may post URLs to their own sites. We attempt to closely watch over and guard your personal information, but we cannot be held responsible for these sites and their individual business practices. If we discover that one of these sites is behaving fraudulently or is neglecting the privacy of its users, we will remove the links to that site as soon as possible.
