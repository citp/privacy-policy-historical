This may include checking of age, residence, nationality, financial position. We are doing this to make sure You (or the Business Entity You represent) have told Us true and correct information, to confirm Your identity and to detect and prevent financial crime, fraud and money-laundering risks.
  * **Detecting fraud.** We use Your personal information to detect if Your (or the Business Entity’s You represent) ecoAccount is perhaps used for financial crime, fraud or money-laundering or being used or is used in the manner that potentially abuses ecoPayz Services or violates the Terms of Use. We may detect that an ecoAccount is used in a way that is unusual for Your (or to the Business Entity You represent). We may at Our discretion suspend or otherwise restrict the functionality of Your (or the Business Entity’s Your represent) ecoAccount at any time, if We suspect unauthorised or fraudulent use of Your (or the Business Entity’s You represent) ecoAccount or that it has been accessed without Your (or the Business Entity’s You represent) authorization.
  * **Fees.** We may decide what fees should be determined for some services on the basis of what We know.
  * **Tailoring ecoPayz Services and other services similar to or connected with ecoPayz Services.** We may place You (or the Business Entity You represent) in groups with similar customers. These are called customer segments. We use these to study and learn about Our customers’ needs and to make decisions based on what We learn. This helps Us to design ecoPayz Services and other services similar to or connected with ecoPayz Services for different customer segments, and to manage Our relationships with them.



10.3 As an individual You have rights over automated decisions. You have the right:

  * To ask Us not to make our decisions based on the automated means alone.
  * To object an automated decision and ask that an individual reviews it.
