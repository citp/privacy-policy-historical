eCornell participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. eCornell is committed to subjecting all personal data received from European Union (EU) member countries, in reliance on the Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework’s applicable Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List. 

eCornell processes Personal Data both as a Processor and as a Controller as defined in the EU’s General Data Protection Directive (GDPR) and transfers data outside of the EU. eCornell adheres to the GDPR requirements for capturing consent of users for collection of data, securing covered data, and providing a right to be forgotten.

eCornell’s privacy policy, as provided above, describes the types of personal information that eCornell collects, the types of third parties to which it discloses personal data, and the purposes for which it does so. eCornell collects contact and demographic information to respond to requests or to personalize and deliver the services. eCornell transfers this information to third parties acting as an agent on its behalf. eCornell is accountable for the processing of personal data it receives, under the Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party. eCornell complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU, including the onward transfer liability provisions.

Residents of the EU have the right to access the personal information that eCornell maintains, and in some cases, may have the right to correct or amend information that is inaccurate or has been processed in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles, to the extent allowed by law. eCornell account holders may access and modify their personal information at any time through eCornell’s student portal: [https://portal.ecornell.com](https://portal.ecornell.com/). Residents of the EU may request that we delete any Personally Identifiable Information which we hold about the user.

Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator’s award.
