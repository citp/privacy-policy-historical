Information We Collect When You Use Our Services. We automatically collect information about you when you use our Services. For example, we may collect:</p> <ul style="list-style-type: disc;"> <li><strong>Transaction Information:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;When you use our kiosks, we collect information about your transaction, including but not limited to the transaction amount, date, time and location.
