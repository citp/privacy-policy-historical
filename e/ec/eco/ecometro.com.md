### 3\. What kind of information do we collect and store?

When you use our Chinook Book app and/or chinookbook.net, you provide us with two types of information: Personal Information that you knowingly and voluntarily provide, and Automatically-Collected Information that we collect as you browse and use the app and/or chinookbook.net. 

**(a) Your Personal Information**

In order to download the Chinook Book app, to register for an account through and to use the app, to purchase a Chinook Book through chinookbook.net, and/or to participate in certain other services provided by Celilo, you will be asked to provide Personal Information. **You are never under any obligation to provide such information.** If you choose not to provide us Personal Information, you can still browse chinookbook.net; however, you will not be able to purchase a Chinook Book, use the app, or use certain other services offered by Celilo.

**(b) Automatically-collected information we receive from your use of our Chinook Book app and/or chinookbook.net**

When you use the Chinook Book app and/or chinookbook.net, we automatically collect and store the following categories of information (hereinafter referred to as "Automatically-Collected Information"). Unless otherwise specifically stated in this Privacy Policy, Automatically-Collected Information may be combined with Personal Information you provide to us. We automatically collect and store the following types of information when you use the Chinook Book app: 

  1. Your mobile device and network identifiers, such as MAC or IP addresses; 
  2. Your mobile device's unique device ID; 
  3. Geo-Location Data: We track your real-time, precise geo-location data at the time you set up an account, purchase a pack of coupons, redeem a coupon, switch to a different geographic market, or take any other action through the app. We do not continuously track your geo-location data; rather, we only track it at the time you take any action through the app. We collect this data so we can aggregate all of our user geo-location data and provide only the de-identified and aggregated coupon redemption data to merchants for their analysis so they can, for example, determine how often a coupon is redeemed at a given store location. We do NOT provide your specific geo-location data along with your identity to any third party; rather, we only provide the aggregated redemption data to our merchants; 
  4. Your coupon history, including purchases, unlocks, redemptions, favorites, and savings; 
  5. Domain server; 
  6. Type of mobile device accessing the app; 
  7. Type of operating system your mobile device uses; 
  8. Date and time you access the app and date and time you use the app to redeem specific coupons; 
  9. Amount of time you spend on each app feature; 
  10. Order in which you view the app features and pages, and the order in which you take actions in the app; and 
  11. Other similar information about the interaction between your browser and the app. 



We automatically collect and store the following types of information when you use chinookbook.net: 

  1. Your MAC addresses or IP addresses; 
  2. Domain server; 
  3. Type of computer and web browser used to access chinookbook.net; 
  4. Type of operating system your computer uses;

  6. Referring source, _i.e.,_ the website you used to access chinookbook.net; 
  7. Amount of time you spend on each chinookbook.net page and feature you use; 
  8. Order in which you view the features and pages on chinookbook.net, and the order in which you take actions on chinookbook.net; and 
  9. Other similar information about the interaction between your browser and chinookbook.net. 



**(c) Information we do NOT collect:** When you use our Chinook Book app or Chinookbook.net, we do **NOT** (i) track your activity across multiple applications or websites, and we do not allow targeted advertising based on your activity across multiple applications or websites; (ii) access or store your contacts, call logs, calendar appointments, text messages, photos, videos, or other information stored on your mobile device; (iii) access or store your usernames or passwords (other than that which you use to set up your account through the Chinook Book app), such as username and passwords for your Facebook, Twitter, or other social network or email accounts; (iv) share your information with social networks, advertising networks, or other third parties for their own marketing or other independent purposes. In order to provide the services offered through the app, however, the app may interact with some features of your mobile device, such as your email account, but all of this processing occurs on your mobile device itself, and this information is not transferred through the app to us. 

### 4\. Cookies and Web Beacons

We collect Automatically-Collected Information through commonly-used information gathering tools, such as cookies and web beacons.   
**(a) Cookies:** To help make the Chinook Book app and chinookbook.net more responsive to the needs of our users, we may use a standard feature found in browser software, called a "cookie" to assign each visitor a unique, random number, a sort of anonymous user ID that resides in your mobile device if you use the app and in your computer hard drive if you use chinookbook.net. Standing alone, cookies do not identify the Personal Information of the user; rather, they identify the mobile device that a user uses to access the app, or they identify the computer that a user uses to access chinookbook.net. A cookie cannot read data off of your hard drive or mobile device. Cookies may store user preferences, information about your browser, list of app and/or chinookbook.net features used, and activities conducted while using the app and/or chinookbook.net. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but, at your option, expense, and responsibility, you can block cookies at any time by changing the preferences in your browser and/or delete cookies from your hard drive and mobile device. By blocking and deleting cookies, however, you may not have access to the entire set of features of the app or chinookbook.net and features may not function properly. Generally, we use cookies to customize your experience while using the app and chinookbook.net. When you use the app to create an account, we use cookies to store your username so you do not have to re-enter it each time you want to access your account. Further, if you have an account through the app, cookies containing encrypted information allow us to uniquely identify you when you are logged into your account. Cookies enable us to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. We may use cookies to remember your personal settings, pre-fill forms for you by saving your preferences for future visits, and compile aggregate data about user traffic on and user interaction with the app and chinookbook.net so we can offer better experiences and tools in the future.   
**(b) Web Beacons:** We may also use "web beacons" to collect Automatically-Collected Information about your use of the Chinook Book app and/or chinookbook.net, and your viewing and use of emails we send to you. Web beacons are graphic image files imbedded in a web page, app feature, or email that provide a presence on such web page, feature, or email and send back to its home server information from the user's browser. The information collected by web beacons allows us to statistically monitor how many people are using the app and chinookbook.net and opening our emails, and for what purposes. For example, we might place a web beacon in a marketing email to notify us when a user clicks on the link in the email. We do not collect Personal Information with web beacons, and we do not link information retrieved from web beacons directly with Personal Information you've given us. 

### 5\. How We Use Your Information

**(a) Personal Information and Automatically-Collected Information**

When you supply us with your Personal Information, we will use it for the express purpose stated when we ask for such Personal Information ( _e.g.,_ we use your Personal Information to fulfill any transaction you initiate, such as the purchase of a Chinook Book), to respond to any requests you may have about use of the Chinook Book app or chinookbook.net, to contact you regarding your account or your use of the app or chinookbook.net, and to provide required notices. 

**Credit card information:** We use your credit card information to fulfill purchase orders you initiate. We provide data encryption during the entire payment process. We will only use your credit card information to charge you for a Chinook Book or coupon packs if specifically ordered by you. 

If you order a Chinook Book through chinookbook.net, we only retain your credit card information to complete you order. We do not retain your credit card information after the transaction is complete. We only share your credit card information with your credit card provider, as well as our banking partners, to process payments. 

If you use the Chinook Book app to order Chinook coupon packs, we use a third-party intermediary to manage credit card payment processing. We only share your credit card information with this third-party intermediary, your credit card provider, and our banking partners, to process payments. We may provide an auto-renew feature that you can select so that we will automatically provide you coupon packs within a given time period. If you select this feature, our third-party intermediary will store your credit card information, but this third-party can only use your credit card information to process payments for your purchase of coupon packs. If you do not select this auto-renew feature, our third-party intermediary will not store your credit card information and will delete it after processing your single purchase transaction. Because we collect credit card information (and because it's generally a good idea), we recommend that you lock your mobile device. If you lose your mobile device or if it is stolen, we recommend that you immediately contact your mobile device carrier to have the device and the Chinook Book app disabled. We shall have no responsibility or liability to pay for any unauthorized or fraudulent transactions. 

**IP Addresses:** We use IP/MAC addresses to track and aggregate Automatically-Collected Information. We also collect IP/MAC addresses and mobile device IDs from our app users when they log into their accounts in order to confirm the applicable user's identity. 

**Your coupon history, including purchases, unlocks, redemptions, favorites and savings:** For app users, we store coupon history information on our server so the app can be deleted from your device without losing coupons, favorites, or savings. This allows coupon account information to be transferred to new devices, such as a replacement or upgraded device. 

**Other Uses of Your Personal Information and Automatically-Collected Information:** We may use your Personal Information and Automatically-Collected Information to customize and tailor your experience using the app and/or chinookbook.net, displaying content we think you might be interested in and according to your preferences (but we do not track your activity across multiple websites or mobile applications for the purposes of serving targeted advertising to you). 

We may use Personal Information and Automatically-Collected Information to help diagnose problems with the app and chinookbook.net , to make the app and chinookbook.net more compatible with the technology used by our users, to analyze statistical use patterns, and to otherwise improve our app and chinookbook.net. For example, we may use Automatically-Collected Information to track what our users look at most so we can recognize and provide more of the desired features. 

We also use Automatically-Collected Information to determine which website referred you to chinookbook.net and as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. 

**(b) Marketing Communications:** We may use your Contact Data to provide you information about other products or services that may be of interest to you (including those we may offer jointly with other companies). We may also send your mobile device notifications from time to time to alert you to new coupons or new available versions of the app. We will never share your Contact Data with any third party for their own marketing or other independent uses. If we use your Contact Data to send marketing communications to you, we will provide you with an easy mechanism to opt-out of receiving future marketing communications (see Section 7(a) below for more information). If you request that we not contact you for marketing purposes (either by using the opt-out mechanism or contacting us), we reserve the right to contact you for non-marketing purposes relating to your account or other use of the app or chinookbook.net. We respect your privacy and your right to limit the ways in which we contact you. 

### 6\. Sharing your information:

Except in the circumstances described in this Privacy Policy, Celilo does not share, sell, rent, license, trade, or otherwise transfer or disclose your Personal Information or Automatically-Collected Information with or to any third parties for their promotional purposes or otherwise. 

**(a) Merchants:** From time to time, we share de-identified and aggregated coupon redemption data (including the date, time, and location of redemptions) and favorite coupon data with our merchants to help them improve their offers. We share this aggregated, anonymous redemption information with merchants to help them track redemptions. Celilo will never give merchants Contact Data, specific device information, network identifiers, or information that personally identifies you. 

**(b) Third-Party Service Providers:** We share Personal Information and Automatically-Collected Information with our third-party service providers who assist us by performing services related to our operation of the Chinook Book app or chinookbook.net (such as hosting, data storage, transaction processing, and security). These third-party service providers are not authorized to use your information in any way other than as described here and are required to keep the information confidential. 

**(c)Third-Party Analytics Services:** We may use third-party analytics services in connection with the Chinook Book app and chinookbook.net to assist us in better understanding our app and chinookbook.net users. For example, we use these services to track and analyze certain Automatically-Collected Information, such as feature usage. We only ever provide these service providers with (or allow these service providers to collect on our behalf) Automatically-Collected Information. The recordings will never identify you personally, though they can identify your IP/MAC addresses and mobile device IDs. We use the information collected from these service providers to find usability problems to make the app and chinookbook.net easier to use. The information we receive from these third parties may be re-associated with your Personal Information after we receive it back from these third parties. These third parties are not authorized to use your information in any other way and are required to keep the information confidential. 

**(d) Merger, Acquisition, or Sale:** We may transfer your Personal Information and Automatically-Collected Information to another entity if Celilo is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or any portion of its assets or business. In this event, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you when Personal Information and Automatically-Collected Information is transferred to a third party, as well as to notify you about choices you may have regarding your information (this notification may be made via email to you or by posting a prominent notice within the Chinook Book app and on chinookbook.net). Unless you consent otherwise, your Personal Information will remain subject to the promises made in this Privacy Policy, even after the transfer. But any Personal Information and Automatically-Collected Information you provide after the transfer will likely be subject to a new privacy policy, and you should review that policy. 

**(e) Required by Law:** Celilo reserves the right to and will release Personal Information and/or Automatically-Collected Information, without your consent and without additional notice to you, if Celilo believes in good faith that (i) such release is required to comply with any law, rule, or regulation, or any search warrant, subpoena, court order, or similar legal process; or (ii) disclosure is necessary to protect or enforce Celilo's rights or property, to protect the rights or property of others, to protect your safety or the safety of others, in emergency situations, to defend against legal claims, or to take action regarding illegal activities or suspected fraud.

### 10\. Security of Information
