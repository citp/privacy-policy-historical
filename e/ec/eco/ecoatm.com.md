# ecoATM Automated eCycling Stations

ecoATM operates our services with the protection of your privacy as a high priority. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy, the types of personal information we gather when you use ecoATM services, and the steps we take to safeguard it.

**Types of Information Collected**  
The registration forms and/or image capture in use in our kiosks gather personal information that is personally identifiable, including the following: first and last names, physical address, email address, phone number, date of birth, photographs, thumbprint, and similar information that is not otherwise publicly available, when voluntarily submitted by you. For example, ecoATM is often required by local or State law when buying a phone with a serial number to collect personal information from you such as an image of your driver’s license and a thumbprint. Another example is if you sell your phone at an ecoATM but do not erase personal data stored on the phone beforehand.  

**Use of Information Collected**  
Please take some time to familiarize yourself with the different ways ecoATM uses the information that it gathers. Keep in mind that, while ecoATM encourages all third parties involved – including but not limited to subsequent purchasers– to adhere to our policies regarding handling any personally identifiable information on any recycled cellular phone, we cannot and do not assume any responsibility for any actions or omissions of third parties, including the manner in which they use such information.

ecoATM provides notice at each kiosk that personally identifiable information will be collected during the registration process. Such notice is provided simultaneously with the ecoATM registration; moreover, this Privacy Policy itself serves as notice that such information is collected under those circumstances.

If you choose to opt in to participate in ecoATM’s mobile applications or messaging service, then ecoATM reserves the right to send text messages and notices to your cellular phone. If you choose to participate in the email program, then ecoATM reserves the right to send email messages to your email account. ecoATM has numerous safeguards in place to comply with federal regulations regarding privacy, and our messaging system will comply with all state and federal regulations and follows the guidelines of the industry as written by the Mobile Marketing Association.

Although you may not “opt out” of the registration process or the capture of your ID and thumbprint if you wish to resell your cellular phone, you may choose to “opt out” of our text messaging, email, or mobile applications programs. ecoATM limits its own text and e-mail distributions to those customers who have not “opted out” of receiving such communications. These texts and emails will clearly indicate the originator of the text or e-mail and provide you with a method of “opting out” of receiving future communications of a similar nature.

Except as expressly set forth in this Privacy Policy, ecoATM does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies.

ecoATM may on occasion send marketing information on behalf of one of our business partners about products or services they provide that may be of interest to you. ecoATM will not share your personal information with such partners but rather will send a mailing or email on behalf of those partners.

Companies may from time to time be engaged by ecoATM to perform a variety of functions on behalf of ecoATM, including filling orders, assisting with promotions, providing technical services for our web site. These companies may have access to personal information as needed to perform such functions. However, these companies may only use such personal information for the purpose of performing that function and may not use if for any other purpose.

We reserve the right to release personally identifiable information when requested by law-enforcement or when the customer is reasonably suspected of partaking in any illegal activity, even without a subpoena, warrant or other court order, and to release such information in response to court and governmental orders, civil subpoenas, discovery requests and as otherwise required by law. We also provide personally identifiable information we have collected in order to comply with various state, county and municipal legal obligations, generally in connection with complying with Second Hand Dealer Laws. We cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who may be using our services for illegal activities. We also reserve the right to report any suspected illegal activity to law enforcement individuals or entities for investigation or prosecution.

We may transfer information about you if ecoATM is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, ecoATM will post a notice on its website before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

**Confidentiality and Security**  
We limit access to personal information about you to our employees and agents who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.

Your information is stored on our servers located in the United States. We treat data as an asset that must be protected and use many tools (encryption, passwords, physical security, etc.) to protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the site. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private. Because email and instant messaging are not recognized as secure communications, we request that you not send private information to us by email or instant messaging services.

**Third Party Links**  
This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that ecoATM does not own or control or to people that ecoATM does not employ or manage. The sites linked to by ecoATM’s services are developed by people over whom ecoATM exercises no control. These other sites may place their own cookies on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information. ecoATM does not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others. For more information about each such third party, please refer to the third party's privacy policy.

**Information Residing on Recycled Phones**  
The cellular phones that are recycled may include personally identifiable information. ecoATM offers several options for customers to remove personally identifiable information from the cellular phones, but ecoATM makes no guarantees regarding third party’s access and use of such personally identifiable information and strongly encourages you to delete all personally identifiable information on each phone prior to recycling.

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**  
ecoATM will occasionally update this Privacy Policy as our business and products evolve. When we do, we will also revise the date at the top of this Privacy Policy. Any changes we make will be effective immediately upon notice, which we may provide by means including, without limitation, posting the revised Privacy Policy on our website. Be sure to return to this page periodically to ensure familiarity with the most current version of this Privacy Policy.
