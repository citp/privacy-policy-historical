This policy summarizes the collection and use of information gathered by the Ecolab website and other relevant privacy issues. By using our website (the “Website”) you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy. 

Ecolab reserves the right to change this policy at any time and from time to time. Any updates or modifications will be posted promptly on this page and will be effective immediately. Please review the Privacy Policy each time you visit the website. By continuing to use the website, you accept and agree to be bound by the most recent version of the Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to be bound by the Privacy Policy, you may not view, access or use the website.

## **Children’s Privacy**

The website is intended for use by individuals 13 years of age or older. Ecolab has no intention of collecting any personal information from children under the age of 13. Children under 13 should not submit personal information without the consent and guidance of a parent or legal guardian. We do not knowingly collect information from children online.

## **What Information We Collect**

Certain technical information, such as the type of browser or operating system used and user domain name, may be automatically collected in an aggregate, non-identifiable form. This information enables Ecolab to measure site usage and improve this site to better suit customer needs. In general, you can browse our website without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. We are, however, able to determine your IP address. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our website, to measure the use of our website and to improve the content of our website. In short we use your IP address to gather aggregate demographic information and we may use such aggregate demographic information, which will not include your IP Address, without restriction. We use “cookies” to track your use of the website and to improve your experience in using the website. These cookies do not generally include personal information. You may choose to disable “cookies” through your browser settings, but this may impact your experience in using the website.

There are a few places where Ecolab collects personal information voluntarily provided by users of this site. This information lets us know the specifics of who you are. If you choose to share any personal information with us, you will see that the amount and type of personal information we request depend on how you use our website. It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities. If you elect to engage in these activities, however, we may ask that you provide us personal information, such as your first and last name, mailing address (including zip code), email address, telephone and fax numbers and other personal identifying information.

## **The Way We Use Information**

We may use your personal information for particular purposes such as marketing research and other marketing purposes and for providing you with the latest product and promotional information and other information that might be useful to you. We may use your personal information to deliver information to you and to contact you regarding administrative notices. We may share this information with Ecolab’s affiliated companies, subject to the restriction of this Privacy Policy. We may share this information with Ecolab dealers, subcontractors, service providers or other business partners for the limited purpose of supporting your customer relationship with Ecolab. Collected information will be used only for internal Ecolab purposes and will not be sold to third parties except in conjunction with a merger, stock sale, reorganization or the sale of a portion of our related business assets.

It may be necessary by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence for us to disclose your personal information and we reserve the right to do so without notifying you of such disclosure. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.

We may also disclose information about you if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce the relevant terms of use for the Website or protect our operations or users.

## **Miscellaneous**

Our website may contain links to sites of other organizations. Ecolab is not responsible for the content of any of those sites and cannot guarantee that they maintain the same privacy standards. Refer to the privacy policies of those sites if you have any concerns.
