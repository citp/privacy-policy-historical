# Privacy Policy - Econlib

**Privacy Policy**  
Neither the Library of Economics and Liberty, EconTalk, EconLog, nor their owner, Liberty Fund, Inc., gather information about you that is tied to your name or email address unless you specifically request it. Information tied to your name or email address is not used for anything other than to contact you for matters directly related to your request.

• when you order books through Liberty Fund’s book catalog

Some of our mailing lists are maintained by reliable outside firms. If you register for any of these mailing lists, you are explicitly informed as part of the registration process. We try to select outside firms that have privacy policies as strong as our own, but we cannot guarantee the behavior of non-Econlib companies.
