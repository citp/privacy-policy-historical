THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU MAY BE USED AND DIS-
CLOSED AND HOW YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION. PLEASE REVIEW IT CAREFULLY.
This Notice describes privacy practices of Community Hospitals of Indiana, Inc., The Indiana Heart
Hospital and their affiliates, including: any health care professional authorized to enter informa-
tion into your health/medical records; the medical staffs of Community Hospital East, North, and
South; the medical staff of The Indiana Heart Hospital; the medical staffs of Indiana Surgery
Centers; all employees, staff, trainees, departments and units of Community Hospitals of Indiana,
Inc., The Indiana Heart Hospital and their affiliates, Indiana Surgery Centers and MedCheck facili-
ties; any volunteer group we allow to help you while you are receiving care; Community Medical
Research Institute; and Community Physicians of Indiana.
  I. Our Duty to Safeguard Your Protected Health Information:
Individually identifiable information about your past, present, or future health or condition, the
provision of health care to you, or payment for your health care is considered "Protected Health
Information" ("PHI"). We understand that medical information about you and your health is per-
sonal and we are committed to protecting medical information about you. We are required by law
to make sure that your PHI is kept private and to give you this Notice about our legal duties and
privacy practices, that explains how, when and why we may use or disclose your PHI. Except in
specified circumstances, we must use or disclose only the minimum necessary PHI to accomplish
the purpose of the use or disclosure.
We must follow the privacy practices described in this Notice, though we reserve the right to
change the terms of this Notice at any time. We reserve the right to make new Notice provi-
sions effective for all PHI we currently maintain or that we receive in the future. If we change this
Notice, we will post a new Notice in patient registration and/or patient waiting areas. The Notice
will contain the effective date on the first page, top right-hand corner. You may request a copy of
the new notice from the Patient Access Department and it will also be posted on our website at
www.eCommunity.com. We will also make available a copy of the Notice in effect each time you
are admitted to the hospital as an inpatient or outpatient, or receive health care services from
other health care providers within the Community Health Network, listed above.
  II. How We May Use and Disclose Your Protected Health Information:
We use and disclose PHI for a variety of reasons. For certain uses/disclosures, we must get your
written authorization. However, the law provides that we may make some uses/disclosures with-
out your authorization. The following section offers more description and examples of our poten-
tial uses/disclosures of your PHI.
     • Uses and Disclosures Relating to Treatment, Payment, or Health Care Operations.
Generally, we may use/disclose your PHI:
For treatment: We may disclose your PHI to doctors, nurses, and other health care personnel who
are involved in providing your health care. For example, your PHI will be shared among members
of your treatment team, our central pharmacy staff, or with a specialist to whom you have been
referred. If you are an inpatient, your name may be posted outside the door of your room. We may
also share PHI with health care provider licensing bodies like the Indiana State Department of
Health.


To obtain payment: We may use/disclose your PHI in order to bill and collect payment for your health care
services. For example, we may release portions of your PHI to Medicare/Medicaid, a private insurer or group
health plan to get paid for services that we delivered to you. Release of your PHI to the state Medicaid agency
might also be necessary to determine your eligibility for publicly funded services.
For health care operations: We may use/disclose your PHI in the course of our operations. For example, we
may use your PHI or your answers to a patient satisfaction survey in evaluating the quality of services pro-
vided by our staff, or disclose your PHI to our auditors or attorneys for audit or legal purposes. Since we are
an integrated system, we may share your PHI with designated staff within the Community Health Network,
for treatment, payment or operations purposes.
Appointment reminders: Unless you provide us with alternative instructions, we may send appointment
reminders and other similar materials to your home. We may also call your home and leave a message on
your answering machine or voice mail. (See Section III about confidential communication.)
Treatment alternatives: We may contact you about possible treatment options or alternatives, or other
health-related benefits or services that may interest you.
Fundraising: We or our Foundation may contact you to raise money for the Network and its operations, unless
you tell us in writing not to contact you for this purpose.
  • Uses and Disclosures Requiring Authorization: For uses and disclosures other than treatment, payment
and operations purposes, we are required to have your written authorization, unless the use or disclosure falls
within one of the exceptions described below. You may revoke an authorization, in writing, any time to stop
future uses/disclosures. If you revoke your authorization, we will stop using/disclosing your PHI for the pur-
poses or reasons covered by your written authorization. You understand that we are unable to take back dis-
closures we have already made with your permission and that we are required to keep our records of the care
we provided to you. (See Section VI for instructions for revoking an authorization.) We cannot refuse to treat
you if you refuse to sign an authorization to release PHI, unless services provided are solely to create health
records for a third party, such as physical and drug testing for an employer or insurance company; or if treat-
ment provided is research-related and authorization is required for the use of health information for research
purposes.
  • Uses and Disclosures Not Requiring Authorization: The law provides that we may use/disclose your PHI
without your authorization in the following circumstances:
When required by law: We may disclose PHI when a law requires that we report information about sus-
pected abuse, neglect or domestic violence, or relating to suspected criminal activity, for FDA-regulated
products or activities, or in response to a court order. We must also disclose PHI to authorities that monitor
compliance with these privacy requirements.
For public health activities: We may disclose PHI when we are required to collect information about dis-
ease or injury, or to report vital statistics to the public health authority, such as reports of tuberculosis cases
or births and deaths.
For health oversight activities: We may disclose PHI to the Indiana State Department of Health or other
agencies responsible for monitoring the health care system for such purposes as reporting or investigation
of unusual incidents.
Relating to decedents: We may disclose PHI relating to an individual's death to coroners, medical examin-
ers or funeral directors, and to organ procurement organizations relating to organ, eye, or tissue donations or
transplants.
For research purposes: In certain circumstances, and under supervision of the Institutional Review Board of
the Community Health Network, we may disclose PHI in order to assist medical research, such as comparing
the health and recovery of all patients who received one medicine to those who received another. We will
almost always ask you for your specific permission if the researcher will have access to your name, address
and other PHI, or will be involved in your care.


To avert threat to health or safety: In order to avoid a serious threat to health or safety, we may disclose
PHI as necessary to law enforcement or other persons who can reasonably prevent or lessen the threat of
harm.
Law enforcement: We may disclose PHI to a law enforcement official in circumstances such as: in response
to a court order; to identify a suspect, witness or missing person; about crime victims; about a death that we
may suspect is the result of criminal conduct; or criminal conduct at the hospital or health care facility.
For specific government functions: We may disclose PHI of military personnel and veterans in certain situ-
ations; to correctional facilities in certain situations; and for national security and intelligence reasons, such as
protection of the President.
Workers’ Compensation: We may disclose your PHI to your employer for Workers’ Compensation or similar
programs that provide benefits for work-related illness or injuries.
Inmates: An inmate does not have rights listed in this Notice of Privacy Practices. The rights listed in this
notice will not apply to inmates of a correctional institution.
  • Uses and Disclosures Requiring You to Have an Opportunity to Object: In the following situations, we
may disclose your PHI if we inform you about the disclosure in advance and you have the opportunity to
agree to or prohibit or restrict the disclosure. However, if there is an emergency situation and you cannot be
given the opportunity to object, disclosure may be made if it is consistent with any prior expressed wishes
and the disclosure is determined to be in your best interests. You must be informed and given an opportu-
nity to object to further disclosure as soon as you are able to do so.
Patient Directories: Your name, location, general condition, and religious affiliation may be put into our
patient directory for use by callers or visitors who ask for you by name and by clergy.
To families, friends or others involved in your care: We may share with these people information directly
related to your family's, friend's or other person's involvement in your care, or payment for your care. We may
also share PHI with these people to notify them about your location, general condition, or death.
Disaster relief: We may release your PHI to a public or private relief agency for purposes of coordinating
notifying your family and friends of your location, condition or death in the event of a disaster.
  III. Your Rights Regarding Your Protected Health Information:
You have the following rights relating to your protected health information:
To request restrictions on uses/disclosures: You have the right to ask that we limit how we use or disclose
your PHI. You must make your request in writing. We will consider your request, but are not legally bound to
agree to the restriction. To the extent that we do agree to any restrictions on our use/disclosure of your PHI,
we will put the agreement in writing and abide by it except in emergency situations. If agreed upon, these
restrictions will only apply to Community Hospitals of Indiana, Inc.,The Indiana Heart Hospital and their affil-
iates listed in the beginning of this Notice. You understand that we are not able to take back disclosures
already made. We cannot agree to limit uses/disclosures that are required by law.
To request confidential communication: You have the right to ask that we send you information at an alter-
native address or by an alternative means, such as contacting you only at work. You must make your request
in writing. We must agree to your request as long as it is reasonably easy for us to do so.
To inspect and copy your PHI: Unless your access is restricted for clear and documented treatment reasons,
you have a right to see your protected health information if you put your request in writing. We will respond
to your request within 30 days. If we deny your access, we will give you written reasons for the denial and
explain any right to have the denial reviewed. If you want copies of your PHI, a charge for copying may be
imposed. You have a right to choose what portions of your information you want copied and to have infor-
mation on the cost of copying in advance.
To request amendment of your PHI: If you believe that there is a mistake or missing information in our
record of your PHI, you may request, in writing, that we correct or add to the record. Written requests must
include a reason that supports your request. We will respond within 60 days of receiving your request. We


may deny your request for an amendment if it is not in writing or does not include a reason to support the
request. We may also deny your request if we determine that the PHI is: (1) correct and complete; (2) not cre-
ated by us and/or not part of our records, or; (3) not permitted to be disclosed. Any denial will state the rea-
sons for denial and explain your rights to have the request and denial reviewed, along with any statement in
response that you provide, appended to your PHI. If we approve the request for amendment, we will change
the PHI and so inform you, and tell others that need to know about the change in the PHI.
To find out what disclosures have been made: You have a right to get a list of when, to whom, for what
purpose, and what content of your PHI has been released other than instances of disclosure for which you
gave your written authorization. (This is called an accounting of disclosures.) Your request can relate to dis-
closures going as far back as six years. The list will not include any disclosures made before April 14, 2003; for
national security purposes; for treatment, payment or operations purposes; through a facility directory; or to
law enforcement officials or correctional facilities. Your request must be in writing. We will respond to your
written request for such a list within 60 days of receiving it. There will be no charge for the first list request-
ed each year. There may be a charge for subsequent requests.
