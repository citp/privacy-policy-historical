## Security Measures

eCost Software's website has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. All account information you use or supply on our website when ordering or tracking products is completely secure. We use the most advanced encryption technology to protect you from unauthorised use of information supplied on our web site.

**Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)** is the industry standard security protocol used to encode sensitive information such as credit card numbers that pass between your personal computer and our website. SSL works by creating a temporary shared "key" or session that lets only the computers on either end of a transmission scramble and unscramble information. The SSL transmission is indecipherable by any individuals or servers that relay the message between the sender and the receiver. When your web browser enters eCost Software's secure website, our server hosting the site acknowledges your web browser with a "server hello". In return, your browser responds with a "client hello". This communication allows for the browser and server to determine the level of encryption they both support and will use. Once "hellos" are exchanged, your browser will ask for eCost Software's "digital certificate". The certificate acts as our "commerce ID" to ensure you that the transactions are between you and eCost Software. We receive digital certificates from a Certificate Authority, such as RSA Data Security Inc. or VeriSign Inc. A Certificate Authority verifies a company's identification and then issues a unique certificate as proof of identity. eCost Software use Secured by Thawte.

Next, the browser and the server create a "master key". This master key is a codebook that both sides use to encode and decode transmissions. Only your browser and our server share that master key which is good only for that particular session. The unique key allows your browser and our server to exchange sensitive information in a way third parties can't understand.

Once your transactions are complete and you leave our secure site, the master key you once held with the server becomes useless. When you re-enter the secure site, the hello, digital certificate and master key process start over again.
