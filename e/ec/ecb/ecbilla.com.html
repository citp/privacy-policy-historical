<h3> Security </h3>

The security of your personal information is important to us.

As a level 1 PCI-DSS compliant service provider we follow all PCI-DSS requirements and implement additional generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can email us at <span class="sup-ec">support@ecbilla.com</span>
</p>
<h3> Which means ? </h3>
<p>  We will encrypt your credit card and sensitive information at industry standards. Because stuff happens, we can't guarantee 100% security of your data. If you have questions email <span class="sup-ec">support@ecbilla.com</span> </p>

<h3> Cookies </h3>
<p>
A cookie is a small amount of data, which may include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to your browser from a web site and stored on your computer's hard drive. Every computer that accesses our website is assigned a different cookie by us. 
</p>

<h3> Google Analytics and Remarketing </h3>
<p>
We use a service provided by Google called Google Analytics (GA). GA permits us to reach people who have previously visited our site, and show them relevant advertisements when they visit other sites across the Internet in the Google Display Network. This is often called 'remarketing'. 
</p>
<p>
