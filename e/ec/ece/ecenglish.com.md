### Change to data protection legislation

The law in relation to data protection in the EU is changing in May 2018. This Privacy Policy has been updated with effect from 25 May 2018 to reflect your rights and to let you know how we collect and use personal information about you.   
We are committed to protecting your personal information. We will always keep your personal information safe and comply with applicable data protection legislation when using your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we will do that.

We are EC English Holdings Limited, a private limited company incorporated in (and subject to the laws of) Malta. Our registered address is at:  
EC Central  
St Julian’s Business Centre  
Elia Zammit Street  
St Julian’s STJ3153   
In this Privacy Policy, EC English Holdings Limited is also referred to as "EC", "we", "us" or "our".  
We are the “controller” of the personal information you provide to us.  
In addition to Malta we have local legal entities in the United Kingdom, Ireland, the United States of America, Canada and South Africa. This Privacy Policy covers the use of your information by us and our local legal entities (which form part of the EC English Holdings Limited group of companies).   
If you have any questions concerning any EC English Holdings Limited group entity, you can contact us using the details set out at the end of this Privacy Policy.

### What personal information we collect and why

Personal information is any information which identifies you personally, whether directly (for example, your name) or indirectly (for example, information about your use of our service).  
We collect information from you when you register on our site, subscribe to our newsletters, respond to one of our surveys, or fill out a form.  
When registering your details or making a booking for a service through our website or by completing a form, we may collect the following from you:

**Your name:** This allows us to refer to you when speaking to you and to address any post we may need to send to you specifically.

**Your telephone number:** This is needed to enable us to communicate with you. For example, we may need to call you back regarding a booking, or if we get disconnected from you. We may also call you in response to your expressed interest in EC, but will only do so if you tell us that you’re happy to be contacted in such a way.

**Your mailing address:** We need your address to communicate with you and, when required, to send you information and documents related to your booking.

**Your email address:** The email address you provide may be used to send you information and updates pertaining to your booking, and/or to occasionally send you company news, updates, or related product or service information.

**Your country of residence, country of birth, nationality, passport number and passport expiry date:** We need to know these details to help you with visa-related issues concerning your booking.

**Your date of birth:** We need to know your date of birth to ensure you are placed in the right age-level course and/or accommodation.

**Your gender:** We need to know your gender to ensure we place you in the appropriate accommodation.

**Your credit card information:** We need to know your credit card information to pay for services provided by us and to complete your booking if you are booking directly with us.

**Information about any needs you may have for additional assistance (which may include information concerning your health and any medical conditions you may have):** We may ask whether you have any needs for additional assistance that you would like us to take into account. This will help us tailor our services to you. For example, if you tell us that you have impaired mobility, we can ensure you are placed in accommodation that meets your needs. You don’t have to provide this information to us, and, if you choose not to, it won’t prevent us from providing our services to you (we may, however, be unable to provide any additional assistance).

**Your academic results** : When you study with us we will record and use your academic results to help us monitor your progress and set appropriate work in class and outside the classroom.

**Emergency contact details**. We need you to provide contact details for certain persons you have a close relationship to (for instance, your parents, spouse, partner, close friend or family member). We would only use this information in the event of an emergency situation involving you. By providing this information, you agree that you have informed the relevant person(s) of the provision of their contact details to us, and that they are happy for you to do so.

As part of providing our services to you, we may also collect the following information about you:

**Performance record** : We collect and use details of your performance during our programmes to help track your learning progress and to better tailor the future provision of our services to you.

You may request further information from us concerning the process we have followed here.    
You have the right to object to the decision we have arrived at. Please see **_Your rights_** below.    
Where we think there is a risk that one of your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms may be affected, we will not use your personal information unless we have obtained your consent to using it in that way.

**_For compliance with our legal obligations_**  
If asked, and if obligated and authorised to do so by law, we share your personal information with law enforcement agencies, regulators, courts or other public authorities.

**_For performance of our contract with you_**  
Aside from the information noted above that we use on the basis of our legitimate purposes and to comply with our legal obligations, we use the information we collect as part of our booking process to assist in entering into a contract with you to provide our services.

  * Information about your booking for up to ten years.
  * Information about details required to inform you of our activities and offers for up to five years (or the point at which you ask us to unsubscribe you from our mailing list).



Following these periods, we will stop using the relevant information and it will either be anonymised or deleted to the extent it is technically feasible to do so.   
In certain limited circumstances we may be required to retain your personal information for longer. When determining whether this is necessary for the purpose(s) for which it was provided, we take into account factors including:

  * The sensitivity of the personal data we are holding and business risks we face if we delete or anonymise the data.
