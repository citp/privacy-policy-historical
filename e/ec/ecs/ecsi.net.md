# General Privacy Statement

**Introduction**  
Educational Computer Systems, Inc. has a firm commitment to the privacy of individuals utilizing our Internet services. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this site; www.ecsi.net. 

**Usage Data**  
All web servers have the facility to automatically collect certain information that a web browser provides. This collection facility is commonly referred to as a usage log or a traffic log. 

ECSI's web site collects detail information such as IP address, domain name, browser, date, time and page accessed. This information is used in the general administration of our web site, diagnosing problems with the server and monitoring traffic patterns. The detail information collected is used only by ECSI staff for internal purposes. Email address information is not collected by our usage logs. You will not be contacted by ECSI personnel based on any entries in the usage log. No detail information collected in our usage logs will ever be given to any third-party. 

In addition to collecting detail information, ECSI may summarize the detail information and prepare aggregated information such as counts and flow patterns. This information is critical for the purposes of service monitoring, site improvement and content analysis. ECSI may periodically publish this summary data. Summary data will never contain any references to or information provided by an individual. 

ECSI monitors all unsuccessful access attempts to our servers. We reserver the right to disable any account or IP address/range which repeatedly makes unsuccessful access attempts or, in our judgement, is attempting to bypass our security. 

**Internet Passwords**  
ECSI may authorize users to access certain web pages or other Internet services by issuing a user ID and password combination. ECSI maintains a list of the user IDs assigned but does not retain any information about the password. No employee or representative of ECSI will ever ask for password information. If you are ever requested to provide your Internet password, do not provide it! You should immediately send an email to [Webmaster@ecsi.net](mailto:webmaster@ecsi.net) providing the date, time, employee's name (if available) and a brief description of the incident. 

Clients are assigned unique IDs and passwords. These accounts are assigned for the use of your organization only. You must not provide this information to anyone outside your organization. 

**Cookies and Web Bugs**  
ECSI does not use [cookies](http://www.cookiecentral.com/faq/) for any purpose at this time. If, at a future time, we decide to utilize [cookies](http://www.cookiecentral.com/faq/), ECSI will change this privacy statement and place a notice directly on our home page. 

ECSI does not use [Web Bugs](http://www.privacyfoundation.org/resources/webbug.asp) as a means of tracking visitors or providing information to third parties. We believe this practice is at best deceitful and have a firm policy prohibiting the use of [Web Bugs](http://www.privacyfoundation.org/resources/webbug.asp) on our site. 

**Client Information**  
ECSI maintains a database of client information including email addresses. The information ECSI has collected is not maintained or stored in a location that exposes this information to the Internet. All client information is contained on separate servers. 

This information is used only by ECSI staff for communicating with our clients. None of the information in our client database is ever knowingly released to any third-party without prior authorization by the client. 

**Mailing Lists**  
ECSI may periodically offer visitors to publish their Email address on our web site. We also offer the ability for individuals Any offer will contain a statement of intended use and availability. You will be given the choice of adding your name to the list. At no time are you 'automatically' added to a list without your consent. After you have placed your name on a list, you may request to have your entry removed at any time. To be removed, email [webmaster@ecsi.net](mailto:webmaster@ecsi.net). Include the page or pages from which you wish to be removed. In the future we will offer an automated "Opt-out" procedure. At that time, we will stop accepting email requests. 

**Exclusions**  
In the event that illegal activity (such as but not limited to 'hacking', harassment or violation of standing law or statue) using ECSI equipment or facilities are detected, the offender waives the protection offered in our privacy statement. Any data collected on the offender may then be made available to their domain administrators or any law enforcement agency with applicable authority. 

**Compliance**  
ECSI believes that it is compliance with all applicable privacy laws, regulations and guidelines published by the FTC and W3C. ECSI considers those laws, regulations and guidelines to be minimum standards. We will continually monitor customer and visitor comments and suggestions. This feedback will be used to adjust our privacy statement to better address the needs and desires of our clients.
