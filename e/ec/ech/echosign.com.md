# Adobe EchoSign privacy | Adobe - Privacy Policy

Effective: May 7, 2012

The [Adobe Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/privacy/policy.html) describes the general privacy practices of most of [Adobe’s websites and applications](https://web.archive.org/privacy/policy.html#cover), including Adobe® EchoSign®. More privacy-related information for Adobe EchoSign is provided below.

**What information does Adobe EchoSign collect about me other than as described in the Adobe Privacy Policy? How is the information used other than as described in the Adobe Privacy Policy?**

Adobe EchoSign a [hosted service ](https://web.archive.org/privacy/hosted-services.html)that Adobe offers to companies. When a company that uses Adobe EchoSign (the “sender”) sends a document to the “signer,” the signer may be required to provide personal information about him or herself in order to electronically sign the document.

In addition, we collect information about the sender’s and signer’s [use of Adobe EchoSign](https://web.archive.org/privacy/policy.html#info-collect) when exchanging and electronically signing a document in order to record information about the signing process.

All of this information is recorded as part of the "audit trail" that is linked to the electronically signed document, and is retained according to the agreement between Adobe and the sender.

If the sender requests that the signer’s identity be verified through our identity verification process, then additional information will be collected from the signer. As part of this process, information such as the signer’s government-issued identification number (or part of the number) and answers to challenge questions may be collected. Adobe does not store the identification number or the answers to the challenge questions. That information is used only to verify the signer’s identity through a company that provides the identity verification service on Adobe’s behalf.

In addition, the sender may request that the signer upload or attach copies of documents for a variety of purposes. For example, a sender may request that a signer upload documents that help the sender itself (not Adobe) verify the identity of the signer. With this feature, the sender will receive copies of the documents provided by the signer, and these will be stored along with the electronically signed copy of the document.

By default, Adobe EchoSign sends a copy of the electronically signed document to both the sender and the signer (although the sender can change this setting). The sender also controls how long documents are stored on Adobe EchoSign. The sender is responsible for configuring any security options available within Adobe EchoSign to protect the documents and their exchange between the sender and signer.

**How does Adobe EchoSign let me share data other than as described in the Adobe Privacy Policy?**

Adobe EchoSign integrates with several other websites, including social networking websites such as LinkedIn and Facebook. These features allow senders and signers to log into Adobe EchoSign using their accounts from the other websites. Also, senders may choose to link their Adobe EchoSign accounts with another online document service or sales automation service that the sender may use, such as Salesforce.com. In those cases, note that some personal information of the sender and signer, as well as any documents signed or identity documents provided by the signer, may be stored in these other services (as well as on Adobe EchoSign). The Adobe Privacy Policy does not apply to information or documents processed or stored on non-Adobe systems.
