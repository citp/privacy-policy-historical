This policy statement tells you how we collect information and how we use it. EchoMail follows seven core principles of privacy protection in the operation of its Web site:

  2. Choice/Consent to provide information
  3. Onward Transfer to a third party
  4. Access/Participation to/in your own data

**1\. NOTICE/AWARENESS**

This policy statement sets forth EchoMail information practices concerning the type of data that is collected at EchoMail’s Web site. This policy is being placed at a link on the bottom of EchoMail’s home page, a practice that is becoming an industry standard location for Web site privacy policies.

* * *

**2\. CHOICE/CONSENT**

The following paragraphs describe the type of information EchoMail collects and the reasons why EchoMail collects the information. By providing the information requested by EchoMail’s online forms and by continuing to use EchoMail’s Web site after having an opportunity to review EchoMail’s privacy policy, you have consented to EchoMail’s use of the information it collects as described at the point of collection or in this policy.

**User Supplied Information**  
In order to register to use EchoMail, you will be asked to supply contact information and billing information. We use this information to complete financial transactions compliant with user requests. The information we collect in this manner is not used for any other purpose.

EchoMail may disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) EchoMail’s rights or property or other users of the Web site, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. EchoMail may disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires the disclosure.

**EchoMail as an Application Service Provider**  
In most cases, when you see an Internet form, EchoMail has been asked by the website to act as an agent for form delivery, reporting or analysis at their website. The information EchoMail processes on such a website’s behalf belongs to that website and is not further used by EchoMail. EchoMail does not own the information collected and cannot use it for its own business purposes or in any way not authorized by our client.

**Your IP Address**  
EchoMail does not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that your session will be logged, but you remain anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our terms of use of the Web site or to protect our service, site, customers or others.

**Use of Cookies**  
EchoMail does not use cookies that contain any personally identifiable information.

**3\. ONWARD/TRANSFER**

(Transfers to Third Parties)  
To disclose information to a third party, organizations must apply the notice and choice principles. Where an organization wishes to transfer information to a third party that is acting as an agent (1), it may do so if it makes sure that the third party subscribes to the safe harbor principles or is subject to the Directive or another adequacy finding. As an alternative, the organization can enter into a written agreement with such third party requiring that the third party provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the relevant principles.

If you believe that an error has been made in the accuracy of the data collected from you, EchoMail will correct such error upon adequate verification of the error and the identity of the person seeking the correction.

If you wish to access, remove or correct any personally identifying data you have supplied to EchoMail you may do so by:

1\. Sending an E-Mail request to [privacy@echomail.com](mailto:privacy@echomail.com?Subject=Important%20Privacy%20Question)

2\. Sending a letter via U.S. Mail to:

Organizations must take reasonable precautions to protect personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.

**6\. INTEGRITY OF THE DATA COLLECTED**

Personal information must be relevant for the purposes for which it is to be used. An organization should take reasonable steps to ensure that data is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.

**Disclosure of Personal Information**  
Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.

At the present time, we DO NOT otherwise share personal information with other companies, except as is necessary in connection with our efforts to communicate with you.
