### Customer Proprietary Network Information Notice

This information regarding Customer Proprietary Network Information, or CPNI, is provided in accordance with federal regulations that require telecommunications carriers to provide notice concerning a carrier’s use of CPNI.

CPNI is the information that inContact gathers about its customers 1) that relates to the quantity, technical configuration, type, destination, and amount of use of telecommunications services subscribed to by its customers, and that is made available to inContact by the customer solely by virtue of the carrier-customer relationship; and 2) information contained in the bills pertaining to telephone exchange service or telephone toll service received by a customer of a carrier. CPNI does not include subscriber list information.

### Customer Privacy

inContact offers various communications-related services, including local and long distance service, and telecommunications equipment. In order to better serve your communication needs, from time to time we would like to share your CPNI across product lines within inContact. inContact would also like to share your CPNI on a limited, as-needed basis with trusted agents and independent contractors that assist inContact in providing you with communication-related services. These parties share a duty to protect your CPNI. Our use of CPNI may enhance our ability to offer products and services tailored to your specific needs. inContact will not sell your CPNI to third parties, or otherwise disclose your CPNI to third parties unless required to do so by operation of law.

### Customer Rights

CPNI is subject to federal and certain state laws and regulations. inContact is fully committed to complying with these CPNI laws and regulations. You have the right to protection of your confidential information and inContact has the duty to protect that information.

If you prefer that inContact not use, disclose, or allow access to your CPNI to offer you our communications- related products and services to which you do not already subscribe, you may "opt-out" – that is, you may direct us not to make these disclosures across additional product lines within inContact. Your decision to opt-out will not affect the provision of any services to which you currently subscribe. IF WE DO NOT HEAR FROM YOU WITHIN 33 DAYS OF THE MAILING DATE OF THIS NOTIFICATION, WE WILL ASSUME THAT YOU APPROVE OUR USE OF YOUR CPNI FOR THE PURPOSES OF PROVIDING YOU WITH INFORMATION ABOUT OUR OTHER COMMUNICATIONS-RELATED SERVICES. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO DISAPPROVE OUR USE OF YOUR CPNI AND MAY DENY OR WITHDRAW OUR RIGHT TO USE YOUR CPNI AT ANY TIME. Your approval or denial of approval for the use of CPNI is valid until such time as your telephone services are discontinued or you affirmatively revoke or limit such approval or denial. If you have previously opted-out, you do not need to respond to this notice in order to maintain your current opt-out status. However, if you opt-out now, or maintain opt-out status, inContact’s ability to offer you certain services to which you do not currently subscribe, including promotions and cost-saving bundled services, may be limited.
