<h1>ECFMG<sup><small>®</small></sup> Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>The Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates ("ECFMG") shares your concerns for maintaining the integrity and privacy of personal information collected on the Internet. ECFMG is committed to protecting your privacy, and the following Privacy Policy ("Policy") is intended to explain our information collection and dissemination practices in connection with the <a href="../index.html">www.ecfmg.org</a> web site (the "Site"). Please review the entire Policy and feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@ecfmg.org">webmaster@ecfmg.org</a> if you have any questions. For privacy practices specific to the Step 2 Clinical Skills (CS) Calendar and Scheduling Web Site, please see this site's <a href="2csusagr.html">User Agreement</a>. </p>

<p>1) <b>Collection of Personal Information from Site Users</b> </p>

<p>While visiting our Site, you may choose to provide personal information to us in the process of completing various on-line forms for participation in ECFMG's programs and services for international medical students/graduates, international medical schools, U.S. medical licensing authorities, U.S. graduate medical education programs, credentialing agencies, and others. This information may include, but is not limited to, your name, date of birth, e-mail address, postal address, telephone number, credit card information, social security and/or national identification numbers, country of birth, citizenship, family status, employment information and information related to your medical education, training, and licensure. You may also choose to provide personal information to us in the process of filling out an on-line application for employment with ECFMG. This information may include, but is not limited to, your name, e-mail address, postal address, telephone number, employment history, and list of references. By providing your personal information on-line, you consent to allow ECFMG to use that information in accordance with this Policy. </p> 

<p>In general, applicants for participation in ECFMG’s programs and services and applicants for employment with ECFMG are required to respond to all of the questions on our application forms. During the course of applying for ECFMG Certification, applicants may be asked about their ethnicity. Applicants for Certification, however, are not required to provide information regarding ethnicity. Providing information regarding your ethnicity is optional and choosing a particular answer or choosing not to provide this information will not affect the outcome of your application for ECFMG Certification. ECFMG uses information about the ethnicity of its applicants for research purposes, and it is kept confidential. Except in cases where ECFMG is recruiting standardized patients to participate in clinical skills exams, ECFMG does not require candidates for employment to provide information regarding ethnicity.</p> 

<p>If, for any reason, you choose not to provide your personal information on-line, you may download certain of our available forms from the Site and mail them to us. To request a single copy of any available publication or form, contact ECFMG by telephone at (215) 386-5900, by fax at (215) 386-9196, or in writing at the address listed below in "Inquiries and Concerns."</p> 

<p>Medical schools that choose not to participate in the ECFMG Medical School Web Portal (EMSWP) for the purpose of verifying the status of their students/graduates who apply to ECFMG for the United States Medical Licensing Examination™ (USMLE™) may continue to use our established paper-based verification process.</p>

<p>Applications for employment with ECFMG, participation in ECFMG’s IMG Advisors Network (IAN), and the ERAS® Return of Document Service (RODS) may not be downloaded from the Site or requested via phone, fax or mail. Such applications must be completed on-line through the Site.</p>

<p>When a User accesses any of the on-line services at the Site, cookies are stored in the User’s browser memory and/or written to the User’s computer. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your computer and allows identification of the User. The cookies are used solely to identify the same user from web page to web page and to indicate, in the case of Users with a user id, that the User has been properly authenticated. Cookies stored in the browser’s memory are removed when the User leaves the Site and the browser is closed. Cookies written to the User’s computer become permanently inaccessible either when the User leaves the Site or after a short, pre-determined time out period has expired. With the exception of the authentication, payment, on-line employment application, On-line Applicant Status and Information System (OASIS), Interactive Web Application (IWA), International Medical Education Directory (IMED), IMED Subscription Service, Step 2 CS Calendar and Scheduling, Certification Verification Service (CVS) ON-LINE, IAN, and EMSWP pages, all non-service web pages are hosted by Verio. For more information regarding Verio's information collection practices, please see Verio's privacy policy at <a href="http://www.verio.com/about/legal/privacy/">www.verio.com/about/legal/privacy/</a>.</p>

<p>2) <b>Security</b></p> 

<p>As part of ECFMG's pledge to protect your privacy, we employ Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology and password protection to portions of the Site to prevent unauthorized access to your personal information. In order to access your personal information, you must first authenticate your identity by entering your user id, password, and, in some cases, answers to challenge questions. All authentication pages are secured by SSL technology. Similarly, as you prepare to pay for your programs and services, you will enter our secure payment web page and will have a limited amount of time to enter the required information. Please note that pages other than the authentication pages, payment pages, on-line employment application, OASIS, IWA, IMED Subscription Service, CVS ON-LINE, IAN, and EMSWP are not secured by SSL or other encryption programs. ECFMG uses third-party vendors, such as VeriSign and TeleCheck, in order to process your on-line payments. Please see VeriSign's Privacy Policy at <a href="http://www.verisign.com/truste/index.html">www.verisign.com/truste/index.html</a> and TeleCheck's Privacy Policy at <a href="http://www.telecheck.com/home/privacy_policy.html">www.telecheck.com/home/privacy_policy.html</a> for more information regarding their security and privacy practices.</p> 

<p>ECFMG utilizes a third-party application called HireTouch owned by ImageTrend Inc. to process its on-line employment applications. Please see ImageTrend Inc.’s Privacy Policy at <a href="https://www.hiretouch.com/privacypolicy">https://www.hiretouch.com/privacypolicy</a> for more information regarding its security and privacy practices.</p>

<p>Please note that, while ECFMG has endeavored to create a secure and reliable site for Users, the confidentiality of any communication transmitted to or from ECFMG via the Site or e-mail cannot be guaranteed. Accordingly, ECFMG is not responsible for the security of information transmitted via the Internet.</p> 

<p>3) <b>Use of Personal Information Collected</b> </p>

<p>ECFMG uses the personal information you provide in order to process your applications and requests for or participation in services and in order to verify that you meet the minimum qualifications for our programs and services or for employment with ECFMG. Additionally, ECFMG may use aggregated personal information for research and statistical purposes. ECFMG does not use your personal information for marketing or promotional purposes. In connection with on-line employment applications, except where you tell ECFMG not to, we will keep the information that you submit for future consideration.</p>  

<p>4) <b>Disclosure of Personal Information to Third Parties</b> </p>

<p>The USMLE is sponsored jointly by the National Board of Medical Examiners® (NBME®) and the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB). In order to ensure an efficient and accurate examination process for applicants for ECFMG Certification, portions of the personal information they provide to us are retained in a database shared by ECFMG, NBME, and FSMB for the purposes of exam registration and scheduling. As a result, if you apply for examination, the NBME and FSMB will have access to your personal information in this capacity. Additionally, this information, as well as performance data from the examination, is used by these organizations for research and statistical purposes, although only in the aggregate.</p> 

<p>Through EMSWP, ECFMG provides international medical schools with access to Status Verification, a web-based program for verifying the status of their students and graduates who apply to ECFMG for the USMLE. If you apply to ECFMG for examination and your medical school participates in EMSWP Status Verification, ECFMG and your medical school will exchange certain information contained in your ECFMG and medical school records, such as your name, USMLE/ECFMG Identification Number, medical school identification number, enrollment status, and examination/eligibility period applied for, via the Internet for the purpose of verifying your status and, thus, your eligibility for examination. If you are a medical school staff member and use EMSWP to verify the status of your medical school’s students/graduates who have applied to ECFMG for examination, your medical school’s EMSWP Coordinator will have access to your EMSWP User Name, and will have access to and be able to request changes to personal information associated with your EMSWP account, including your name, date of birth, birth country, job title, and contact information, including your e-mail address. Additionally, actions that you perform in EMSWP Status Verification will be associated with your name, and other authorized users at your medical school will have access to this information.</p>

<p>Applicants for examination should also note that by signing and submitting the Certification Statement or Certification of Identification Form associated with the USMLE application, you authorize ECFMG to transmit the information contained in your application, or that otherwise may become available to ECFMG, to "any federal, state or local governmental department or agency, to any hospital or to any other organization or individual who, in the judgment of ECFMG, has a legitimate interest in such information." </p>

<p>By participating in IAN as an advisor, you acknowledge that information about yourself that you submit to the IAN database, such as your family status, training institution, and training specialty, and other information from your ECFMG record, such as your name, gender, and medical school, will be available to eligible users of the IAN database. Advisees who select an advisor from the IAN database acknowledge that personal information from their ECFMG record and application for ECFMG J-1 visa sponsorship, including their name, medical school, graduation year, and training specialty and institution, as well as the e-mail address they submit to the IAN database will be sent by e-mail to each advisor they select, unless they choose not to include such information in the e-mail message to the selected advisor.</p>

<p>By requesting return of your ERAS documents via courier shipping through RODS, you acknowledge that ECFMG and FedEx® will exchange information that you submit with your RODS request (such as your mailing address, telephone number, and e-mail address) and information from your ECFMG record (such as your name) that is necessary to process your request.</p>

<p>ECFMG also shares certain information about applicants for ECFMG Certification (e.g., name, ECFMG applicant number and certification status, medical school and/or date of birth) with the American Medical Association (the "AMA") and the Association of American Medical Colleges (the "AAMC"). These organizations use the data that we provide to update and maintain their medical provider databases.</p> 

<p>Other than the instances described for EMSWP Status Verification, the IAN database, RODS requests, the AMA, and the AAMC, or as ECFMG shall notify User of in the future, ECFMG pledges not to sell, rent, offer, or otherwise disclose any personal information, such as names, e-mail addresses, postal addresses, telephone numbers, credit card information, employment history and other personal information that User voluntarily provides to ECFMG, to any organization or individual without such a legitimate interest (collectively "Third Parties"), except to the extent necessary to comply with applicable laws or valid legal processes, or to protect the rights or property of ECFMG. </p>

<p>As noted above, ECFMG uses third-party vendors to process your on-line payment transactions. In order to process these transactions, your payment information must be disclosed to these third parties. You may review VeriSign's Privacy Policy by clicking <a href="http://www.verisign.com/truste/index.html">here</a> and you may review TeleCheck's Privacy Policy by clicking <a href="http://www.telecheck.com/home/privacy_policy.html">here</a>. By paying for your programs and/or services by on-line check, you authorize TeleCheck to obtain a report of your check-writing history in order to prevent fraud and for other authentication purposes. </p>

<p>5) <b>Access and Ability to Correct Personal Data</b> </p>

<p>Using <a href="https://oasis2.ecfmg.org">OASIS</a>, properly identified applicants for ECFMG Certification may access and verify or change such personal information as name of record, postal address, e-mail address, fax number and status of their financial account. You may also check the status of your USMLE applications and score reports, USMLE scheduling permits, and medical education credentials. In order to add to or change information in OASIS, you must have both your USMLE/ECFMG Identification Number and a password. If you do not have a password, you may obtain one by accessing <a href="https://oasis2.ecfmg.org">OASIS</a> and following the instructions for establishing a new account. OASIS is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, with the exception of maintenance periods. </p>

<p>Upon a properly authenticated request via postal mail, ECFMG will provide Users who are applicants for ECFMG Certification access to personal information that cannot be otherwise accessed through OASIS, such as credit card information, social security and/or national identification numbers, which User may then change or update. To request access to your personal information, you may write to us at the address listed below in "Inquiries and Concerns."</p>

<p>Users of EMSWP Status Verification can request changes to their personal information by contacting their medical school’s EMSWP Coordinator. The EMSWP Coordinator can request such changes for all Users at the medical school by accessing EMSWP at <a href="https://emswp.ecfmg.org">https://emswp.ecfmg.org</a>. The medical school’s EMSWP Coordinator can also request such changes by contacting ECFMG’s EMSWP Administrator by e-mail at <a href="mailto:emswpadmin@ecfmg.org">emswpadmin@ecfmg.org</a>. ECFMG’s EMSWP Administrator will review these requests and, if approved, implement the requested changes.</p>
