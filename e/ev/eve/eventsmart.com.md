# Privacy Policy - Event Smart

_Your privacy is critically important to us. At Event Smart we have a few fundamental principles:_

  * We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)
  * We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
  * We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.
  * We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.



If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our support team.

Event Espresso, LLC. (“ **Event Espresso** ” and “ **Event Smart** ”) operates several websites including EventEspresso.com and EventSmart.com. It is Event Espresso’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

**Website Visitors**

Like most website operators, Event Smart collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Event Smart’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Event Smart’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Event Smart may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Event Smart also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on EventSmart.com sites. Event Smart only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that site commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the site where the comment was left.

**Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information**

Certain visitors to Event Smart’s websites choose to interact with Event Smart in ways that require Event Smart to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Event Smart gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for services at EventSmart.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Event Smart – by purchasing – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Event Smart collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Event Smart. Event Smart does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

**Aggregated Statistics**

Event Smart may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Event Smart may monitor the most popular sites on the EventSmart.com site or use spam screened by the Akismet service to help identify spam. Event Smart may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Event Smart does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

**Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information**

Event Smart discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Event Smart’s behalf or to provide services available at Event Smart’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Event Smart’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Event Smart will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Event Smart discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Event Smart believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Event Smart, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user (including attendees) of an Event Smart website and have supplied your email address, Event Smart may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Event Smart and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Event Smart takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying information.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Event Smart uses cookies to help Event Smart identify and track visitors, their usage of Event Smart website, and their website access preferences. Event Smart visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Event Smart’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Event Smart’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

**Business Transfers**

If Event Smart, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Event Smart goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Event Smart may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

**Ads**

Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Event Smart and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

**Comments**

Comments and other content submitted to our Akismet anti-spam service are not saved on our servers unless they were marked as false positives, in which case we store them long enough to use them to improve the service to avoid future false positives.

**Identity**

From time to time we may use your name or logo in promoting you and the Event Smart service. We do not intend any harm, in fact we hope as we give you exposure it helps you and your brand. If you have issue with this please [contact us](https://eventsmart.com/contact/).

**Privacy Policy Changes**

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Event Smart may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Event Smart’s sole discretion. Event Smart encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a EventSmart.com account, you should also check your site’s dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
