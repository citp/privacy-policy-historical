 **Disclosure.** We don’t sell or rent users’ personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without users' explicit consent.

You may not use our site or communication tools to harvest addresses, send spam or otherwise breach our Terms of Use or Privacy Policy. We may automatically scan and manually filter email messages sent via our communication tools for malicious activity or prohibited content, but we do not permanently store such messages.

 **Access, Modification, and Deletion.** You can see, modify or erase most of your personal information by reviewing and modifying your posting or account status page, by signing on to "My Events King," or by contacting customer support ([privacy@EventsKing.com](mailto:eventsking@gmail.com)) to review any personal information we store that is not available on Events King. There may be a charge associated with such requests but these will not exceed the amounts permitted by law. We delete personal information when we no longer need it for the purposes we described earlier. We retain personal information as permitted by law to resolve disputes, enforce our policies, and prevent bad guys from coming back.

**Transfer of Personal Data to Other Countries..** We may share your information with members of the eBay Inc. corporate family - like eBay or PayPal - to provide joint content and services (like registration, transactions and customer support), to help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts and violations of our policies, and to guide decisions about their products, services and communications. Members of our corporate family will use this information to send you marketing communications only if you've requested their services.

**Security.** We use lots of tools (encryption, passwords, physical security) to protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure, but as you probably know, nothing’s perfect, so we make no guarantees.

**General.** We may update this policy at any time, with updates taking effect when you next use the site or after 30 days, whichever is sooner. If we or our corporate affiliates are involved in a merger or acquisition, we may share personal information with another company, but this policy will continue to apply.
