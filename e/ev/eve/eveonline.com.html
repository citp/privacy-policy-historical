This includes information provided at the time of registering to use our site, subscribing to our service, posting material or requesting further services. We may also ask you for information when you enter a competition or promotion sponsored by our business partners and when you report a problem with our site.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>We may also ask you to complete surveys that we use for research purposes, although you do not have to respond to them.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Details of transactions you carry out through our site and of the fulfilment of your orders. Details of your visits to our site including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data, whether this is required for our own billing purposes or otherwise and the resources that you access.  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
		For some activities, we may ask you to create a username and password and/or to provide other, non-personal information such as your age, date of birth, gender, and/or game and platform preferences; and, combine such information with your personal information. In addition, your web browser or client software may transmit certain geographic information or information regarding your computer (capabilities, game data processing, etc.) to CCP. We may use this information to generate aggregate statistics about our user community and may provide such non-personal information to advertisers and/or our partners. In addition, CCP may use such information for security, system integrity (the prevention of hacking, cheats, etc.), or enforcement purposes. 
	</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p>To estimate our audience size and usage pattern.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>To store information about your preferences, and so allow us to customise our site according to your individual interests.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>To speed up your searches.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>To recognise you when you return to our site. </p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our site. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you log on to our site.</p>


<p><b>WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA</b></p>

<p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.
All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk.
