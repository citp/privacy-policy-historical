(a) Volunteered Information: We will accept and store any information you enter on the Web Site or give us in any other way that personally identifies you, securely and safely.  We use that information to improve your experience on the Web Site, to get a better general understanding of the type of individuals visiting the Web Site, and to enable us to contact you when needed. Typically you will provide information such as name, email address, postal address, birth date, gender, and due date/baby’s birth date.  This information is used to customize your experience, suggest friends, and provide unique, personalized content just for you.  By submitting this personally identifiable information to EverydayFamily.com, we may disclose Private Information about you with third parties and you agree to receive email and postal mail communication from EverydayFamily and third parties. We are able to offer all of the great content, sweepstakes, samples and coupons on the site by your willingness to accept this communication. This privacy policy applies to users who register on www.EverydayFamily.com or on the websites of our media partners. We believe in 100% permission based marketing. Members always have the option to unsubscribe from these emails by clicking on the unsubscribe link contained in every email sent. Members also have the option of completely removing their information from our database by sending the request to [memberservices@EverydayFamily.com](mailto:memberservices@EverydayFamily.com).

You can always choose not to provide certain information to us, however, you will not be able to take advantage of many of our offers and exciting site features. If you have previously provided certain information to us and you desire to remove such information from our databases, or if you do not wish for your information to be disclosed to third parties, you may contact us at [memberservices@EverydayFamily.com](mailto:memberservices@EverydayFamily.com) to remove such information. If you have requested that this information be sent to third parties for the fulfillment of offers or any other reason, you will have to contact the third party directly to remove or modify your information. We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as our email service. These companies are authorized to use your personal information  _only as necessary_  to provide these services to us.

(b) Automatic Information / Login: To enable us to provide content that users need and desire, we collect aggregated site-visitation statistics using cookies. A Cookie is simply a small data file we place on your computer’s hard drive when you first visit the Web Site (“Cookie”). This file contains an encrypted unique number that helps us identify you when you return to the Web Site. Cookies are employed by thousands of web sites to enhance users’ web viewing experience. Cookies can neither damage user files nor can they read information from users’ hard drives. Allowing us to create a Cookie on your hard drive will not give us or any other site access to the rest of your computer’s hard drive, and only we will be able to read the Cookie that the Web Site creates. Certain features of EverydayFamily.com may not work without use of automatic information collection technologies. Information collected by these technologies cannot be used to identify you without additional identifiable information.

We may also use cookies, pixels, web beacons (which are usually small, transparent graphic images), operating system and device information and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit, the features and information for which you searched and viewed, the email you opened, or on which advertisements you clicked. This type of information is collected to make the Site more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs.

The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.

We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.

An “Internet protocol address” or “IP Address” is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. We, or our service providers, may use your IP Address when you access the Site or use other means to assist with delivering geographically targeted advertisements.

Most web browsers automatically accept Cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block Cookies in the future. The “Help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will explain how you can prevent your browser from accepting new Cookies, how to set the browser to inform you when you receive a new Cookie, or how to reject Cookies altogether.

(c) Third-Party Information: We may also combine online and/or offline information received from third parties with the information we have already collected from you via our Site. The third party information is used for a variety of purposes including to verify other information about you (e.g., verify your mailing address to send you requested products or services) and to enhance the content and advertising we provide to you.

(d) Social Networking: You can modify your privacy settings within your My Account screen on the site. By selecting the “Community Preferences” link you can select who can see your profile information and your public messages. If you would like to have an unauthorized profile removed, you can contact us at [memberservices@everydayfamily.com](mailto:memberservices@everydayfamily.com) and we will delete the profile from our records.

(e) Behavioral Advertising: We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please see: <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>

(f) Display Advertising: We utilize Google Analytics for Display Advertising, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, and Demographics and Interests reporting, including Remarketing to advertise online.  This allows third-party vendors, including Google, to show our ads on sites across the internet.  We use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together, to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on someones’s past visits to our website.  These cookies also report ad impressions, interactions with ad services and basic demographic information, such as age, gender and interests.  You can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using [Ads Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/ads).
