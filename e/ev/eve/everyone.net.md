**Our Commitment To Privacy**

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. 

**The Information We Collect**

This notice applies to all information collected on the Everyone.net web site, or submitted to Everyone.net at any time through any web pages which we host.

Personally Identifiable Information - When visiting Everyone.net's or any Partner's web site and signing up for or using Everyone.net services through a web page hosted by us, you may choose to supply Everyone.net with information that identifies you personally. For **end-users** , this information may include your name and contact information, gender, age group, occupation & industry, and user comments and opt-in preference; we intend to collect shipping and billing information, which may, in the future, include credit card numbers, and other payment types of information. We also intend to collect behavior patterns, which may include recording frequency of use of our services, which and when items were purchased, at which site and page, and other information related to behavior patterns. We collect **prospect information** , which may include name, and contact information of individual(s) you think would be interested in our services. For **Partners** , the information we collect may include your name and contact information, your site's category, your web site information (URL, visitors per day, description of services offered at web site), and user comments.

When Partners add our services to their web site, end-user information collected is stored in our database. Thus, our database has information collected on our site as well as on Partner sites. As stated in the Partner and End-User agreements, Everyone.net and each Partner both have access to the information specific to their site only; individual Partners do not have the ability to access information about end-users from other Partner sites. The information Everyone.net collects will be used as stated below. **As for each of our Partners** , they will determine what they will do with the information collected, while each have individually agreed to abide by this Privacy Policy, the Everyone.net [Partner Agreement](https://web.archive.org/web/20000622065214id_/http%3A//www.everyone.net/main/html/agreement_partner.html) and [End-User Agreement](https://web.archive.org/web/20000622065214id_/http%3A//www.everyone.net/main/html/agreement_enduser.html).

**Collection of Personal Information from Children under Thirteen**

Everyone.net does not allow Partners to collect information from children under the age of thirteen (13), unless Everyone.net makes a special exception because the Partner Site complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) or the COPPA rule issued by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). A copy of the COPPA rule issued by the FTC is available at [http://www.ftc.gov/os/1999/9910/64fr59888.pdf ](http://www.ftc.gov/os/1999/9910/64fr59888.pdf)In order to comply with COPPA and the COPPA rule issued by the FTC, the Partner must obtain consent from the parents, or legal guardians, of children under the age of 13 in order to keep or use any personally identifiable information collected from the child and allow parents, and legal guardians, to change or revoke consent at any time. Any personal information collected from children under 13 must comply with this Privacy Policy.  **The Way We Use Information**

We use the information you provide about yourself or others to complete the transaction for which it is intended. This may include administering a service such as email, search, community, e-commerce, etc., completing an order, shipping a product, or contacting you if you have indicated your permission to do so. We do not share this information with outside parties without your permission except to the extent that is necessary to administer the services we offer our Partners and end-users.

When we receive email addresses, through support, or get messages posted on our support forum, we use the return email addresses to reply with the information requested. For email addresses we receive through our "Keep Me Posted" program on our web site, we email service announcements and updates as requested. Support and "Keep Me Posted" addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.

For **end-users** , when supplying name and contact information, shipping information, prospect information, and user comments to Everyone.net, we will use it to answer your questions, ship your products, or provide you with the requested services. When supplying name and contact information to Everyone.net, you can indicate your preference whether you would like to be contacted to receive information and updates about Everyone.net's or Partner's services, or special offers from other companies through the Everyone.Benefits!™ program. 

In addition, when indicating your age, gender, occupation & industry, and contact information, we will extract non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our web site and services, and to share the aggregate data with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our web site, or that Y number of men and Z number of women use a certain service. Everyone.net services may also utilize personally identifiable end-user information to provide targeted content and commerce opportunities to end-users based on their demographic and behavioral information. Also, we may use this information to gather aggregate behavioral patterns such as frequency of use of our services, interests, types of items purchased, how many items purchased, etc., to administer and improve our services accordingly.

For **Partners** , when supplying name and contact information, site's category, web site information (such as URL address, visitors per day, description of services offered at web site), and user comments, we will put this into aggregate information so we can categorize and understand the types of web sites that use our services, and also to administer our services. Also, we will use this information to respond to your requests as well as to contact you for general business purposes. For example, if you forget your account information, we will use this information to verify you are the account holder.

For **prospects** , when getting information about you, we will use the information for which it was intended or submitted. You have the right to access and correct information submitted about you, receive the same courteous and professional treatment and services as our end-users and Partners. 

Finally, for **end-users, Partners,** and **prospects** , we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above, without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out, or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. 

**Conditional Access Area-Control Center**

Everyone.net maintains an area called the "Control Center" which is a tool that allows you to administer the services you set up through Everyone.net. To access the Control Center, you will need to enter an account ID and password. In order to sign up for an account, you will need to provide your name and contact information, your site's category, your web site information (URL, visitors per day, description of services offered at web site), etc.

 **Online Support Forum**

When using the online "Support" forum of our web site to post your questions and/or comments, you will be asked to indicate your name, email address, and message. When posting your message, your name, email address, and message are publicly displayed and available to anyone who may visit those pages. 

**Our Commitment to Data Security**

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures reasonably designed to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. 

The Control Center and end-user accounts have SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption to secure personal identification. In addition, personnel who have access to our database are trained to maintain and secure all information. 

Everyone.net has teamed up with Above.net to provide a faster Internet connection from our servers. As a result, our servers are now co-located at Above.net's facility. Above.net does not have the ability to access our servers or any information stored in our servers. Also, our servers are secured in a locked and alarmed facility to protect all our equipment and data. 

**How You Can Access or Correct Your Information**

For **Partners** , you can access all your personally identifiable information that Everyone.net collects online and maintains by logging into your password-protected (SSL encrypted) account at [http://www.everyone.net](http://www.everyone.net/) and selecting to update your "Profile." For **end-users** , you can access your information by logging into your password-protected end-user account and selecting to update your "Personal Info." We use this procedure to better safeguard your information. You can also correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows error.

If you do not currently have an account with us, and have submitted information on our site, you can access and correct the information that we maintain by contacting us. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
