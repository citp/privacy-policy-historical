# Privacy Policy — Ever

## Ever Co. Privacy Policy

 **Last Modified: November 1st, 2016**

Your privacy is of the utmost importance to us. For this reason, Ever Co. focuses on providing the best service to you while keeping your information as private as possible.

This Privacy Policy provides our policies and procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing your information. Users can access the Ever Co. service (the "Service") through our website www.ever.com, our applications on Devices, through APIs, and through third-parties. A "Device" is any computer used to access the Ever Service, including without limitation a desktop, laptop, mobile phone, tablet, or other consumer electronic device. This Privacy Policy governs your access of the Ever Service, regardless of how you access it, and by using our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Policy.

### Information Collection & Use Practices

We may collect and store the following personal information when running the Ever Service:

 _ **Information You Provide**_. When you register an account, we collect some personal information, such as your name, phone number, credit card or other billing information, email address and home and business postal addresses. You may provide us with your contacts' email addresses, phone numbers, or other contact information when sharing folders or files with them through the Service. We may also receive Personal Information (including, for example, your email address or phone number) through other users, for example if they have tried to share something with you or tried to refer Ever to you.

 _ **Files and Content.**_  We collect and store the files you upload, download, or access with the Ever Service ("Files"). If you add a file to your Ever that has been previously uploaded by you or another user, we may associate all or a portion of the previous file with your account rather than storing a duplicate. When you share photos, videos or other content to the Service, we will also collect information about the content, such as the time, date and location the photo or content was taken or uploaded, (also known as metadata), and how you use them, who views them or with whom you share. 

 _ **Address Book Information.**_  With your permission, Ever may access your contact list available on your mobile device or in your email accounts so that you may share files or folders with your friends, or invite others to join the Ever Service. When you invite others to join Ever by using our referral page, we send a one-time text message on your behalf to that referral. You may share files or folders with friends from the Service by a variety of ways, including via text or email (sent by Ever or by your native device program), on social media or messaging services. We do not use your contact list information for any purpose other than to send invitations or messages on your behalf and with your explicit consent. We also do not store your address book information on our servers.

 _ **Third Party Site Information.**_   When you connect Ever to your social media accounts or third party sites or services, such as Facebook, Instagram, Amazon, Dropbox and others, we may receive information from those services including your profile information, photos and videos, friends and contact lists, user name, user ID associated with your third party account, age range, language, country, and any other information you permit the social network to share with third parties. The data we receive is dependent upon your privacy settings with the third party site or social network, and we will not post information about you on third party social media sites without your consent. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to our Service.  

We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service, as well as to communicate directly with you, such as to send you email messages and push notifications, and permit you to communicate with others on the Service or on social media or invite others to join the Service.  We may also use information about your activities on the Service to provide personalized content, including targeted advertising.  We may also send you Service-related emails or messages (e.g., account verification, change or updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices).  For more information about your communication preferences, see “Your Choices Regarding Your Information” below.

Although we do our best to honor the privacy preferences of our users, we are not able to respond to Do Not Track signals from your browser at this time. 

### Information Sharing

 _ **Your Use.  **_We will display your Personal Information in your profile page and elsewhere on the Service according to the preferences you set in your account.
