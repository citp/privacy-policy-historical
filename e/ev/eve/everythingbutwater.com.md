# Privacy Statement | Everything But Water

##  Effective: May 25, 2018

##  Collection and Use of Information

It is Orlando Bathing Suit, LLC's ( **"OBS", "we", "us"** or **"our"** ) policy to respect the privacy of visitors to Everything But Water's website(s) at [www.everythingbutwater.com](https://www.everythingbutwater.com/), including the mobile versions of such website (collectively ( **"Websites"** ). We have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe to you our practices regarding the personal information we collect from users of our Websites.

OBS will collect personal information such as names, home addresses, phone number, e-mail addresses, birth month and date, credit card and other billing information, and shipping information, etc., but only when a visitor of our Websites voluntarily gives it to us in the process of subscribing to OBS promotional emails, postal mail, and phone calls (e.g., to call you when new items from your favorite designer become available) (see the Communications section below for more details), placing orders on our Websites, or registering for an account with OBS ( **"Account"** ). If you contact us via e-mail (including customer service), we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply. OBS may request feedback from visitors of our Websites. Feedback is used for internal purposes only, and any personally identifiable information that may be submitted is deleted. When you participate in one of our surveys, we may collect additional profile information. When you participate in contests, sweepstakes, or other similar activities ( **"Sweepstakes"** ) that we make available on our Websites, which may be facilitated via a third party partner and/or conducted in partnership with a third party partner ( **"Sweepstakes Partner"** ), we will collect the information designated along with such Sweepstakes. We may also receive information about you through third party companies that we partner with. You might also provide OBS with the personal information of other persons, such as family or friends to whom you ship purchases. Such information may include their name, shipping address, and email address.

We may also collect information from you via technology as described in the Information Collected via Technology section below.

This information is used by OBS for the following purposes: to identify you as a user, create and manage your Account, place and manage your order, fulfill or respond to your other requests, administer Sweepstakes, improve our products and services, send you service related communications via emails, postal mail, or phone calls, send you promotional communications via emails, postal mail, or phone calls (see the Communications section below for more details), and for our marketing and research purposes.

##  Disclosure of Information

**California Users: Your California Privacy Rights.** California's "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the businesses' practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information sharing. We have such a policy in place. This section and the section titled "Correspondence" explains our practices and how you can opt-out of having your information shared to third parties for the third parties' direct or indirect marketing purposes, in accordance with such laws. In addition to reviewing this section and the section titled "Correspondence", if you wish to find out about any rights you may have under California Civil Code section 1798.83, you may notify us in writing at [privacy@everythingbutwater.com](mailto:privacy@everythingbutwater.com).

OBS will not sell, rent or otherwise transmit a visitor's personal information to any third party except as described in this Privacy Policy. OBS may disclose your personal information: (a) if OBS asks for and receives your permission to do so at the time the personal information is collected; (b) to our third party services providers (e.g., payment processors), who are required not to use your personal information other than to provide the services requested by OBS; (c) if you participate in a Sweepstakes, to the Sweepstakes Partner to process the Sweepstakes; (d) where OBS has reason to believe that disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference (whether intentionally or unintentionally) with OBS's rights or property or anyone else who may be harmed by such actions; (e) if required by law or respond to subpoenas or warrants; and/or (f) to investigate any violation or potential violation of the law, this Privacy Policy, or the Terms and Conditions. If another company acquires our company, business, or our assets, including through bankruptcy, that company will possess the personal information collected by it and us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. We may also share your information to third parties (including Sweepstakes Partners) for the third parties' direct or indirect marketing purposes as described in the section titled "Correspondence" below.

We may create anonymous information from personal information by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the data personally identifiable to you. OBS may share anonymous information about the visitors of our Website with our advertisers, business partners, sponsors and certain others. Anonymous information is also used to develop, improve and customize our Websites to better serve visitors to our Websites. OBS reserves the right to use anonymous information for any purpose and disclose anonymous information to third parties in its sole discretion.

##  For Children Under 16

We do not intentionally gather personal information about visitors who are under the age of 16. If a child under 16 submits personal information to OBS and we learn that the personal information is the information of a child under 16, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible.  If you believe that we might have any personal information from a child under 16, please contact us at [privacy@everythingbutwater.com](mailto:privacy@everythingbutwater.com).

##  For Outside of the United States

Your personal information may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of personal information may be less stringent than the laws in your country. If you are a non U.S. user of the Websites, by visiting the Websites and/or providing us with information, you acknowledge and agree that your personal information may be processed for the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy. By providing your information, you consent to such transfer.

##  Correspondence

**OBS Correspondence.** OBS uses automated systems to provide promotional correspondence and to collect and answer correspondence from visitors of our Websites. If you decide to opt in to our promotional email, postal mail or phone lists, you will receive promotional e-mails, postal mail, and phone calls, such as company news, updates, product or service information, promotions and special offers, style emails, etc. However, you may opt out (unsubscribe) of promotional emails at any time by clicking the unsubscribe button at the bottom of all e-mails that you will receive from us and you may opt out (unsubscribe) of promotional postal mail at any time by emailing us at [customerservice@everythingbutwater.com](mailto:customerservice@everythingbutwater.com). If you opt out, we may still send you non-marketing emails. Non-marketing emails include emails about your Account and our business dealings with you.

**Third Party Correspondence.** If you decide to opt in to receive third party marketing, from time to time we may disclose your contact information to third parties to allow them to market their products or services to you or for other marketing purposes. By entering into a Sweepstakes, you are opting in to receive marketing from the third party Sweepstakes partner, unless the Sweepstakes includes an active opt-in or opt-out option, in which case your election applies. If you want us to stop further sharing your contact information with third parties (including new third parties), you must notify us at [donotshare@everythingbutwater.com](mailto:donotshare@everythingbutwater.com). Please follow the instructions provided to you by third parties that we've already shared with to unsubscribe from their messages.

**Exceptions.** If you have opted-out as described above, and thereafter you elect to use a service or promotion that requires us to contact you or share your information with a third party (e.g., enter into a Sweepstakes as described above or otherwise opting in to receive third party marketing), then your previous opt-out preferences will not apply to such service. Despite your indicated preferences, we may provide you service related communication, including emails, postal mails, and phone calls regarding your purchases and notices of any updates to our Terms of Use or Privacy Policy.
