# Privacy Policy - Eventsforce

We at Eventsforce (Eventsforce Inc., Eventsforce Ltd. and our affiliates) are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy applies to both our websites (Websites), including www.eventsforce.com, and the Eventsforce application (the Application). This Privacy Policy governs our data collection, processing and usage practices. By using the Websites or the Application, you consent to the data practices described in this Privacy Policy.  If you do not agree with the data practices described in this Privacy Policy, you should not use the Websites or the Application.

We periodically update this Privacy Policy. If you subscribe to the Application, then you will receive notice when this Privacy Policy is modified. The notice will be delivered as a “user message” app in the Eventsforce admin portal. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.

Eventsforce complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.

## **1.1. Changes to this Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time by posting a new version online. You should check this page occasionally to review any changes. If we make any material changes we will notify you by posting the revised Privacy Policy on our Websites and, if you subscribe to the Application, providing notice through a “user message” in the Eventsforce admin portal. This helps you to always be aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances, if any, it is disclosed. Your continued use of the Websites, the Application, and/or continued provision of Personal Information to us will be subject to the terms of the then-current Privacy Policy.

## **1.2. Contact Us**

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our treatment of the information you provide us, please write to us by email at [support@eventsforce.com](mailto:support@eventsforce.com) or by mail to Eventsforce, The Wenlock, 50-52 Wharf Road, London, N1 7EU, UK.

## **2.1. The Eventsforce Application**

Our online Application allows any company that uses it (our customers and Eventsforce itself) to build event microsites and manage events. This can include collecting contact information and other demographic information from visitors who are participating in events. Eventsforce provides the Application to our customers to manage their events, and we use it to run our own events.

## **2.2. Use by Eventsforce**

We use our own Application to manage our own events. Information that we collect and manage using the Application for our own events belongs to us and is used, disclosed and protected according to this Privacy Policy.

## **2.3. Use by Our Customers**

Our customers use the Application to build event microsites and manage events. Eventsforce does not control the content of event microsites or the types of information that our customers may choose to collect or manage using the Application. That information belongs to them and is used, disclosed and protected by them according to their privacy policies and is not subject to this Privacy Policy. Eventsforce processes our customers’ information as they direct and in accordance with our agreements with our customers, and we store it on our service providers’ servers, but we do not have control over its collection or management. Our agreements with our customers prohibit us from using that information, except as necessary to provide and improve the Application, as permitted by this Privacy Policy, and as required by law. We have no direct relationship with individuals who provide Personal Information to our customers. Our customers control and are responsible for correcting, deleting or updating information they have collected from you using the Application.  We may work with our customers to help them provide notice to their visitors about their data collection, processing and usage. We are not responsible for our customers’ use of information they collect on the Subscription Service.

In addition, we may share data with trusted partners to contact you based on your request to receive such communications, help us perform statistical analysis, or provide customer support.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to these features.  Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy and other policies of the companies providing them.

## **4.10. External Websites**

## **4.11. Public Forums**

We offer publicly accessible message boards, blogs, and community forums.

If you provide information to our customers as part of their use of the Application, our customers decide how long to retain the personal information they collect from you. If a customer terminates its use of the Application, then we will provide customer with access to all information stored for the customer by the Application, including any Personal Information provided by you, for export by the customer according to our agreement with our customer. After termination, we may, unless legally prohibited, delete all customer information, including your Personal Information, from the Application.

## **5.1. Cookies**

We use “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web server. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize pages on our Websites, or use the Application, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. When you return to the same Website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the customized features.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Eventsforce Application or Websites you visit. Eventsforce keeps track of the Websites and pages you visit within Eventsforce, in order to determine what portion of the Eventsforce Website or Application is the most popular or most used. This data is used to deliver customized content and promotions within the Eventsforce Website and Application to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.

## **5.2. Log Files**

We may collect demographic information, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites using log files that are not associated with your name or other personally identifying information. There is also information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by us. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used by Eventsforce for the operation of the Application, to maintain quality of the Application, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the Eventsforce Website. For these purposes, we may link this automatically-collected data to Personal Information such as name, email address, address, and phone number.

## **5.3. Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)**

We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage the Website and Subscription Service by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages or in emails and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.  This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs in emails to our customers’ Personal Information. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see “Opting Out and Unsubscribing”.

## **5.4. Navigational Information Collected by Our Customers**

Our customers can use the tools we provide, as well as tools provided by third parties, to collect Navigational Information when you visit their webpages on the Application. Eventsforce does not control our customers’ use of these tools, nor do we control the information they collect or how they use it.

## **5.5. Flash Cookies and Other Third Party Tracking Technologies**

The Adobe Flash Player (and similar applications) use technology to remember settings, preferences and usage similar to browser cookies but these are managed through a different interface than the one provided by your Web browser. This technology creates locally stored objects that are often referred to as “Flash cookies.” Eventsforce does not use Flash cookies.  However, our customers of our software platform may create pages on the Eventsforce platform that employ Adobe Flash cookies.  Eventsforce does not have access or control over our customers’ Flash cookies, but you may access your Flash management tools from Adobe’s web site directly.   Similarly, our customers may create pages using the Eventsforce Application that use technology from tracking utility companies, such as cookies and web beacons.   The use of these technologies by our customers is not covered by our privacy statement.  We do not have access or control over these third party tracking technologies.

## **5.6. Third Party Tracking Technologies**

The use of cookies and web beacons by any tracking utility company is not covered by our privacy statement.  We do not have access or control over these third party tracking technologies
