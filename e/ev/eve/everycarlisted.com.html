	<div class="col-md-12 sansBold font14 margin-top-20">What information does This Website gather?</div>
		<div class="col-md-12">
			<p>When you visit This Website, EveryCarListed may collect the following types of information:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Personally Identifiable Information You Knowingly Provide</li>
				<li>Information EveryCarListed Collects Automatically</li>
				<li>Non-Personally Identifiable Information You Knowingly Provide</li>
			</ul>
			<p><u>Personally Identifiable Information You Knowingly Provide.</u> EveryCarListed collects personally identifiable information that you knowingly provide to us. For example, EveryCarListed may ask you to provide personally identifiable contact information (such as name, address, e-mail address and telephone number). If you purchase a product or service, EveryCarListed may ask you to provide additional information such as your credit card information. If you request information relating to the sale or purchase of a vehicle on This Website, we may ask you to provide personally identifiable contact information and information relating to the vehicle. Finally, in some cases (for example, if you register with us or sign-in on This Website or purchase a product or service) EveryCarListed may also ask you to provide other information such as a personal ID, password, security question and answer, and birthday.</p>
			<p>If you choose to use an available referral service on This Website (e.g., to send a postcard, listing, page link, contest invitation, etc.), 
			we will ask for certain personal information from the recipient (e.g., the recipient's name, e-mail address, mobile telephone number) 
			and your name and e-mail address. EveryCarListed uses the personally identifiable referral information you provide to facilitate this 
			communication on a one-time basis, and may also store and use such personally identifiable information for analysis purposes 
			(e.g., tracking the success of the referral feature).</p>
			<p>You are responsible for the accuracy and completeness of all personally identifiable information that you knowingly provide.</p>
			<p><u>Information Automatically Collected.</u> In addition, as you (and other users) browse This Website, our web servers, and non "EveryCarListed Family" 
			companies with which EveryCarListed has an agreement may, automatically collect and track certain information about such visits, usually through 
			the use of browser cookies, JavaScript files and tagging, web 
			address tracking codes, file impression counts, "web beacons", and the analysis 
			of http headers ("Tracking Methods"). These Tracking Methods provide information such as the user's IP address, the user's domain name, 
			the user's browser type, the user's user agent, how many users visit This Website, which pages the user visits and for how long, 
			the date and time the user accesses This Website, the Internet address of the site from which the user directly linked to This Website and the 
			links on This Website on which the user clicks. In addition, EveryCarListed may collect certain search parameters relating to searches 
			conducted by the user which are not entered by the user.</p>
			<p><u>Non-Personally Identifiable Information You Knowingly Provide.</u> In some cases, we may also collect non-personally identifiable 
			information that you provide, such as search parameters in connection with a search you conduct through This Website, 
			ratings and reviews, and zip code.</p>
			<p>To improve the services we can offer you, we may decide to expand This Website's capabilities for obtaining information about users in the 
			future. We will update this Privacy Policy as our practices change to ensure that you are aware of developments in this area.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="col-md-12 sansBold font14 margin-top-20">How does EveryCarListed use information collected on This Website?</div>
	<div class="col-md-12">
			<p><u>Specific Purpose.</u> When users supply personally identifiable information about themselves for a specific purpose (for example, to register 
			to use a feature on This Website, to purchase a product or service, to obtain a free listing, to register for a program or to use a feature 
			of a program, to receive information, or to apply for a job), we may use such information for such purpose.</p>
			<p><u>Similar to Information Collected in Traditional Non-Electronic Manner.</u> We also may use personally identifiable information users provide as 
			we would use the same information obtained in a traditional non-electronic manner. For example, we may use such personally identifiable 
			information to assess your credit rating, to publish your name, address, and phone number in our directories (unless you have requested 
			a non-published number), to contact you in connection with a program you are participating in, user reviews and/or to evaluate your service 
			needs, and to contact you regarding additional services you may find useful. When users provide personally identifiable information in 
			connection with a feature on This Website, we may also use such personally identifiable information in connection with the operation of 
			such feature. (For example, if you register to use the personalized directory service, we may use the personally identifiable information 
			you provide to provide you with a more personalized and useful service, and if you create a review of a business on This Website, we may 
			publish your initials, city and state in connection with such review.) When users provide personally identifiable information in connection 
			with a contest, sweepstakes or other promotion that we may run on This Website, we may use such information to administer such contest, 
			sweepstakes or promotion and to notify winners.</p>
			<p><u>Communicate with You.</u> We may also use personally identifiable information you provide or that is automatically collected to communicate with you 
			(e.g., to send you e-mails) and to otherwise serve you. For example, we may use your name and e-mail address to send you e-mails to (a) provide information 
			regarding our company, marketing information about our products and services or the products and services of other companies, and newsletters, (b) conduct 
			online surveys, (c) confirm your registration on This Website, a service registration, or orders placed online and (d) otherwise communicate with you. 
			However, you may request not to receive (i.e., "opt-out" of receiving) commercial e-mail messages (the primary purpose of which is the commercial advertisement 
			or promotion of a commercial product or service) from us (on a category-by-category basis), by clicking on Update Your Email Preferences (or otherwise visiting 
			the e-mail campaign opt-out page), and following the directions provided on the e-mail campaign opt-out page. If you have previously opted out of receiving 
			commercial e-mail messages related to one or more categories, you may cancel your request to opt-out of (i.e., consent to receive commercial e-mail messages 
			from us related to) such categories (on a category-by-category basis) by clicking on Update Your Email Preferences (or otherwise visiting the e-mail campaign 
			opt-out page), and following the directions provided on the e-mail campaign opt-out page. Please note that we reserve the right to send certain types of e-mail 
			messages that are not subject to opt-out (see information about e-mails, below) to online users, including those who have opted out of receiving commercial e-mail 
			messages. Your personally identifiable information may also be used by non-"EveryCarListed Family" companies, with which we have agreements, to provide you 
			information about their products and services.</p>
			<p><u>Protect EveryCarListed's Property or Other Rights.</u> In addition, EveryCarListed may use personally identifiable information you provide and information 
			EveryCarListed automatically collects through this website (and may combine personally identifiable information you provide with information EveryCarListed 
			automatically collects through This Website and non-personally identifiable information you knowingly provide) as it deems appropriate to protect its property or 
			other rights (for example, to enforce any policies or contractual provisions regarding use of the "ratings and reviews" feature or the "send a listing" feature).</p>
			<p><u>Improve Website and Targeted Advertising.</u> We use information EveryCarListed automatically collects through This Website to improve This Website, to monitor 
			its performance, to make This Website easier for you and other users to use, to manage features and programs made available through This Website and to provide behavioral 
			tracking data to non-"EveryCarListed Family" companies, with which we have agreements, for the purpose of presenting you with, among other things, targeted advertising on 
			third party websites. For example, EveryCarListed may use information EveryCarListed automatically collects in the ways described in the section entitled "What is a cookie 
			and why does EveryCarListed use them?", below.</p>
		</div>
	<div class="col-md-12 sansBold font14 margin-top-20">Can I review and request changes to personally identifiable information that I provide through registration forms on This Website?</div>
	<div class="col-md-12">
			<p><u>Create and Update Profile.</u> If you use an available capability on This Website to register with us and create a profile, at any time after you register and create 
			a profile, you may review and request changes to any personally identifiable information you provided through the registration form, by viewing and updating your profile within the application.</p>
			<p><u>Opt-Out of Receiving Commercial E-Mail Messages.</u> In addition, (i) you may request not to receive (i.e., "opt-out" of receiving) commercial e-mail messages from us (on a category-by 
			category basis), by clicking on Update Your Email Preferences (or otherwise visiting the e-mail campaign opt-out page), and following the directions provided on the e-mail campaign opt-out page, 
			and (ii) if you have previously opted out of receiving commercial e-mail messages related to one or more categories, you may cancel your request to opt-out of (i.e., consent to receive commercial

			transaction, service or activity that you initiated or requested, (iii) it is to provide a service on behalf of EveryCarListed (for example, EveryCarListed 
			may contract with an entity outside of the "EveryCarListed Family" to send e-mail messages on behalf of EveryCarListed), in which case such non- "EveryCarListed Family" 
			entities are not permitted to use such information for any purpose other than to provide such service, (iv) it is to assess your credit ranking or report your

			case EveryCarListed may disclose, sell and/or otherwise provide personally identifiable information to such entity). If you provide personally identifiable 
			information to us in the context of an event EveryCarListed sponsors on This Website with another company, such as a contest, or if you register on a co-sponsored 
			section or feature of This Website, you may also be providing such personally identifiable information to the co-sponsor. When you provide your personally 
			identifiable information to any third party, EveryCarListed is not responsible for any third party's use of such personally identifiable information.</p>

			complete a transaction, service, search or other activity that the user initiated or requested, to non-"EveryCarListed Family" companies, with which we have 
			agreements, to, among other things, facilitate targeted advertising on third party websites, or to otherwise enhance your online experience. For example,

			<ul>
				<li>When you link to another site from This Website.</li>
				<li>When you request certain information that EveryCarListed obtains from a third party.</li>

			<p>When we use third party tracking services to help us analyze automatically collected information in the aggregate to evaluate the effectiveness of This Website, 
			the third parties performing such tracking services are not permitted to use the information for any other purpose.</p>

	<div class="col-md-12">
			<p>A cookie is a small data string our server writes to your hard drive that contains your unique User ID for This Website. Cookies help 
			us to identify new and returning users to This Website, analyze click-stream data, and track historical activity on This Website, which 
			allows us to give you a more personalized, useful experience on This Website. Cookies may be placed by us, by a third-party that provides 
			services to us, or a non-"EveryCarListed Family" company, with which we have an agreement.</p>
			<p>Cookies help EveryCarListed to enhance the user's online experience and can be used to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>deliver the appropriate geographic message</li>
				<li>manage frequency of ad exposure; avoid over delivery of the same message</li>
				<li>tailor an advertisement or other content to better match your interests and preferences</li>
				<li>ensure that you see the correct products and pricing applicable to the state in which you live</li>
				<li>keep track of your order as you order services</li>
				<li>understand advertising effectiveness</li>
				<li>manage features and programs made available through This Website</li>
				<li>collect anonymous traffic data</li>
			</ul>
			<p>A cookie cannot be used to access or otherwise compromise the data on your hard drive. However, customers are free to delete website cookies. Most internet browsers enable you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored.</p>
			<p>You can choose to change your browser settings to disable cookies if you do not want us to establish and maintain a unique User ID. Please be aware that cookies may be required to complete certain functions on This Website, such as ordering products or services, and, also in connection with personalized sections of This website, for example MyCars. To disable cookies, see "Setting Cookie Preferences", below. To opt-out of the placement of behavioral tracking cookies, see "How to Opt-out of Behavior Tracking Cookies" below.</p>
			<p>However, you need to understand that some websites/ad serving companies have the ability to reestablish your history even after cookie deletion, if you reenter the same site on another occasion, or some other site tracked by the ad serving company/network, and specifically provide personal data.</p>
			<p>Deletion of cookies alone does not prevent ad serving companies from reestablishing history on a user. The user must either continue to decline cookies each time it reenters the site to keep the tracking severed, if desired, or opt-out. When you opt-out, your unique user ID cookie is erased and you are reassigned an anonymous, non-id cookie. This new cookie tells websites that you have opted out and they will then know not to attempt to assign other cookies to you in the future. Opt-out cookies do not contain a unique user ID number therefore websites are not able to identify your computer uniquely.</p>
			<p>Users who choose to continually delete cookies and not opt out can have their browser advise them each time a website attempts to send a cookie to your system. At that time, you can choose to either Accept or Cancel a cookie. Users who choose to "opt out" after deleting cookies will receive an anonymous/non personally identifiable cookie.</p>
