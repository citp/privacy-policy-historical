**Privacy Policy**

_Effective date August 5, 2016_

**Introduction**

EverQuote DBA AdHarmonics (herein referred to as "we", "us" or "our") considers your privacy a very important issue. We design and operate our services with the protection of your privacy as a primary concern.

This privacy policy (the "Policy") applies to our website, EverQuote.com (the "Site") and outlines the types of information we collect via the Site, how we use that information, and the efforts we make to safeguard it. By providing any information through the Site, you agree to the use of that information consistent with this Policy.

In order to view our relationship with TRUSTe please visit the validation page visible by clicking on the TRUSTe seal. If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact TRUSTe at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request. The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this website EverQuote.com and does not cover information that may be collected through our mobile application.

**Personally Identifiable Information**

Personally identifiable information ("PII") is information that identifies you, is not generally available to the public and may include information about your family as well as you personally. We collect the PII that you provide us via the Site so that we may provide you with the service(s) we offer. If you elect, we may also collect PII from third-party data providers. You are not obligated to provide us with PII; however, if you do not provide us with certain information that we request, we may not be able to respond to your requests, process your applications or otherwise conduct the business contemplated between you and us.

For example, in order to provide you with insurance quotes, we collect your personal contact information including name, telephone number, mailing address, email address, gender, birthday, marital status, information about your vehicles and drivers and may also collect information about your credit and your existing insurance coverage.

If you are an insurance agent using EverQuote Pro to purchase referrals, we work with a third-party to collect from you and transmit your credit card and billing information. Your credit card number and related information are not accessible by us.

Technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags and scripts or similar technologies are used by EverQuote and our partners, including our marketing partners, affiliates, and analytic service providers (e.g. Google Analytics). These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or site functionality.

The Insurance Providers may provide your personal information to their insurance carriers, suppliers and other related vendors in order to generate price quotations and information relevant to insurance policies that you have requested, and the Insurance Providers may use the contact information (including telephone number(s)) you have provided to contact you directly with quotations by means of telephone (manually or auto-dialed), fax, email and postal mail, even if you have registered your phone number(s) on local and/or national no-call lists. You further acknowledge and agree that each Insurance Provider that receives your quote request from this website or from our affiliates may confirm your information through the use of a consumer report, which may include among other things, your driving record and/or credit score.

You should be aware, however, that after an Insurance Provider contacts you directly, any information you provide directly to the Insurance Provider, which may be the same as or similar to the PII you submitted to us through this Site, will no longer be covered by this Policy.

We are not and will not be responsible or liable, financially or otherwise, for any of the PII that you provide directly to any Insurance Provider or that they acquire from sources other than this Site. In addition, if you no longer want to receive communications from the Insurance Providers regarding insurance quotes, you must contact the respective Insurance Provider(s) directly and request that they no longer contact you.
