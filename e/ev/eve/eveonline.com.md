We take precautions to protect your personal data from loss, unauthorized access, copying, use, modification or disclosure.

CCP’s security measures include industry-standard technology and equipment to help protect your personal data, and we maintain security measures to allow only the appropriate personnel and third parties access to your personal data.

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password that enables you use/access the Services, you are solely responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask that you not share your password with anyone.

  6. ## How can you exercise your rights provided under data protection legislation?

CCP is committed to ensuring your rights under the European Data Protection Legislation.

You can view and rectify some elements of your personal data on your online account system, or request that our Data Protection Team rectify your data.

You have the right to access the personal data CCP has collected about you and to be informed about the purpose of its collection. You may also be entitled to a copy of the personal data undergoing processing. Furthermore, you may under certain circumstances and where technically feasible, have the right to request us to transfer your personal data to a third party.

You may also have the right to request us to restrict the processing of your personal data, for example if you object to its processing, but prefer the data not to be erased.

If the processing of your personal data is based on CCP’s legitimate interests, you have the right to object to the processing, following which we must stop the processing unless we demonstrate a compelling legitimate ground for the processing which override your interests.

In certain instances, you have the right to have your personal data erased, such as where the data is no longer necessary in relation to the purpose for which they were collected or otherwise processed, or if you withdraw your consent.

Your rights to access, erasure, restriction and portability of data are however not absolute. In those instances where we cannot accept your request, we will inform you of the reasons why, subject to any legal or regulatory restrictions.

  7. ## Revisions to this Privacy Policy

CCP may make changes to this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our legal or regulatory obligations or to the manner in which we process your personal data.

Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be effective from the time they are posted on the Sites or under our Terms of Services, as applicable.

  8. ## Change of Control

If CCP experiences a “Change of Control” (defined below), then we may amend our information practices as described in this Privacy Policy. We will disclose your personally identifiable information to the company or other legal entity that succeeds our operation of the Services. The privacy policy of the succeeding legal entity will then govern the personal data that we have collected from you under this Privacy Policy. However, if applicable law prohibits the succeeding legal entity’s privacy policy from governing your personal data, then this Privacy Policy shall continue to govern. “Change of Control” means any of the following events:

    * a reorganization, merger, consolidation, acquisition or other restructuring involving all or substantially all of our voting securities and/or assets, by operation of law or otherwise;
    * insolvency;
    * a general assignment for the benefit of creditors;
    * appointment of a receiver for our business or assets;
    * we become subject to any bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, whether domestic or foreign; or
