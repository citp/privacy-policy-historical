                           generic information about your computer is
                           collected and stored in a log file and
                           with Google Analytics. This information is
                           used to help analyze trends, streamline

                           personal information is collected. During
                           the registration process, EveryMac.com
                           requires you to provide your name, e-mail
                           address, how often you visit the site and
                           for how long, and if you wish to

                           does EveryMac.com use personally
                           identifiable information?</p>
                           
                           <p>EveryMac.com
                           uses any information voluntarily provided
                           by members to improve the experience of
                           using the website and services provided by
                           EveryMac.com, whether to provide
                           personalized or interactive portions of
                           the site, or to prepare future content
                           that is of greater interest to members.
                           For example, EveryMac.com operates an
                           opt-in mailing list (usually sent
                           bimonthly), which is personalized for each
                           member.</p>
                           
                           <p>EveryMac.com
                           uses tracking information to determine
                           which portions of the site are more
                           popular than others, but what individual
                           members read is not tracked. Likewise,
                           when a search is performed with the
                           EveryMac.com search engine, the search
                           terms used are recorded, but individual
                           search terms are not connected to
                           individual members. Both of these tracking
                           methods are helpful to determine the
                           relative popularity of individual pages
                           and to improve the accuracy of the search
                           engine, which are beneficial to everyone
                           who uses the site.</p>
                           
                           <p>EveryMac.com
                           also creates aggregate reports on member
                           demographics and traffic patterns for
                           advertisers, sponsors, and business
                           partners. This results in advertising
                           campaigns that are more effective for
                           advertisers, and advertising that is more
                           relevant for all users of EveryMac.com.
                           However, EveryMac.com does not track the
                           usage patterns of individual members, and
                           therefore, advertisers, sponsors, and
                           business partners will not be able to tell
                           that a specific user clicked on a
                           particular advertisement.</p>
