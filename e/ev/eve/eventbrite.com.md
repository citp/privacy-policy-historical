### Our Disclosure of Information That We Collect:

#### 1\. Personal Data:

Therefore, Company will not sell your Personal Data to third parties, including third party advertisers.

Business Transfers: As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets. Subsidiaries and Affiliates: We may also share your Personal Data with our subsidiaries and/or affiliates for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy. Our subsidiaries and affiliates will be bound to maintain that Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties: Company, like many businesses, sometimes engages other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, ticket fulfillment, maintaining databases and processing payments. When we engage another company to perform such functions, we may provide them with information, including Personal Data, in connection with their performance of such functions. 

Organizers: When you purchase tickets to, register for or donate to an event on our Site, you consent to our providing your Personal Data to the Organizers of such event. These Organizers are not bound to treat your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You agree that Company is not responsible for the actions of these Organizers with respect to your Personal Data. It is important that you review the applicable policies of the Organizers of an event before providing Personal Data or other information in connection with that event. 

Legal Requirements: Company may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law (including, without limitation responding to a subpoena or request from law enforcement, court or government agency) or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary (i) to comply with a legal obligation, (ii) to protect and defend the rights or property of Company, (iii) to act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Site or the public, or (iv) to protect against legal liability. 

#### 2\. Non-Personal Data:

Because Non-Personal Data cannot be used to personally identify you, Company may disclose, transfer or share Non-Personal Data for any lawful purpose. 

### Your Choices:

You have several choices available when it comes to your Personal Data: 

Limit the Personal Data You Provide: You can use the Site without providing any Personal Data or with limiting the Personal Data you provide. If you choose not to provide any Personal Data or limit the Personal Data you provide, you may not be able to use certain Site functionality and/or Company Services. For instance, in order to open an Eventbrite account, or buy or sell tickets, your name and email address will be required. 

Opt Out: You can "opt out" of receiving Company newsletter emails by logging in, clicking on "Account" and following the instructions to "email preferences." You may modify your choices at any time in your Company account. In the event an Organizer uses our system to email you, you will be able to "opt out" of receiving those communications as well. Please note that if you unsubscribe from receiving a particular Organizer's emails, you will no longer receive emails from the particular Organizer that are sent through our system (but you may still receive emails sent by that Organizer through means other than our system), however, you will still receive Company communications and communications from other Organizers whose events you have attended or are registered to attend or who have otherwise obtained your email address. Likewise, if you unsubscribe from Company communications you will continue to receive communications from Organizers. So you may have to unsubscribe from multiple emails before you stop receiving all communications. You can also unsubscribe from receiving all Organizer emails sent through our system. It may take up to 24 hours for us to process an unsubscribe request. Note that you cannot unsubscribe from Company Service communications via the Site. You can stop receiving Company Service communications only by contacting us at [/contact-us/](https://web.archive.org/contact-us) and closing your account. By electing to stop receiving all communications from Company or through Company's system you will no longer receive any updates on your account or on events you are registered to attend or have previously attended, including communications regarding refunds. We do not recommend that you do this unless you plan to no longer use the Site or Company Services, are not currently registered for an event, are not currently organizing an event and will have no need to receive further communications from Company or through Company's system. Even after you opt out of all communications, Company will retain your Personal Data and Non-Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy, however, we will no longer use it to contact you. However, Organizers who have received your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy may still use that Personal Data to contact you in accordance with their own privacy policies, but they may not use Company's system to do so. 

#### Exclusions:

This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Data collected by Company other than Personal Data collected through the Site. This Privacy Policy shall not apply to any unsolicited information you provide to Company or another user or visitor through the Site or through any other means.
