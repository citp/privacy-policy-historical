# Privacy Policy - Eventfinda

We built Eventfinda to make it easy to share information with your friends and people around you. We understand you may not want to share personal details; that is why we give you control of your information. Registration requires you to choose a username, home region and email address. Your email address is never displayed to anyone on the site. Your email address may be dislayed in emails if you use Eventfinda to connect with other people, like when sending friend invites. Other personal details will only be displayed if you fill them in - the nature of social networking websites means your details will be visible to others - but only the details you choose to supply.

Should you want your details removed completely from the Eventfinda Network there is a simple 'cancel my account' feature in your profile settings on any web site in the Eventfinda Network. Cancelling your account will completely remove your personal details from the Eventfinda Network database.
