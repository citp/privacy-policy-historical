                  We only collect Personally Identifiable Information about you
                  from our Site if you choose to provide it to us. This means
                  you can visit our Site without revealing any Personally

                  do collect information about your visit, but not about you
                  personally. This information may include the URL, IP address,
                  browser type and language, and the date and time of your
                  visit.

                  In order to use certain features of the Site and Services you
                  may be asked to register. Any Personally Identifiable
                  Information which is required and that you choose to provide
                  within the registration process will not be disclosed on our
                  Site. Once registered, you may provide additional information
                  in various areas of the site. Providing additional information
                  beyond the fields in the registration process is entirely
                  optional and such information may be visible to the public.
