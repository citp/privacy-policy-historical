What personal information do we collect? When you place an order with us, we ask for the standard personal information in our order form (such as name, address, email, contact phone number, and so forth) in order for us to properly ship your order to you. This information is kept secure in protected systems. If necessary, we may use this information to contact you (via email for example) regarding a pending order, or to answer a question prompted from a customer. 

From time to time, you may receive promotional information and special offers through e-mail or regular mail from Eve's Addiction and/or our marketing partners. However, if you do not want to receive e-mail communications or other promotional communications, you are free to opt out of our mailing list at any time. We do not sell, lease, or rent your email address without your permission. 

What other kind of information do we collect? We use a commonly known file called a ["cookie"](http://www.cookiecentral.com/content.phtml?area=2&id=1 "What is a cookie?") on our site. These are the same cookies used on millions of other websites in order to help you navigate our site. In the case of our site, we use cookies to let your computer remember the contents (products) in your shopping cart and related information. In some cases, we may use a cookie to let us know if you are coming from a site affiliated with us so that we may attend to that site's due commissions. In the case of affiliated sites, only the subtotal sale amount will be divulged to the affiliates for payment purposes. Personally identifiable information will in NO WAY be provided outside of EvesAddiction.com in these cases. 

Like most other websites, we monitor the aggregate (how many people) traffic statistics on our website. This is done in order to provide our customers with better and more efficient service. These general statistics do NOT personally identify our customers and site visitors. 

We use affiliate software to track where potential customers are coming from so that the affiliate site may be paid as a result. This software logs computer ID as a security precaution. 

How do we protect your information? We encrypt order information for your protection. EvesAddiction.com online store uses industry standard [Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)](http://developer.netscape.com/tech/security/ssl/protocol.html "What is SSL?") encryption on areas of our website where personal information is needed. EvesAddiction.com does not accept email registration, nor contest participation from children under the age of 13 due to the [Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/coppa.htm "What is COPPA?"). If you are under the age of 13, you must get parental permission to divulge your email address and order-related information before using this site. Our contests are open to users ages 13 and up, however if a sweepstake or contest winner is under 18 years old, we will require a consent from signed by the winner’s parent or guardian in order to award the prize. Our contests and sweepstakes are subject to all federal, state, and local laws and void where prohibited.
