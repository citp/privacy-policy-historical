<h1>EveryBlock privacy statement<a name="top"></a></h1>

<p>Last updated August 5, 2010</p>
<p>At EveryBlock ("EveryBlock", "we," or "us"), we are committed to ensuring the privacy of our users. This Privacy Statement ("Statement") describes how personal information is collected from users of the EveryBlock's Web site located at www.EveryBlock.com ("Site"), and how that information is used and disclosed. By using our Site, you consent to the terms of this Statement.</p>

<div class="section" id="whatis">
  <div class="sectionheader">
    <h2>What is personal information?</h2>
    <p class="sectioninfo"><a href="#top">Back to top ↑</a></p>
  </div>
  <div class="sectionwrap">
    <p>Personal information is information that specifically identifies an individual, such as a user's name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card or other account number, and information about that individual's activities when directly linked to that person such as information about his or her purchases or use of services. Personal information also includes demographic information such as date of birth, gender, geographic area and preferences when such information is linked to other personal information that identifies you.</p>
    <p>Personal information does not include "aggregate" information. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of products, services or users from which individual user identities have been removed. In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service, but no personal information will be included in the resulting data. Likewise, information about the products you purchase may be collected and combined with information about the products purchased by others. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and user needs so that we can better consider new products and services, and tailor existing products and services to user desires.</p>
