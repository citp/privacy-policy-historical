# Privacy Policy - EverythingMom

**Overview**

EverythingMom considers the protection of personal privacy to be one of our most important values.  This privacy policy (” Policy “) gives you specific information on how we protect your privacy, how we treat personal information, and the choices you have.  This privacy policy is compliant with federal and provincial privacy laws including the federal Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act.   A summary of the ten principles of fair information practices is included at the end of this Privacy Statement.

This Policy applies to all web sites and services owned or provided by EverythingMom and its subsidiaries, which we refer to here collectively as “EverythingMom Sites”.  From time to time we may add new sites, domain names or services to those listed above.  Please note that this Policy applies only to sites owned and services maintained by EverythingMom or its corporate subsidiaries and not to web sites or services provided by other companies or organizations to which we link.  

As a condition of using the EverythingMom Sites, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Policy.  Additional terms and conditions which govern your use of the EverythingMom Sites are contained in our User Agreement, and, as applicable, in certain other service-specific license agreements or terms of use, which you will be notified of at the time of your registration for the applicable services.

The Policy is accessible through the EverythingMom Sites in several ways, including from a link entitled “Privacy” at the bottom of every EverythingMom.com page.  You acknowledge that this Policy may change over time.  If we make a material change to the terms of this Policy, we will give you 30 days notice of those changes (“Notice Period”) through reasonably prominent disclosure, including via email.  However, you should check the EverythingMom Sites (and EverythingMom.com in particular) regularly for these and other important announcements.  Your continued use of the EverythingMom Sites following the Notice Period will signify that you agree to these changes.

**Children**

The EverythingMom Sites are not directed to children under the age of 13.  The EverythingMom Sites prohibit registration by, and EverythingMom will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from, anyone under 13.  This requirement will be posted at points of data collection within the EverythingMom Sites, such as registration for services.

Note to Parents.  If you have any concerns about the EverythingMom Sites, please contact us directly.  EverythingMom encourages parents to spend time online with their children.  We also urge parents to instruct their children never to give out their real names, addresses or phone numbers without parental permission when using the Internet.

**Information Collection, Storage and Use**

We refer to information that identifies an individual as “Personal Information. ” In general, EverythingMom collects Personal Information from users of the EverythingMom Sites in connection with access to certain online areas or services, including during (i) registration for certain online community services and tools such as message boards, chat rooms or other community services; (ii) registration for special communications, such as email updates and newsletters; (iii) subscription registration; (iv) user surveys; and (v) events, sweepstakes, contests or promotions.  Your Personal Information is stored on EverythingMom computer servers (or those of its service providers) located in Canada.

We may gather data about the areas of the EverythingMom Sites you visit or access.  We do not use any of this navigational data about where you “as an individual user” go on EverythingMom Sites or share any of this data with third parties.  However, we do use and share navigational data in aggregate, non-personal form to understand how our users as a group use the EverythingMom Sites.

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information in public areas of an EverythingMom Site, such as the member home pages and message boards, your information can be viewed and possibly used by others.  We advise users to be especially careful in such public areas about disclosing Personal Information, such as full name, home address, or phone number.

Below are more details about the Personal Information we, or third parties may gather from you and how we may use it.

_**F.   Use of Cookies.**_ On the Internet, a “cookie” is a piece of information (a file) that a Web site transfers to a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes.  The use of cookies is common on the Internet.  The process we use to serve advertisements and to track use of the EverythingMom Sites involves cookies.  We use cookies to recognize users who have already registered for a EverythingMom Site, allowing those users to speed up their future activities on the EverythingMom Sites.  Cookies help EverythingMom and our advertising service (discussed below) track the frequency and placement of advertisements.  Cookies also enable us to measure aggregate (total) usage and traffic to the EverythingMom Sites and to specific offerings.  This aids us in producing content that best meets our users’ preferences.  In order to implement new services, we may use other types of cookies as well.  We also may use cookies to understand better what parts of the EverythingMom Sites you like best.  We may use that information to display advertisements that we think will be of particular interest to you.  You may configure your browser to reject cookies, but this may interfere with some functionality of the EverythingMom Sites.

_**J.   Sharing Non-Personal Information.**_ EverythingMom may share information that is not Personal Information — meaning non-personal, aggregate, or summary, information regarding our users — with other third parties not mentioned in this Policy.  This kind of information does not identify you individually.

_**K.   Merger or Acquisition.**_ In the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of all or substantially all of its assets, or the sale of an individual website owned by EverythingMom, EverythingMom may transfer your Personal Information to a third party as a part of such merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale.

_**L.   Legal Authorities. **_We may also disclose Personal Information in cases when we reasonably believe that it is necessary to identify someone who may be violating EverythingMom policies or EverythingMom Sites User Agreements or other terms of use, or who may be a threat to EverythingMom or third party rights, property, or personal safety.  The EverythingMom Sites may disclose Personal Information to comply with valid legal process such as a duly issued search warrant, subpoena or court order.
