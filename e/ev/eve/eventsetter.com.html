<h3>PRIVACY POLICY</h3>

<p>EventSetter.com (“EventSetter”) operates the website EventSetter.com. It is EventSetter’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website(s).</p>

<p>Website Visitors</p>

<p>EventSetter also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, profile information, aggregate user data. EventSetter does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.</p>

<p>Aggregated Statistics</p>

<p>EventSetter may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website(s). For instance, EventSetter may monitor any and all Event Listings pages, PR Pages, Directory and all other content on the EventSetter.com site to screen for and identify spam. EventSetter may delete any of this information without notice and without any recourse.</p>

<p>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</p>

<p>Certain visitors to EventSetter’s website(s) choose to interact with EventSetter in ways that require EventSetter to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that EventSetter gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a PR Page at EventSetter.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with EventSetter – by purchasing advertising on EventSetter.com, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, EventSetter collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with EventSetter. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.  EventSetter collects user submitted information such as name(s) and email address to authenticate users and/or to send notifications to those users relating to EventSetter service(s).  EventSetter also collects other profile data in order to assist users in finding and communicating with each other.  </p>

<p>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</p>

<p>EventSetter discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on EventSetter’s behalf or to provide services available at EventSetter’s website(s), and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using EventSetter’s website(s), you consent to the transfer of such information to them. EventSetter will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, EventSetter discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when EventSetter believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of EventSetter, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an EventSetter website(s) and have supplied your email address, EventSetter may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with EventSetter and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. EventSetter takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.  
Please be aware that whenever you voluntarily post public information to EventSetter.com, the Event Listings pages, PR Page(s), the  Directory, or any other published pages on the website that that information can be accessed by the public and can in turn be used by those people to send you unsolicited communications.  EventSetter.com Event Listings pages, PR Page(s) and  Directory information including pictures, first names, last names, business names, aliases, and contact information may be displayed to website visitors in order to facilitate user interaction on EventSetter.com.  EventSetter and registered users of EventSetter may modify and/or remove any personally identifying information from the Event Listings pages, their PR Page(s), and  Directory at any time. EventSetter reserves the right to transfer personal information to a successor in interest that acquires rights to that information as a result of the sale of EventSetter or substantially all of its assets to that successor in interest.
