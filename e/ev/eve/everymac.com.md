###  Privacy Statement

EveryMac.com believes that your privacy on the Internet, and elsewhere, is of great importance. Because EveryMac.com gathers information about its users, it is important for you, as a user of EveryMac.com, to fully understand the terms and conditions regarding the collection and use of that information. This privacy policy discloses what information is gathered, how it is used, and how you can correct, change, or update this information.

  * What options are available regarding the collection, use, and distribution of this information?

What personally identifiable information does EveryMac.com collect?

When browsing the EveryMac.com website, the Internet Protocol (IP) address and other generic information about your computer is collected and stored in a log file and with Google Analytics. This information is used to help analyze trends, streamline the performance of the webserver, administer the website, and to gather broad statistical information for aggregate use. However, this information is not linked to any personally identifiable information.

When you register as an EveryMac.com member, some personal information is collected. During the registration process, EveryMac.com requires you to provide your name, e-mail address, how often you visit the site and for how long, and if you wish to participate in contests, your postal mailing address. Additional demographic information can be provided at your option, and it is appreciated, but there is no requirement to do so in order to take advantage of the special features provided for members. At any point where EveryMac.com collects personal information, a link will be provided to this privacy policy.

How does EveryMac.com use personally identifiable information?

EveryMac.com uses any information voluntarily provided by members to improve the experience of using the website and services provided by EveryMac.com, whether to provide personalized or interactive portions of the site, or to prepare future content that is of greater interest to members. For example, EveryMac.com operates an opt-in mailing list (usually sent bimonthly), which is personalized for each member.

EveryMac.com uses tracking information to determine which portions of the site are more popular than others, but what individual members read is not tracked. Likewise, when a search is performed with the EveryMac.com search engine, the search terms used are recorded, but individual search terms are not connected to individual members. Both of these tracking methods are helpful to determine the relative popularity of individual pages and to improve the accuracy of the search engine, which are beneficial to everyone who uses the site.

EveryMac.com also creates aggregate reports on member demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors, and business partners. This results in advertising campaigns that are more effective for advertisers, and advertising that is more relevant for all users of EveryMac.com. However, EveryMac.com does not track the usage patterns of individual members, and therefore, advertisers, sponsors, and business partners will not be able to tell that a specific user clicked on a particular advertisement.

With whom, if anyone, does EveryMac.com share this information?

EveryMac.com, and the principal author thereof, is the sole owner of all information collected from the website and services provided by EveryMac.com. EveryMac.com will not sell, share, or rent any personally identifiable information to any third-parties, except under specific circumstances, as described below.

**Contest Winners:** In the event that you win a prize from EveryMac.com, you will be notified of winning, and permission will be requested to provide your name, e-mail address, and postal mailing address to the sponsoring company, so they can ship your prize to you. Obviously, if your postal mailing address is not shared, you will not be able to receive your prize, as it has to be shipped to you. Nevertheless, you will be given the option of declining your prize. If you do not win a prize in an EveryMac.com contest, your information will not be shared. However, aggregate member demographic information is shared with contest sponsors.

**Legal:** In the event that you are allegedly involved in any type of criminal activity using the EveryMac.com website or services, and EveryMac.com is subpoenaed to release your membership information, EveryMac.com is required by law to comply with the subpoena. EveryMac.com also reserves the right to disclose membership information in special cases when releasing the information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against any individual who has blatantly or repeatedly violated the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20121003012239id_/http%3A//www.everymac.com/articles/admin/termsofuse.html) agreement.

EveryMac.com does not sell or rent information about individual users to anyone for any reason. However, EveryMac.com does share aggregate demographic information with advertisers, sponsors, and business partners, but this information is not linked to any personal information that could identify any individual person. However, in the event that EveryMac.com or substantially all of its assets are acquired, member information will be one of the transferred assets.

What options are available regarding the collection, use, and distribution of this information?

When you signed up to become a member of EveryMac.com, you were given the option of joining a personalized mailing list, usually sent bimonthly, to inform you of site updates. Only EveryMac.com will send you these personalized e-mail messages, and only if you indicated that you were interested in receiving these messages when you signed up. If you are not interested in receiving site update notices, do not request them when you sign up, or at any time, you can easily leave the list by using the provided instructions.

Companies that advertise on EveryMac.com may use cookies to make it easier to track banner performance. While EveryMac.com uses cookies to store login information, cookies received with advertisements are collected by the advertising companies, and EveryMac.com does not have any access to this information.

EveryMac.com provides advertisers, sponsors, and business partners with aggregate information only, in such a manner that neither the client nor EveryMac.com can associate any individual or their associated membership profile within the aggregate information.

Again, EveryMac.com does not sell or rent information about individual users to anyone for any reason, but in the event that EveryMac.com or substantially all of its assets are acquired, member information will be one of the transferred assets.
