# Advertising services | Adobe - Privacy Policy

When a company uses Adobe's advertising services, that company tells us what type of information to collect. Examples of the type of information these companies may ask Adobe to collect are:

•  Activities on that company's website, including content and ads you view or click on when you are on that company's website, app, social page, or another website that displays content or ads from that company

•  Your browsing activity, including the URL of the web page you are visiting

•  The URL of the page that showed the link you clicked on that brought you to that company's website

•  The search you performed that led you to that company's website

•  Information about your browser and device, such as device type, operating system, connection speed, and display settings

•  Your IP address, which Adobe may use to approximate your general location

•  Information you may provide on that company's website, including information on order and registration forms

•  Details relating to the types of products and services you have bought from that company

•  Ad campaign success rates, such as whether you clicked on a company's ad and whether viewing or clicking on the ad led you to purchase that company's products

The information Adobe advertising services collect belongs to the company using our services, not to Adobe. Adobe uses this information only as allowed in a contract with the company to provide services to that company. Note that sometimes Adobe has permission from these companies to access and share "aggregated" information collected by Adobe with our customers, prospective customers, and partners in order to improve our products and services, to provide reports and market research, and to understand market trends. Aggregated information is anonymous and does not identify individuals. For example, we may publish reports that show which browsers or operating systems are used to access websites of the companies that use our advertising services.

Adobe advertising services are not designed to collect information that identifies you personally, and the information these services collect for companies is not used by Adobe to personally identify you. 

Some companies may also buy additional information about you, such as your age and gender, and then add that additional information to the information collected by Adobe advertising services. Companies will often do this so they can provide you with more relevant advertising. For information on how a company uses this information, refer to that company's privacy policy.
