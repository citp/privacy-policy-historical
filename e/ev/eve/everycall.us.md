EveryCall.us Terms of Service and Privacy Policy

**Terms of Service** The existence of a complaint is not indicative of any wrong doing by the company, individual, or companies at issue.  While users may indicate wrong doing on the part of an individual or company, EveryCall.us makes no presumptions of wrong doing.
