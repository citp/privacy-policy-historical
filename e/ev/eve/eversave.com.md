**Privacy @ Eversave.com**  
Eversave.com has created this statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. We allow our users to control the amount of personal information they provide to us. Eversave.com hopes that users will feel comfortable providing this information to us, because this information allows us to tailor our Savings Offers to each member's particular interests. However, we recognize that some members will prefer not to provide certain requested information and so we've designed Eversave with the members' personal preferences in mind. 

**_What Information We Collect/How We Use It_**   
__Contact Information__. Our registration form requires users to provide e-mail address, zip code, gender, and date of birth in order to register for the Eversave.com service. Users may provide additional information, such as categories of interest, preferred stores, and demographic information. The additional information is not required to become a member, but many members choose to supply the information so that they receive offers that match their shopping interests and store preferences. Eversave.com uses the information in four ways: 1. At the member's request, we send e-mails with targeted advertising, promotions and coupons based on user's interests; 2. We contact users for feedback and surveys; 3. We send users other information about Eversave; and 4. Date of birth is required to verify that the user is qualified to participate in the Eversave service. 

Other than consumers, Eversave collects personally identifiable information from prospective affiliates in order to identify potential business partners. Eversave not only collects the aforementioned contact information but it also collects more specific information about the company such as the company's URL and how many people view it per month. More importantly, Eversave collects sensitive information on this page such as the company's Tax ID number or the individual's Social Security Number for payment purposes. 

Eversave.com will present members with offers via email and a personalized web page on behalf of leading retailers and service providers. Except as otherwise stated, Eversave.com will not knowingly share your individual information with third parties without your authorization or consent. 

__Profile Data__. We use profile data collected through the registration process described above, and through voluntary actions of registered users of the Eversave service, consisting of demographic information and shopping preferences to provide members with a personalized home page and tailored e-mails. This information allows us to provide users with specific content based on indicated interests and preferences. This information is not required in order to receive the Eversave service. Users may provide as much or as little information as they choose. However, the omission of certain information may limit the value of the Eversave experience for the member. 

Eversave acts as a consolidator of savings offers on behalf of retailers and service providers. Geographic, demographic, and category preference information across member profiles may be summarized for merchants advertising on Eversave. This helps prospective sponsors understand the viewership they will reach. Aggregate information includes percent membership by Age range and Gender, and Category preference. Please refer to the following section "Reports" for more information. 

__Public Display of Personal Information.__ Eversave.com includes a collection of personal stories, ideas, tips, etc. written by our members to be posted on our website. At the bottom of these pages is an email address that can be used to send your own stories to be published on our website. Please note that by sending a story to this email address, you are authorizing us to post your story on our website. If you include any personally identifiable information in this story such as your name or hometown, this information may be posted on the website as well. 

__Surveys & Contests__. Both during the registration process and from time-to-time thereafter our service requests information from users via contests and surveys, including asking new members to complete a survey containing profile information regarding their specific interests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Information requested in surveys or polls may be related to shopping behavior and/or other interests of the member. Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of our service. The survey information may also be used to determine which offers will be served to a particular member. 

Some of the surveys and contests relate to offers and promotions presented by our clients who sponsor the offers. In order to participate in the sponsor offer we provide you with the opportunity to share some of your contact information directly with the clients who subject the information you provide to their own information practices and privacy policies. We will provide you with notice of such instances where the information will be shared with third parties, and you will decide whether to submit any form. The choice of participation in any promotion or offer remains yours. 

__Reports__. We provide reports to a limited number of companies with which we do business. These reports include aggregate information about our users. The information in these reports will not identify individual members. No information is contained in the reports that would allow outside companies to contact members directly. 

__Referral Program__. Participants in the referral program, provide us with contact information (like the name and e-mail address) for friends and family whom they refer. By providing such information, the referring participant certifies that they have received permission from the referred person to disclose such contact information and that the referred person has given their permission to receive email communications from Eversave. We treat referral information with the same confidentiality as member information. Eversave.com sends the referred person a one-time e-mail. The person referred to us only becomes enrolled if they choose to respond to the e-mail and enter their information. They can also follow the unsubscribe directions at the bottom of the email or in the section titled "Deactivate or Change Your Status" in this privacy statement.
