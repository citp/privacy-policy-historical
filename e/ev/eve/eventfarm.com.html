		<h1>Event Farm Privacy Policy</h1>
		<p><i>This Privacy Policy was last updated on November 22nd, 2011.</i></p>
		<p>This Privacy Policy applies to all users of the Event Farm application and Our ticketing services (collectively, the "Service"), and to any information provided to Us. By using the Service, You are accepting the policies described herein. This Privacy Policy sets forth Our practices regarding collection and use of information about You.  It also sets forth Your options to access information about you that we collect, and Your options to opt-out of Our use and sharing of information. This Privacy Policy applies to transactions made, and information gathered, on Our Service only and does not apply to any other website, even websites to which We provide links. You must contact that particular website operator or company to determine what its privacy practices are, which may be different than Our practices. Also, this Privacy Policy does not apply to any contact that You have with Us or Our office outside of Your usage of Our Service via the internet.</p>
		<p>Please review this Privacy Policy periodically as We may update it from time-to-time. Each time You visit the Service or provide Us with any information, You are hereby accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy at that time. You expressly consent to Our use and disclosure of Your information as provided herein.</p>

		<h3>Summary</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Types of Information We Collect: We collect 2 types of information: "personally identifiable" information and non-"personally identifiable" information. In general, "personally identifiable" information means any type of information which could be utilized to personally identify or be readily associated with a specific user of this Service.</p></li>
			<li><p>How We Collect Information: We collect information in 4 ways: (1) information that You knowingly and voluntarily input into Our Service directly in response to particular prompts or fields; (2) information that is collected automatically when You use the Service; (3) information that is input into Our Service from sources other than You, such as our Event Affiliates in connection with events listed on Our Service. More information about how We collect information is set forth below; and (4) information about other people that users of the Service (including Event Affiliates) provide to Us, including when You use the Service to send others (for example, attendees of prior events) invitations or messages through the Service.</p></li>
			<li><p>How We Use Personally Identifiable Information: We use Your personally identifiable information to perform transactions on the Service efficiently, deliver the services that You request directly from Us or directly from one of our Event Affiliates through the Service, manage Your account, provide You with customer service, enforce Our Terms of Service, protect against or identify fraudulent transactions, contact You regarding events for which You purchased tickets on the Service (including event confirmations, changes and cancellations), and send information about events, offers and invitations to events, and other promotional materials to You from Us and from selected third parties with whom We have a business relationship.  More information about these uses is set forth below.  </p></li>
			<li><p>How We Use Non-Personally Identifiable Information: We use Your other non-personally identifiable information to customize the Service to the interests of Our users. </p></li>
			<li><p>How We Share Personally-Identifiable Information: We do not sell personal information of Users, no matter whether we obtain the information from you or from a third party.  We may share Your personally identifiable information with Our agents, representatives, contractors, vendors, service providers, and credit card issuers/banks so they can provide Us with support services such as authorization of credit card transactions, order and ticket fulfillment, and promotional fulfillment.  We may share Your personally identifiable information with Our Event Affiliates when You purchase a ticket or when you complete a registration form to any event listed on Our Service.  Your personally identifiable information may be given or transferred to a third party in connection with a transfer or sale of ownership or assets of Our business, or in the event of a bankruptcy of Our business. We may also disclose Your personally identifiable information to Our affiliated legal entities and businesses. In addition, We may disclose Your personally identifiable information to other parties when We, in Our sole discretion, suspect or determine that Our Service is being used for any unacceptable, inappropriate, or illegal purpose. We may also disclose this information where authorized by law or pursuant to any authorized law enforcement investigation, regardless of whether it was initiated by Us or by another party. More information about how we share personal information is set forth below.</p></li>
		</ul>

		<h3>What Information We Collect and How We Do It</h3>
		<p>Information can generally be collected in two ways: (1) information that is knowingly and voluntarily input into Our Service directly by You in response to particular prompts or fields; and (2) information that is collected automatically when You use the Service.</p>
		<p>Some information can be "personally identifiable." We use the term "personally identifiable" information to mean any type of information which could be utilized to identify or be readily associated with You, the user of this Service. Examples of personally identifiable information include, but are not limited to, Your name, address, telephone number, financial information, and e-mail address, or any combination thereof. In order to operate Our Service and provide You with information on events and services that may be of interest to You, We collect personally identifiable information (e.g. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address), financial information (e.g. passwords, credit/debit card numbers, bank, and other account numbers) and demographic information (e.g. zip code, hometown, gender, purchase history, and age) from You. Please note that, in some instances as described below, We treat financial information differently than We treat other types of personally identifiable information.</p>

		<h3>Voluntary Release of Information</h3>
		<p>Whenever You are prompted by the Service to complete forms, provide payment information, and make choices, for example, and You choose to do so, You are voluntarily providing information to Us. This information may or may not be personally identifiable, depending upon what You are asked to provide and how We use it. The transmission of an e-mail voluntarily initiated by You to Us can also transmit personally identifiable information about You depending upon what information You choose to include in Your e-mail. You should not send personally identifiable information through Our Service via unencrypted e-mail, particularly information that You deem to be sensitive or confidential.</p>

		<h3>Automatic Collection of Information</h3>
		<p>The automatic collection of information refers to information collected from You that does not require You to provide information in response to particular fields or prompts. This can be done through the use of software or other automated processes that Our Service uses.</p>
		<p>For example, this Service , like many websites on the internet, uses "cookies." A cookie is a small text file automatically placed on Your computer's web browser that is used to recognize users who have previously visited the Service. In general, these cookies are either "persistent", meaning the files may reside on Your computer for several months after You last accessed the Service (or until You delete or otherwise dispose of it), or on a temporary basis. Our Service also uses temporary cookies called "session cookies," which are stored for a single user session with the Service and are deleted as soon as your browser is shut down. We use cookies for purposes that include, but are not limited to, keeping track of Your purchases and other activity on the Service, delivering content specific to Your interests, saving Your password, and if You choose, saving other personal and financial information so You do not have to re-enter it each time You visit the Service. We do this to enhance Your experience on Our Service and to make it as easy to use as possible. Third-party advertisers on the Service may also place cookies on Your browser. If You wish to disable these cookies, the "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell You how to do so. Please note, however, that if You choose to set Your browser to disable cookies, You may not be able to access certain areas of Our Service.</p>
		<p>Like most websites, each time You visit the Service, We automatically collect Your "internet protocol" ("IP") address (and the website address that directed You to Us, when applicable). An IP address is a unique series of numbers that identifies each computer connected to the internet. An IP address can be used to provide information such as the date and time of a user's visit, the availability of certain requested files, the popularity of various website functions, and the amount of information transmitted to each user from a site. Presently, We use Your IP address to address the frequency of Your visits to this Service and to determine the frequency with which certain pages and functions of the Service are accessed. This will allow Us to improve the Service's functionality and to diagnose problems. Your IP address is used to help identify You and to gather demographic information.</p>

		<h3>Information Input into Our Service by Event Affiliates and Other Third Parties</h3>
		<p>We may also periodically obtain both personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information about You from other business partners, contractors, and other third parties including Event Affiliates in connection with events listed on Our Service, and add it to our account information or other information we have collected. </p>

		<h3>Information about Others</h3>
		<p>We may also collect and store personally identifiable information about other people that You and other users of the Service (including Event Affiliates) provide to Us. If You use the Service to send others (for example, attendees of prior events) invitations or messages through the Service, we may store Your personally identifiable information, and the personally identifiable information of each such recipient. We use guests' contact information to allow them to respond to promotions and invitations to events.</p>

		<h3>How We Use Your Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
		<p>We use Your personally identifiable information for a variety of purposes, including, but not limited to, helping Us to perform transactions on the Service efficiently, delivering the services that You request, managing Your account, providing You with customer service, enforcing Our Terms of Service, protecting against or identifying fraudulent transactions, contacting You regarding events for which You purchased tickets on the Service (including event confirmations, changes and cancellations), and sending information, offers, and other promotional materials to You from Us and from selected third parties with whom We have a business and/or commercial relationship.</p>

		<h3>Opting Out of Offers</h3>
		<p>From time to time, We send offers that We believe would be of interest and value to You, such as discounts, exclusive deals, information about events, offers and invitations to events, and other promotional materials from Us and from selected third parties with whom We have a business relationship. We provide You with the option of declining to receive these types of offers from Us by "opting-out" or "unsubscribing" from future offers.  By opting-out or unsubscribing, We give You the choice to not receive these types of communications, although We will still contact You regarding any specific events to which You have purchased tickets. You will be given the option to opt-out or unsubscribe after You receive Your first offer from Us. We will provide a link that You can use to opt-out or unsubscribe of receiving subsequent marketing e-mails sent by Us. Please note, however, that opting-out of receipt of e-mail communications from Us and/or third parties, but not Event Affiliates (as defined below) (or by otherwise changing or deleting Your account information), will only change the information in Our database for future transactions and communications from Us and/or third parties. These changes will not affect: (1) information already collected as part of a particular ticket purchase in Our database which may be shared with Our Event Affiliates regardless of Your e-mail preferences; and (2) information that We may have already forwarded to Event Affiliates, credit card companies, or any other third parties, as provided above. In this instance, You would have to contact each of those entities individually in order to make any changes to their use of Your personally identifiable information. If You opt-out and You still receive these offers directly from Us, please contact Us at <a href="mailto:legal@eventfarm.com">legal@eventfarm.com</a> as soon as possible so that We can add Your name to Our opt-out list.</p>
		<p>Unless You opt-out, We will use and disclose all information submitted by You for such third-party offers in the same manner in which We use and disclose all other information submitted by You for offers We sponsor. We may select third parties with whom We will share Your personally identifiable information so that they can communicate directly with You about their products and services. We have no control over third parties and cannot guarantee that they will not share Your personally identifiable information with other parties, as they may have different privacy practices as to how Your information will be handled.</p>

		<h3>How We Share Your Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
		<p>We do not sell personal information of Users, no matter whether we obtain the information from you or from a third party.  In order to process transactions and payments on the Service, We will share Your personally identifiable information with Our agents, representatives, contractors, vendors, service providers, and credit card issuers/banks so they can provide Us with support services such as authorization of credit card transactions, order and ticket fulfillment, and promotional fulfillment. We have no control over these parties and cannot guarantee that they will not share Your personally identifiable information with other parties, as they may have different privacy practices as to how Your information will be handled.</p>
		<p>When You purchase a ticket or complete a registration form to any event listed on Our Service, We will share Your personally identifiable information with the venues, promoters, producers, organizers, managers, presenters, artists, teams, organizations, business partners, authorized service providers and other third-parties associated with that particular event ("Event Affiliates"). We cannot offer You a separate opportunity to opt-out, or not to consent, to Our sharing of Your personally identifiable information with these parties, as explained below. Event Affiliates may use Your information in accordance with their own privacy policies, and may consequently use Your personally identifiable information to contact You and may share Your personally identifiable information with others. You must contact those Event Affiliates directly to instruct them regarding Your preferences for their use of Your personally identifiable information.</p>
		<p>Your personally identifiable information may be given or transferred to a third party in connection with a transfer or sale of ownership or assets of Our business, or in the event of a bankruptcy of Our business. We may also disclose Your personally identifiable information to Our affiliated legal entities and businesses. However, all of the affiliated legal entities and businesses that receive Your personally identifiable information from Us will comply with the terms of this Privacy Policy with respect to their use and disclosure of Your personally identifiable information. In addition, We may disclose Your personally identifiable information to other parties when We, in Our sole discretion, suspect or determine that Our Service is being used for any unacceptable, inappropriate, or illegal purpose. We may also disclose this information where authorized by law or pursuant to any authorized law enforcement investigation, regardless of whether it was initiated by Us or by another party.</p>

		<h3>How We Use Financial Information</h3>
		<p>Personally identifiable information includes financial information.  Therefore, we use the term "financial information" as a sub-category of personally identifiable information relating to credit card, billing, and payment information that You provide to Us when You transact business on Our Service. We use Your financial information to bill You for products and services and to enable You to participate in discount, rebate, and similar programs in which You choose to participate. By making a purchase or engaging in any other kind of activity that uses financial information on Our Service, You hereby consent and allow Us to provide Your financial information to Our Event Affiliates, service providers, credit card companies, banking institutions, processing centers, and/or to such other third parties as We determine to be necessary to handle and process Your transactions. Except as provided below, We do not make Your financial information available to third parties unrelated to a particular event or transaction without Your consent.</p>
		<p>In addition, as stated earlier with regard to personally identifiable information generally, depending upon the circumstances of Our ticketing service arrangements with particular venues and event promoters, We may share Your financial information with applicable Event Affiliates for the primary purpose of dispute resolution and customer service at the venue on, before or after the date of the event. This sharing of Your financial information may be necessary in order for You to gain admittance to the event and for identification verification purposes or to otherwise resolve any problems that occur while at the event.</p>
		<p>As noted above with personally identifiable information, financial information may be given or transferred to a third party in connection with a transfer or sale of ownership or assets of Event Farm, or in the event of a bankruptcy of Event Farm. We may also disclose Your financial information to Our subsidiary and parent companies and businesses, and other affiliated legal entities and businesses. However, all of the affiliated legal entities and businesses that receive Your financial information from Us will comply with the terms of this Privacy Policy with respect to their use and disclosure of Your financial information. In addition, We will disclose Your financial information to other parties when We, in Our sole discretion, suspect or determine that Our Service is being used for any unacceptable, inappropriate, or illegal purpose. We may also disclose this information where authorized by law or pursuant to any authorized law enforcement investigation, regardless of whether it was initiated by Us or by another party.</p>

		<h3>How We Use Other Information</h3>
		<p>We use Your other non-personally identifiable information, such as general demographic information, to customize the Service to the interests of Our users. We may share this information with Our Event Affiliates. We may also share anonymous, aggregated demographic information with advisors, advertisers, investors and other third parties for general business analysis purposes and so that advisors can customize their advertisements, promotions, and communications to the appropriate audience. There may also be certain instances when We provide third parties with Your personally identifiable and specific demographic information on a non-anonymous basis. We will not, however, knowingly and intentionally provide these parties with Your financial information.</p>

		<h3>Your Postings</h3>
		<p>We may provide areas on our Service where You can post information about Yourself, communicate with others, post reviews or upload content. Whenever You disclose personal information publicly (such as on publicly viewable web pages), that information becomes public and can be collected and used by others. We can't control who reads Your posting or what others may do with information You voluntarily post, so we encourage You to use Your discretion with respect to posting personal information. Also, such postings are governed by Our Terms of Service, so be sure to review them before posting.</p>

		<h3>Visiting Our Service from outside the United States</h3>
		<p>This Privacy Policy covers the collection of information on the Service from United States residents. If You are visiting the Service from outside the United States, please be aware that Your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where Our servers are located and Our central database is operated. United States data protection and other laws may not be as comprehensive as those in Your country.</p>

		<h3>Our Security Precautions</h3>
		<p>We attempt to protect Your personally identifiable information by utilizing reasonable security measures to prevent loss, misuse, alteration, unintentional destruction or unauthorized access. We use secure server software (SSL) for Your Service transactions. We encrypt all of Your personally identifiable information as it travels over the Internet and We store Your financial information on Our servers in encrypted form. However, no system can be completely secure. Although We take significant steps to secure Your information, there is always a chance that Your information will not always remain secure, and You should always take great care in handling and disclosing Your personally identifiable information. If You learn that Our security measures have been compromised or have other concerns, please inform Us immediately at <a href="mailto:legal@eventfarm.com">legal@eventfarm.com</a>.</p>

		<h3>Access to Your Personally Identifiable and Other Information</h3>
		<p>When You register to create an account with the Service or complete a purchase transaction on the Service, We will either give You the opportunity to set certain e-mail preferences when You register or make Your purchase, or We will automatically set certain e-mail preferences for You. When You receive a confirmation e-mail from Us confirming Your registration or purchase, You will be provided with a link to change these preferences or Your registration information. As noted earlier, however, changing Your preferences will only affect future communications directly from Us and not from Event Affiliates or other third parties who may have already received Your information.</p>

		<h3>Contact Information</h3>
		<p>If You have any questions or concerns about Our Privacy Policy or the practices of the Service, You can contact Us at <a href="mailto:legal@eventfarm.com">legal@eventfarm.com</a>, by phone at (888) 444-8162, or by mail through our Corporate Office located at Event Farm, Inc., 20331 Irvine Avenue, Suite E2, Newport Beach, CA 92660.</p>
