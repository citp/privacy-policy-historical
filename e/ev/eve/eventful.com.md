## What Information We Collect

We only collect Personally Identifiable Information about you from our Site if you choose to provide it to us. This means you can visit our Site without revealing any Personally Identifiable Information. Like most web sites, our web servers do collect information about your visit, but not about you personally. This information may include the URL, IP address, browser type and language, and the date and time of your visit. 

In order to use certain features of the Site and Services you may be asked to register. Any Personally Identifiable Information which is required and that you choose to provide within the registration process will not be disclosed on our Site. Once registered, you may provide additional information in various areas of the site. Providing additional information beyond the fields in the registration process is entirely optional and such information may be visible to the public. 

##  How We Use the Personally Identifiable Information You Provide To Us 

We may use your Personally Identifiable Information to register you to use our Services, to verify your authority to use certain features of our Site and Services, to improve and tailor the content and general administration of our Site and Services, and, based upon the email settings which you may select, to deliver certain content, information, services and notices from Eventful as well as communications regarding information, events, content, products and services of our third party partners. 

##  Opting In and Out of Email Communications from Eventful and Third Parties 

By providing your email address while signing up for Eventful or submitting a Demand via Eventful's Demand it! service you automatically grant permission to Eventful and its strategic alliance partners to send email communications to you. During the sign up and Demand it! process you may also indicate via a check-box whether you grant permission for Eventful to share your email address with additional third parties and for those third parties to send emails directly to you.

If you do not wish to be included on the list of users disclosed to our third party partners, you may indicate this preference during the sign up or Demand submission or you may manage your opt in preferences as described above. To stop receiving communications from a third party to whom we have already provided your information prior to your opting out, contact that third party directly or click unsubscribe from an email which you receive from the third party. We may disclose your personally identifiable information: (a) to complete a transaction that you initiate, (b) as required by law, (c) when necessary to protect the safety of customers, employees, or property, (d) when you specifically authorize it or (e) when required to service the company's system infrastructure.
