We collect information directly from you, about you from third parties, and automatically through your use of our Services: 

  * **Information you give us.**
    * In order to access certain features of our Services such as posting content, demanding an event, subscribing to email newsletters, and other features, we require you to register with us. When you register with us, we require you to provide your email address, year of birth, location and gender. In addition, at your option, you may provide your name, photograph, interests and whatever biographical information you may choose to share.

  * **Information we collect from Facebook and other third party services.**
    * You may sign into our Site through Facebook or other third party services. If you do so, we will request your permission to access and collect information including your (i) public profile, list of friends, email address, birthday, interests, current city, personal description, publish stream, event rsvp's and likes; and (ii) to post to your friends on your behalf.
    * With your permission, we may collect data from services you use such as Spotify, Last.fm, iTunes and others in order to learn more about your entertainment preferences and tailor the content we present to you. 
    * We store the information that we receive from third party services with other information that we collect from you or receive about you. We have no control over third party services use or disclose the personal information they collect about you. Please review their policies if you have questions about such disclosure. 
  * **Information we collect and store automatically from your use of our Services and may combine with your personal information.** We automatically collect information about your use of our Services including the content you view, the things you click and other actions that you take. ****
    * **Device and server log information.**
      * usage information about the services you use and how you use them, like when you view, search and interact with our content 
      * device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version and unique device identifiers, as permitted) 
      * IP address 
      * browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL 
      * cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your Eventful account 
    * **Location information**. When you use a location-enabled Eventful Service, such as our mobile applications, we will request your permission to collect and process information about your actual location, like latitude and longitude provided by the location services of your mobile device. We may also use various technologies to determine location, such as using your IP address to look up geographic information. We collect this and other information using the following technologies: ****
    * **Local storage / Flash**. We may use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to store your Site preferences, to personalize your visit, or to display content based upon what you view on our Site. Third Parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, may use Flash cookies to collect and store information. We do not have access to or control over these third party cookies nor does this Privacy Policy cover such third parties' use of data. Flash LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored. Typically, you cannot typically control, delete, or disable the acceptance of Flash cookies through your web browser. For more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash LSOs, go to the Adobe Flash Player Help Page, choose "Global Storage Settings Panel." We may collect and store information locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches. 
    * **Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)**. We or the third parties we engage to track and analyze Site Data may employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs) to help us better manage content on the Site. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer's hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information. In addition, emails we send may contain a "web beacon" which allows us to understand the time and date of when you open an email and when you utilized a link within the email. Our web beacons do not collect Personally Identifiable Information. Users wishing to disable our web beacons should do so by turning images "off" in their email client (e.g., Outlook, Outlook Express). Please see your email provider for more information. 
    * **Cookies and anonymous identifiers.** We use various technologies to collect and store information when you use an Eventful Service, this may include sending one or more **[cookies](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-cookie)** or [anonymous identifiers](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-identifier) to your device. We also use cookies and anonymous identifiers when you interact with services we offer to our partners, such as Eventful features that may appear on other sites. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Users of our Service who disable cookies will be able to use certain features of the Service, but some features may not function including personalization and content recommendations. 
    * **Third Party Cookies.** We, or a data provider we have engaged, may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to enable you to receive customized ads, content or services. The cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us, e.g., your email address, that we may share with a third party solely in hashed, non-human readable form. You may opt out of such sharing by signing in to Eventful online and managing your preferences.

##  **Third-Party Ad Networks**

We participate in third party ad networks that may display advertisements on our Site or on other websites based on your visits to our Site as well as other websites. This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements by displaying ads for products and services in which you might be interested. Third party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party's specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third-party advertisers with information about your usage of our Site and our services, as well as aggregate or non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our Site and users of our service. 

You may opt-out of many third-party ad networks, including those operated by members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") and the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA"). For more information regarding this practice by NAI members and DAA members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including how to opt-out of third-party ad networks operated by NAI and DAA members, please visit their respective websites: [www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp](http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp) (NAI) and [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) (DAA). 

Opting out of one or more NAI member or DAA member networks (many of which will be the same) only means that those members no longer will deliver targeted content or ads to you. It does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our Site or other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your NAI or DAA opt-out may no longer be effective. Additional information is available on NAI's and DAA's websites accessible by the above links.

Eventful may use encryption, password protection, and other security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to your Personally Identifiable Information.

You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.
