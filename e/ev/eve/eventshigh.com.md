10.    OUR DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION
    Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your
    private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be
    disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example
    (without limiting and foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the
    government,     law   enforcement     agencies    or third    parties. Under certain
    circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or
    private communications, or members may abuse or misuse your information that


they collect from our Website/Application. Therefore, although we use industry
standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not
expect, that your personally identifiable information or private communications
would always remain private.
As a matter of policy, we do not sell or rent any personally identifiable information
about you to any third party. However, the following describes some of the ways
that your personally identifiable information may be disclosed:
a. External Service Providers: There may be a number of services offered by
   external service providers that help you use our Website/Applications. If you
   choose to use these optional services, and in the course of doing so, disclose
   information to the external service providers, and/or grant them permission to
   collect information about you, then their use of your information is governed by
   their private policy.
b. Other Corporate Entities: We share much of our data, including personally
   identifiable information about you, with our parent and/or subsidiaries that are
   committed to serving your online needs and related services, throughout the
   world. Such data will be shared for the sole purpose of enhancing your browsing
   experience and providing our services to you. To the extent that these entities
   have access to your information, they will treat it at least as protectively as they
   treat information they obtain from their other members. It is possible that We
   and/or its subsidiaries, or any combination of such, could merge with or be
   acquired by another business entity. Should such a combination occur, you
   should expect that we would share some or all of your information in order to
   continue to provide the service. You will receive notice of such event (to the
   extent that it occurs).
   Law and Order: We cooperate with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other
   third parties to enforce laws, such as: intellectual property rights, fraud and
   other rights. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about


       you to law enforcement and other government officials as we, in our sole
       discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation
       of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or
       may expose us or you to legal liability.
11.    ACCESSING AND REVIEWING INFORMATION
   Following registration, you can review and change the information you submitted. If
   you change any information we may or may not keep track of your old information.
   You can change your registration information such as: name, phone number, and
   other profile information.
   We will retain in our files information you have requested to remove for certain
   circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our
   terms and conditions. Further, such prior information is never completely removed
   from our databases due to technical and legal constraints, including stored 'back up'
   systems. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personally identifiable
   information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your
   requests.
12.    CONTROL OF YOUR PASSWORD
   When you sign up to become a Member, you will also be asked to choose a password.
   You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password. It
   is important that you protect it against unauthorized access of your account and
   information by choosing your password carefully, and keeping your password and
   computer secure by signing out after using our services.
    You agree not to use the account, username, email address or password of another
   Member at any time or to disclose your password to any third party. If you choose to
   share this information with third parties to provide you additional services, you are
   responsible for all actions taken with your login information and password and
   therefore should review each third party's privacy policy. You are responsible for all


   actions taken with your login information and password, including fees. If you lose
   control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personally
   identifiable information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your
   behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you
   should immediately change your password. You agree to notify us immediately if you
   suspect any consistent unauthorized use of your account or access to your password
   even after changing it.
13.    OTHER INFORMATION COLLECTORS
   Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document only
   addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent
   that you disclose your information to other parties, whether they are on our
   Website/Application or on other sites throughout the Internet, different rules may
   apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. To the extent
   that we use third party advertisers, they adhere to their own privacy policies. Since
   we do not control the privacy policies of the third parties, you are subject to ask
   questions before you disclose your personal information to others.
14.    SECURITY
   We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized
   access. We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from
   unauthorized access by members inside and outside the company. ​           We do not
   recommend transfer of sensitive information (such as credit card number) and bank
   account details via the Site and mobile Applicationto other Users. Users are
   recommended to do so offline, on the phone or via personal emails. We follow
   generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted
   to us, both during transmission and once We receive it. However, "perfect security"
   does not exist on the Internet. You therefore agree that any security breaches beyond
   the control of our standard security procedures are at your sole risk and discretion.


15.    DISCLAIMER
   We cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal
   information (including sensitive information like credit card information and bank
   account number) will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this
   Privacy Policy. Therefore, although we are committed to protecting your privacy, we
   do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information will
   always remain private. As a user of the Site, you understand and agree that you
   assume all responsibility and risk for your use of the Site and mobile
   Website/Application, the internet generally, and the documents you post or access
   and for your conduct on and off the Site.
