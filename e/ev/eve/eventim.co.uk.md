Your IP address may also be used to assist in the detection of fraud and we shall have the right to pass this information to the police.

Cookies are used to keep track of what is in the shopping cart as well as for compiling statistics on the usage of the ticket shop in order to continually improve the offer for the user. Eventim does not use technologies that link accumulating information with user data through cookies to determine the identity of the user. The Site can be used without cookies, however, if you choose to disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent, you may not be able to access some areas of the Site. 

III. Information We Request Directly From You 
    

Our Site's registration forms, order forms and other forms may require you to give us personal information (like your name, address and/or email address). You must register on our site to order tickets, and you will be asked to provide financial information so your order may be processed. You may retrieve and modify data saved to enable your use of the Site via your user account at any time. Under certain circumstances, personal data can only be deleted following a certain period of time due to legal or contractual storage obligations. In this case, the affected data will be locked until the time of deletion. 

IV. How We Use Personal Information 
    

Your personal information is shared between Eventim and the Promoter or Venue for the particular event for which you are buying tickets in accordance with this Privacy Policy and Eventim's contractual relationship with the Promoter or Venue. Your personal information is used by us to contact you by post, phone or by email when necessary in connection with transactions entered by you on the Site. We will not use your personal information for communications not associated with your transactions without your explicit consent. We will not pass your data to third parties unless you provide your explicit consent. 

V. Opting Out
    

You may opt out of any of Eventim's regular email contact at any time even if you have previously indicated your consent to such contact at some other time. 

VI. How We Use Financial Information
    

Financial information that is collected is used to authorise payment and bill you for products and services. When you make a purchase on the Site, your consent is given to provide your financial or personal information to those third parties necessary to process your transactions with us, such as credit card companies, banks and the companies that handle shipping on our behalf. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Except as provided above, we will not share financial information with third parties without your prior consent. 

VII. Disclosure of Your Personal Information and Financial Information in Compliance with Laws
    

We may release your personal information or financial information when we believe it is necessary to comply with laws or regulations, to assist law enforcement, to enforce the terms under which you transacted with Eventim, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Eventim, users of the Site or others.

IX. Our Security Precautions
    

This Site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. We use 128 bit industry standard Secure Server Software (SSL) for your transactions with us. It encrypts all of your personal information, including credit card number, name, and address, so that it cannot be read as the information travels over the Internet.

X. Consumer Protection
    

These General Terms and Conditions (Internet) are subject to the relevant provisions of The Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000. 

XI. Social Network plug-ins
    

Our web site hosts social plug-ins for the many social networks. 

When a web page containing a social plug-in (such as the ‘Like/Recommend’ or 'Tweet' button) is accessed, the user’s browser connects to the social networks servers and the content required for the social plug-ins is downloaded. The operator of the social network receives the web address of the web site accessed by the user, the date and time of access and the IP address of the user amongst other information. If the user is logged into their social network account, the social network may be able to relate the visit to that page to the user’s social network account. If the user clicks the social network button inside our web site, this information may also be transferred to the social network and stored there. If the user does not wish this information to be sent to the social network, he or she must log out of their social network before visiting our web site. If the user of the web site is not a member of the social network, there is still a possibility that the social network will identify and store the user’s IP address. 

Eventim UK Limited has no control over the content of the plug-ins or of the information transferred to social networks. The purpose and scope of data collection, the further processing and use of the data by the social networks and the user’s rights and setting options to protect the user’s privacy can be found in the privacy policies of the networks, for example:
