  5. What we do with your Information  
We will use your personal information for a number of purposes including  
• To process your orders and provide our services, goods or online content, to provide you with information about them and to deal with your requests and queries.  
• To administer competitions and provide/deliver prizes.


  * For administration purposes which means we may contact you for reason related to goods or services ordered or online content you have signed up for, to let you know that a service or online site has been suspended for maintenance, if your subscription is about to expire to ask if you wish to renew it or if an online account has become dormant to ask if you wish to retain the account before we close it.  
• To provide personalised communications.  
• Where we provide personalised services, we may analyse the information you supply, as well as your activity on our (and other) services, so we can offer a more relevant, tailored service. For example, if you view the sports page, especially football news, first thing each day, we can present this information when you first log in. If you have selected personalised emails through your DCT account (DCT Passport) you will receive specific email content, for example our business newsletter. You can opt out of any email services at any time by logging into your passport account or clicking unsubscribe on any received emails.  
If you do not wish a personalised service you can unsubscribe from this by amending your preferences in the DCT Passport or email privacy@dcthomson.co.uk.  
• A certain amount of advertising is tailored to the individual based on viewing and/or purchase habits. This is a common practice known as online behavioural advertising. You can find out more in What is online behavioural advertising.  
• We may show you relevant advertising on third party sites. See section 7 (on marketing)  
• To contact you about a submission you have made including any content you provide.  
• We use IP addresses and device identifiers to identify the location of users, to establish the number of visits from different countries, to limit/cap adverts of a certain type, personalise content and emails, and allow access to paywall protected content.  
• For analysis and research to improve our services and goods offered.  
• We may use and disclose information in aggregate (so no individuals are identified) for marketing and strategic development purposes.


  6. What if I don’t provide some or all of the information requested?  
The impact of this will depend on what information you withhold but the main impacts may be:  
• We may not be able to process or fully process your order.  
• We may not be able to contact you to let you know of problems regarding your order or the goods/services provided.


  * We may not be able to notify you regarding winning a competition or deliver the prize.  
• We may not be able to respond fully to requests and queries you may have.  
• We cannot personalise the service you receive. So, if you are online you will have to search more for the content type you normally view or for similar/related products.  
• We won’t be able to limit online adverts to products or services you have shown interest in and so you may receive adverts that mean nothing to you and are not related to your interests.

We may personalise the message content based on information you provide us with, purchases you make and your use of DC Thomson websites.



We may use information which we hold about you to show you relevant advertising on third party sites (e.g. Facebook, Google, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter). This could involve showing you an advertising message where we know you have a DC Thomson account and/or have used our products and services. If you don’t want to be shown targeted advertising messages from us, some third party sites allow you to request not to see messages from specific advertisers on that site in future.

  8. What grounds (legal basis) are we processing the data under?  
There are a number of ground we process your data under. These are  
• Contractual – we need the information to preform the contract for goods or services you have requested/ordered including payment, delivery etc.  
• Legal – should we be legally required to contact you concerning a product e.g. a product recall.  
• Legitimate interest – this means the processing is in DC Thomson interest.

This may include the notification of lapsed subscriptions.

  10. Internal Sharing  
As a Beano enthusiast you may have signed up for a Beano comic subscription or to the Beano website or both. The comic is produced by DC Thomson media (our publishing arm) and the website along with other online and offline activities are run by the DC Thomson company known as Beano Studios.

We will only share the information needed to provide you with the services you are using and will not routinely share all the data we hold on you.

These third parties may be located outside the European Economic Area; however we only use providers that provide adequate protection for your information at all times.

• The country in question has been deemed safe for data transfer by the European Commission. Also known as an adequacy finding.  
• The contract for data processing contains the standard contractual clauses laid down by the European Commission to safeguard the transfer of personal data.  
• Binding corporate rules – this is where a large company’s own internal processes for international data transfer have been signed-off and agreed by the European Commission as safeguarding the data.  
• If the data is going to the USA it can be safely transferred to a company that is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield.  
• Appropriate certification schemes
