# Privacy Policy -- EventHubs.com

EventHubs collects usernames, email addresses and IP addresses for the purpose of security, verification and preventing abuse. This information, with the exception of IP addresses, is only collected from users who sign up for an EventHubs account. IP addresses are logged for security measures and preventing abuse.

The information we collect is not shared with other parties, nor is it available for sale in any way, and is locked behind systems that stops outside access.

Location information in our Player Finder is masked with the purpose of hiding user's specific locations — as we show things at a general zip code or city level, instead of anything more specific. We also take additional measures to hide our member's locations to an approximate spot in a square mile radius, when doing searches, instead of a specific location, to further hide user locations. Specific user location information is NOT stored in the Player Finder, even if it is initially provided, as we convert this to a general region (city or zip code) instead of a specific address. Location information can be changed and altered any time by our users, and is not verified in any way on our end.

Game service user IDs (PSN, XBL), fighting game preferences and character preferences are all stored publicly in your profile, with those who choose to share them, and may be edited at any time.
