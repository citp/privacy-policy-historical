**Our privacy policy**  
Archant is committed to respecting your privacy. This statement sets out how Archant Regional websites comply with European Community data protection requirements. We are registered under the Data Protection Act 1998.  
This privacy statement applies to this website only – it does not cover other websites to which we may provide links, or to Archant websites other than those operated by Archant Regional.

**Is it possible to access the website without disclosing personal data?**  
Yes. You can visit the website without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information. Once you choose to provide us with any information by which you can be identified, it will only be used in accordance with this privacy statement. 

**What information do we collect?**

We collect the personal data that you volunteer on forms you submit to us (for example in registering for membership services), and in emails you send to us.  
Where you can order products, we will collect your name, contact and billing information, transaction and credit card information. 

**What do we do with the information we gather?**  
We require this information to understand your needs and provide you with a better service. We will also use it to send you the information you have requested – for example details of houses for sale and jobs which match your requirements.   
We may contact you for market research purposes or to give you information about new features on the website. You will only be contacted if you have given us authority to do so.

**Do we disclose your personal data to third parties?**  
We will ensure that your personal data will not be disclosed to third parties except insofar as you have consented to such disclosure or we are required to do so by law.   
Your personal data may be disclosed to other companies within the Archant Group.

**Can I see the information you hold about me? And can I amend it?**  
You may request details of personal information which we hold about you under the Data Protection Act 1998. If you would like a copy of the information, please write to Celia Sutton, Data Protection, Archant Regional, Prospect House, Rouen Road, Norwich, Norfolk NR1 1RE, or email dataprotection@archant.co.uk.

If you believe that any information we are holding on you is incorrect, please write or e-mail us to the above address. We will correct any information which was found to be incorrect within 28 days and without charge.

If you have agreed to the disclosure of personal information and to receiving marketing and promotional information, but no longer wish to do so, then please contact us.

If you are unhappy with our response, you can ask the Information Commissioner to assess whether the requirements of the Data Protection Act have been met. Write to The Information Commissioner at Wycliffe House, Water Lane, Wilmslow, Cheshire SK9 5AF.

**Is the information you hold on me secure?**  
We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure we have put in place physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect on line. All employees who have access to your personal data are contractually obliged to respect your confidentiality.

We have put in place technology measures and security policies and procedures to protect personal information from unauthorised access, improper use, alteration, unlawful or accidental destruction or accidental loss.

**Do we use cookies?**  
Yes. A cookie is a piece of text which asks permission to be placed on your computer’s hard drive. Your browser adds that text in a small file. A cookie helps us to analyse web traffic and allows websites to respond to you as an individual. For example cookies are used for membership details on the property, jobs and business sections.

**Do you gather any other information?**
