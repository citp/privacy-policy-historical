Please be advised that personal information submitted by individuals acting solely in a business capacity (e.g., personal information contained in job applicant's resume) is not subject to the uses set forth above or to any other practices stated in this Privacy Policy.

Third-party web sites and companies with links to and from the uCool Sites and Services, including Facebook, may collect personally identifiable information about users.

We do not control the privacy policies of third parties that have web sites linked to the uCool Sites and Services. If you are utilizing such a site or click on a third-party advertisement or link, the privacy policies of the third-party web site that you are using or link to will govern the use of your information by that web site’s operator. uCool’s Privacy Policy does not extend to these external web sites and companies.
