                This Privacy Policy is effective as of January 1st, 2012.
              </p>

              <p>
                This policy explains our information practices, defines your privacy options and
                describes how your information is collected and used by Echobit LLC ("Echobit"), the

              </p>

              <p>
                This Site, the Evolve client software (the “Software”) and the APIs developed by
                Echobit (the "APIs") allow you to play games with your friends, meet and play with
                new friends, chat with fellow gamers, track your playtime and achievements across
                thousands of games, and share game-related media content.
              </p>

              <p>
                This privacy policy will address the information you provide us or that we collect
                when you visit or use this Site, use our Software or provide information through the
                APIs.
              </p>

              <p>
                By using visiting the Site, the Software or the APIs you agree to the collection and
                use of information in the manner described in this policy. Echobit shall have right

                Other Collected Data
              </h4>

              <p>
                In addition to the personal information you supply, we collect certain information
                to evaluate how visitors, guests, and members use the Site or Software. We collect

                client logs, installation logs, access timestamps, and system fingerprints.
              </p>

                In addition to the above collection of data, we can collect, with your permission,
                account credentials for certain third party services (e.g. Steam, AIM, MSN, PSN,
                ICQ, and so on) as part of our efforts to let you show your comprehensive gaming
                history unified via your Site profile.

                From time to time, you may be invited to participate in optional customer surveys or
                promotions, and Echobit may request that you provide some or all of the above listed

                commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard the information that you submit to

                relationship management, database storage and management, and direct marketing

                services, and only pursuant to binding contractual obligations requiring such third

                You can access and maintain your personally identifiable information on the settings

                Disclosure and Use of Information
              </h4>

              <p>
                We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as
                required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our
                rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process. It is
                also possible that Echobit would sell all or substantially all of its assets and
                business. In any transaction of this kind, customer information, including your
                personally identifiable information, may be among the assets that are transferred.
                If we decide to so transfer your personally identifiable information, you will be
                notified by email or by a post to the Site. In addition, we reserve the right to
                collect, store, maintain, analyze and disclose to third parties all non-personally
                identifiable information concerning (1) your use of the Site, (2) your use of the
                Software and (3) any other information you might post to the Site or submit

                our site, and to read the privacy statements of each web site that collects
                personally identifiable information. Some linked sites may be co-branded with our
                Evolve trademarks and those of our business partners. They may have the look and
                feel of evolvehq.com, but the URL in your browser window will indicate that you are
                visiting a different site. This policy only applies to information collected by
