# Privacy Policy - Evolution Slimming Weight Loss & Nutrition

## This privacy policy sets out how Evolution Slimming uses and protects any information that you give Evolution Slimming when you use this website.

### What information we collect

#### We may collect the following information:

  * First name, surname and title
  * Contact information such as telephone number & email address
  * Demographic information such as address, IP address & postcode



#### What we do with the information we gather

We require this information to understand your needs and provide you with a better service, and in particular for the following reasons:

  * Placing, processing and dispatching your order(s)
  * Internal record keeping
  * Analyse demographic and geographical location data via Google Analytics using cookies.
  * Provide you with website sharing services and social network connectors
  * We may use the information to improve our products and services.
  * We may periodically send promotional emails about new products & special offers
  * From time to time, we may also use your information to contact you for market research purposes
  * We may use the information to customise the website according to your interests
  * Serve you adverts & reminders for our own products via display advertising, social media networks and email



#### Email marketing services

From time to time, we may contact you regarding offers and updates on our products and services. These emails may be personalised to contain your name for promotional reasons.

You may follow the ' **Unsubscribe** ' link in the footer of marketing emails to unsubscribe from them directly.

**Integration of the Trusted Shops Trustbadge**

Following an order, the Trusted Shops Trustbadge is incorporated into this web page in order to display our Trusted Shops trustmark for buyers and the eventually collected reviews, as well as the Trusted Shops product offer.

In balancing the various interests, this serves to safeguard our legitimate prevailing interests in an optimised marketing of our offer. The Trustbadge and the services advertised are an offer of Trusted Shops GmbH, Subbelrather Str. 15C, 50823 Köln.

Whenever a Trustbadge is called up, the web server automatically stores a so-called server log file which contains, for example, your IP address, the date and time of retrieval, the data volume transferred and the requesting provider (access data), and documents the retrieval. This access data will not be evaluated and will be automatically overwritten seven days after your visit to the page.

Other personal information will only be transferred to Trusted Shops if you decide, after completing an order, to use Trusted Shops products or have already registered for their use. In this case, the contractual agreement between you and Trusted Shops applies.

### How you can move or block cookie use at any time

You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website and prevent you from placing an order.

### Security

We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure, we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

### How we use cookies

A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive. Once you agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyse web traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual.

We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us analyse data about web page traffic and improve our website in order to tailor it to customer needs. We only use this information for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the system.

Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.

You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.

We gather statistics around email opening and clicks using industry standard technologies to help us monitor and improve our e-newsletter.
