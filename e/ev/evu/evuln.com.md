  * We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.

eVuln.com operates web-based services. It is eVuln.com's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites. This privacy policy describes the choices available to you regarding our use of the personal information we collect and how you can access and update this information.

## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, eVuln.com collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. eVuln.com's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how eVuln.com’s visitors use its website. From time to time, eVuln.com may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

eVuln.com also uses third party tracking-utility partners who use log files to collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. eVuln.com does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to eVuln.com's websites choose to interact with eVuln.com in ways that require eVuln.com to gather personally-identifying information.

We also provide them the opportunity to provide additional information such as name and phone number. Those who engage in transactions with eVuln.com – by purchasing a account plan at eVuln.com, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, eVuln.com collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with eVuln.com. eVuln.com does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
