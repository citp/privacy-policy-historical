**EVITE PRIVACY POLICY**

Evite ("Evite") Statement on Privacy and Security of Information. The following policy explains our information gathering and dissemination practices. Please be aware that the Evite service is not intended for children under the age of 13. The Evite website is wholly owned by Ticketmaster and operated by the Citysearch.com division of Ticketmaster. Citysearch.com may receive information, including personally identifiable information, from Evite visitors. Please see Citysearch.com's [privacy policy](http://www.citysearch.com/CitySearch/Company/privacy_policy.html) for more information. 

**Information Collected**

When you register with the Evite ™ service, our registration form may require you to give us certain information such as your name, e-mail address, zip code, and country, and asks for optional information such as your gender and age. Evite will also collect other information you volunteer to us through use of our service, such as the information you include in your Reminders. You may always choose not to provide such voluntary information to us; however, this may limit our ability to provide you with a specific service or particular content. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site, generally through surveys and forms on an optional basis. 

When you send messages to others through our service (e.g., an Evite invitation or a Reminder), we collect and retain the e-mail addresses or other pertinent contact information of those persons to whom you send the message. 

We use cookies, which are strings of text and numbers that can identify your computer to us when you visit our site, and which may be correlated with identity information in our log files.

When you visit our site, we log standard information such as your IP address, which is a number that can be used to identify your location and Internet Service Provider, along with the URL from which you came to our site and the URLs visited on our site. A URL is the full address of a Web site page, which may contain some personal or identifying information about the person who is viewing it. 

When we send messages to you or others, we may provide a URL link to the Evite site that contains an alphanumeric identifier, which allows us to identify the person to whom we sent the message so that we can personalize our content for that individual. 

Evite uses pixel tags to gather information about the e-mails we send to our registered users and to recipients of messages. Pixel tags are tiny graphic files, not visible to the human eye, that are included in our HTML-encoded e-mail messages. When such a message is opened in an HTML-capable e-mail program, the recipient's computer will access our server to retrieve the pixel tag file, allowing us to record and store, along with your e-mail address, the date and time the recipient viewed the invite or reminder, that the recipient's e-mail program is capable of receiving HTML-encoded e-mail, and other standard logging information. The pixel tag also may see or read cookies. For more information about cookies and how to disable their use, see the section below on "Use of Cookies." 

The information described above in the Section entitled "Information Collected" is referred to collectively in this policy as "Data." 

**Use of Information**

We use the collected Data to schedule events for you, to contact the recipients on your Evite list, and to operate the Evite service. In addition, we use the Data to provide personalized content, advertising, and commercial messages (collectively, "Content") to you. A valid e-mail address is required to provide our users with updated information regarding the events they are scheduling and to send Evite invitations and reminders at the user's request. Location information, such as your zip code, allows us to identify the default time for events that you have scheduled, and allows us to localize Content for you, among other things. Demographic and profile data is used to deliver Content to you. 

We may also use the Data to send you information about our company and to keep you informed of events happening in your area, as well as to inform you of products, services and special promotions which might be of interest to you. In addition, we may use your Data if we need to contact you regarding the use of our service. You may choose to stop receiving future communications from us; please see the Opt-Out section below.

Some of your Data also may be shared with our business partners (such as providing your e-mail address to a third party service provider solely for the purpose of sending our e-mail newsletters). A list of those third parties is available here. If you do not want your Data provided to other companies, please notify us at [ privacy@evite.citysearch.com](mailto:privacy@evite.citysearch.com). Please keep in mind that any information you provide in your Evitals™ profile or in other publicly available areas of the site is accessible to others, and can be collected and used by them.

Evite, in its sole discretion, may use the title of your Evite invitation in our "Event Ticker" or for other marketing purposes, but only if you have selected to do so by clicking "yes" on the Web page that appears after your invitation has been sent. Evite will not disclose your or other registered users' Data in the Event Ticker unless such information is contained within the title of your Evite invitation. Evite reserves the right not to include any Evite title in the Event Ticker. 

Evite may correlate your Data, including personally identifiable data, with information held by our advertising companies to target ads to Evite users most likely to be interested in them, improving both the users' experience and the effectiveness of the ads. For more information about our use of 3rd-party advertisers [click here](https://web.archive.org/html/partners/thirdparty.html). 

**Use of Guest Contact Information**

We use your guests' contact information to allow them to respond to and comment on your Evite invitation. At your request, we may send reminders to your guests and display their e-mail addresses to your other guests. We also may send a post-event e-mail to you and your guests. If you use our Reminders service, we use the information you provide in your Reminders to send it to you and others to whom you have requested it be sent. Except as stated in the Section on Disclosure of Data below, your guest's contact information will not be provided to third parties without your guest's consent. 

You may delete your e-mail address from the guest list by requesting to be removed from the guest list on the invitation page. Once your e-mail address is removed from the guest list, it will no longer be accessible to other guests (unless you are subsequently invited to another party, in which case your e-mail address will be accessible to guests of the new event). 

If you use our "Tell A Friend" service at http://evite.citysearch.com/TellAFriend/ShowPage, Evite will use the e-mail addresses you provide to send your friends a one-time communication to tell them about the site. Evite will only use the e-mail addresses you list to notify your friends about our service.

 **Disclosure of Data**

Evite may disclose your Data, the contents of your private communications, or the contact information of your guests if required to do so by law, or as otherwise stated in this policy, or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Evite; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Evite; or (3) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of its members or the public. Also, certain technical processing of e-mail messages and their content may be required to: (1) send and receive messages; (2) conform to connecting networks' technical requirements; (3) conform to the limitations of the Service; or (4) conform to other similar requirements. 

It is possible that as we continue to develop our Web site and our business, Evite and/or related assets might be acquired. In such a transaction, customer information may be transferred to the acquiring entity.

 **Collection of Information by Third Party Advertising Companies**

Evite works with third-party advertising companies to place banner ads on our site and in e-mail communications sent to our registered users and to recipients of invites, Reminders, and other communications related to the Evite service. Information about your visit to this site, such as number of times you have viewed an ad, may be used to serve ads to you on this site. Evite may correlate registered users' Data, including personally identifiable data, with information held by our advertising companies to target ads to Evite users most likely to be interested in them, improving both the users' experience and the effectiveness of the ads. The third-party advertising companies also may read or set cookies on your hard drive, use pixel tags, track which ads you have viewed, or collect other information about you. 

Third parties who offer services, banner ads, or promotions through our site also may independently collect information about our registered users, visitors to our Web site and recipients of our communications through cookies, pixel tags, checkout pages, or otherwise, and may independently send communications to you.

The privacy practices of advertisers and other companies who provide services or ads through our site are not covered by this privacy policy. Please contact those companies directly for more information about their privacy practices. A list of the companies who collect information about you by providing services or ads through our site is available here. This list does not include each particular company whose products or services are advertised on this site. If you wish to prevent those companies from setting cookies on your browser, you may set your browser to refuse cookies or to warn you before setting a cookie. Disabling cookies set by companies whose products or services are advertised on this site should not affect your ability to use this site.

 **Use of IP Addresses**

We use your IP Address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site and otherwise provide our service to you. IP addresses may be disclosed to a third party if Evite believes in good faith that the law or legal process requires it, or to protect the rights or property of Evite or others. In addition, we or our third-party advertising companies may use information derived from your IP address, such as conducting a reverse domain name lookup, in order to provide advertisements more tailored to your interests.

 **Use of Cookies**

We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, among other purposes. For your security, passwords saved using cookies will expire when you close your browser. You can always choose not to accept cookies through your browser's preference options, but you may not be able to use some of our services if you do not accept cookies. In addition, if you receive a cookie from Evite when you open an e-mail communication related to the service, you may delete the cookie and disable further cookies from Evite by [clicking here](https://web.archive.org/turnOffCookies?commd=doPop&popt=Policies). Please note that Evite must set one cookie to disable further cookies. 

As described in more detail above, we use outside ad companies to display ads through our service. These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad companies, and we do not have access to this information. Likewise, some of our partners may use cookies. We do not control their use of cookies nor have access to the information contained in or related to those cookies. Please contact those companies directly for more information about their privacy practices. A list of the companies who collect information about you by providing services or ads through our site is available [here](https://web.archive.org/html/partners/thirdparty.html).

 **Security**

This site has industry standard security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control and we make good faith efforts to store the information collected by the Evite service in a secure operating environment that is not available to the public, but we cannot guarantee complete security.
