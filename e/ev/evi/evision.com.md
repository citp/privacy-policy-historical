**How does 1-800 Contacts protect children's privacy?**

We are concerned about the safety of children when they use the Internet. Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, we will never request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13.

If we are aware that a subscriber is under the age of 13 and has registered without prior verifiable parental consent, we will remove his or her personally identifiable registration information from our files.

**What about links to other Internet sites and services?**

We may maintain links to other websites that are not under our control. These websites have their own policies regarding privacy, which you should review before visiting them. We have no responsibility for linked websites and provide these links solely for the convenience and information of our customers.

**How does 1-800 Contacts make sure my order information is secure?**

Protecting your order information is a priority for us. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your online order information.

More than 90% of Fortune 500 companies use SSL security to protect their sensitive personal and financial information. When you use our ordering page you can be assured that your sensitive personal information and financial transactions with us are encrypted, safe, and secure.

To check the security of your connection, look at the lower corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), the SSL is active and the server is secure. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When assessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from “http://” to “https://”.

**What is adware? What is spyware? Does 1-800 Contacts use adware or spyware?**

Adware is software that is installed on your computer that can, for example, create pop-up advertisements or cause your browser to be redirected to other websites. We do not participate in or use third-party services that use adware, such as Zango, Gator/Claria, whenu.com or ezula.com. We have determined that there are instances where this type of advertising could be construed as confusing for customers. Therefore, we work to ensure that these third-party adware services do not function on the 1-800 Contacts website, [www.1800contacts.com](http://www.1800contacts.com/). Spyware is also software that is installed on your computer that can, for example, record and transmit information regarding the websites you visit, or record or transmit your keystrokes to a third party. Spyware, like adware, is often installed without the knowledge of the person using the computer. We do not use spyware and we work to ensure that spyware does not function on the 1-800 Contacts website.
