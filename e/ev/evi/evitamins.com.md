**What information do we collect?**

To order a product, you will need to set up an account. To set up an account, we will need to know your name, email address, billing and shipping address, credit card number, and expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status. You will also be asked to create a special username and password so that you may access your account in the future (and so you don't have to re-enter all your information again). When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, we may ask for your name, address, and email address so we can administer the contest and notify winners. When you submit a "Contact" request or a "Nutritional Support" request via our website, we will need to know your name, email address and question, however we DO NOT store any of this information on file. We simply need this information so that we may respond to you and answer your question. After a response is given to you, your request information is destroyed. If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about a product offered on our site, we ask them for their friend’s name and email address. eVitamins will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. eVitamins does not store this information. It is only used for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. If a user chooses to submit a product review, we will need to know your name, email, review description and location so that we may store it to display with your review. You can choose not to have your name, email or location posted to your review, although we will still need to collect the information to keep on file with your review for internal records. If you are the first person to write a product review about a particular product, you automatically become eligible to enter our contest to receive a “$50 gift certificate”. We notify all the winners via email. Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.

**How do we use it?**

We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about new eVitamins services, important functionality changes to the Web site, special offers we think you'll find valuable and most importantly just to see how you are doing. If you never want to receive any announcements or special offers from us, email us at promotions@evitamins.com and tell us to remove your name. Or simply log into your account manager and update your communication preferences.

**How does eVitamins services protect customer information?**

To place an order on our site, your browser must except SSL. We use some of the strongest encrypting technology available to safely secure your information. We also protect customer information simply by **never** **selling,** **trading, loaning or renting your personal information to others (EVER!).** eVitamins is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.

**What about "cookies"?**

"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Our cookies may contain personally identifying information. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies. You will need to enable cookies on your web browser in order to complete the checkout process. Cookies on our site also allow us to maintain login information and session state. Cookies can help us track you across our website to show you the most relevent information to help enhance your shopping experience. Cookies are small pieces of information, limited to 4K that are stored as text files.

If you still do not wish to accept cookies, you can always complete your order by calling our toll-free number at 1-888-222-6056 between 9:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. Mon-Fri.

**Will eVitamins disclose the information it collects to outside parties?**

eVitamins does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others (EVER!). eVitamins may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will never include any personally identifying information. We use an outside shipping company to ship orders (FedEx, DHL, USPS, or UPS), and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies may receive personally identifiable information to help us process your order. These companies will not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. Your personal data will be stored on file for as long as your account is active. An account will become inactive if an order is not placed within 24 months using that account. If your account is inactive it will automatically be deleted from our records. To have your account deleted earlier then the required expiration period, simply email us at privacy@evitamins.com and tell us to delete your personal information. If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users’ personally identifiable information. This can usually be done at the account manager or by emailing our Customer Support Department at support@evitamins.com. Or, contact us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed at the bottom of this page. 

**What you should know!**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If, however, we are going to use users’ personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users by posting a notice on our Web site for 30 days and send all users email notification to have the option to have their information deleted. At eVitamins, we take great pride in serving you and helping you with ALL your health needs. We value the trust you place in us and we would never do anything to compromise this. If you have any questions, concerns, problems or whatever it may be, we want to know. You may call our toll-free number at 1-888-222-6056 if you live in the United States. If you live outside the United States, you may call (586)786-0405. Or you may email us at [support@evitamins.com](mailto:support@evitamins.com). If you wish to write us, our address is:
