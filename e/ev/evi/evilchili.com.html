  <p>THIS DOCUMENT SETS FORTH THE PRIVACY POLICY FOR  THE DYNAMIC MEDIA, LLC ("EVILCHILI.COM") WEBSITE WWW.EVILCHILI.COM  ("SITE"). EVILCHILI.COM VALUES THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY AND  IS COMMITTED TO THE PRIVACY OF ITS VISITORS. THIS PRIVACY POLICY SETS  FORTH EVILCHILI.COM'S PRIVACY POLICY FOR THE SITE, AND GOVERNS THE  MANNER IN WHICH EVILCHILI.COM COLLECTS, USES, MAINTAINS AND DISCLOSES  INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM USERS OF THE SITE. BY USING THE SITE, YOU  AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS  PRIVACY POLICY, DO NOT USE THE SITE IN ANY MANNER. THIS PRIVACY POLICY  DOES NOT GOVERN PRIVACY PRACTICES ASSOCIATED WITH OFFLINE ACTIVITIES OR  ACTIVITIES OCCURRING ON WEBSITES NOT UNDER EVILCHILI.COM'S CONTROL.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>The Information EvilChili.com Collects</h2>
  <p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong>.  During your interactions with the Site, such as when you register with  the Site, EvilChili.com may wish to collect information that personally  identifies who you are, such as your name, address, email address  and/or telephone number.</p>
  <p><strong>Anonymous Information</strong>.  EvilChili.com may collect non-personally-identifiable information during  your visit. Examples of non-personally-identifiable information may  include your Internet access provider, your computer's Internet  protocol (IP) address, information regarding your user profile, your  browser and operating system, the date and time of your visit, the  pages you visit, the address of any Site you linked from, and  aggregate, statistical data such as usage, traffic patterns and user  demographics based on your use of the Site. EvilChili.com collects  non-personally-identifiable information in order to, among other  things, provide you with or assist in the provision of information  through the Site, to maintain the performance of the Site, and to make  the Site more useful. EvilChili.com may also share this  non-personally-identifiable information in aggregated form with third  parties so that these third parties may provide you with more relevant  services and advertisements.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Parental Consent</h2>
  <p>In  the event you are under the age of 13, we will notify your parent or  guardian before we collect any personally identifiable information and  require that your parent or guardian affirmatively consent to such  collection (as well as our use and/or disclosure of such information)  in advance.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>EvilChili.com's Use and Disclosure of Collected Information</h2>
  <p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information Use</strong>.  EvilChili.com may collect personally identifiable information in order  to, among other things, provide you with the information and/or  services that you have requested through the Site. EvilChili.com retains  such personally identifiable information only for as long as is  necessary depending on the reason for your submission of such  personally identifiable information, and collects no more personally  identifiable information than is reasonably necessary to provide you  with the services for which such information is collected.</p>
  <p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information Disclosure</strong>.  EvilChili.com takes your privacy very seriously. EvilChili.com does not  sell or otherwise disclose any personally identifiable information to  any third parties other than: (i) as required by law; (ii) in the event  of a sale, merger, public offering, bankruptcy or other change in  control of EvilChili.com and/or the Site; or (iii) with your affirmative  consent at the time you provide such information. While collecting  personally identifiable information from Site users age 13 or older,  EvilChili.com may ask whether you would like to "opt in" and allow  disclosure of your personally identifiable information by EvilChili.com  to certain specifically identified third party partners of EvilChili.com  (collectively, "Partners"). In the event you opt in and allow such  disclosure, your personally identifiable information will only be  disclosed to the previously identified Partner(s).</p>
  <p><strong>Opting In Through Other Venues</strong>.  Please be advised that if you provide consent and allow EvilChili.com to  disclose your personally identifiable information through one  EvilChili.com venue (such as the Site), you will be deemed to have  "opted in" through all EvilChili.com venues.</p>
  <p><strong>Disclosure to Agents of EvilChili.com</strong>.  From time to time, EvilChili.com may share the information you provide  to EvilChili.com, including personally identifiable information, with  outside contractors, auditors, consultants, or others hired by  EvilChili.com to assist in providing financial or operational activities  on EvilChili.com's behalf including technical and processing services  and analysis of website performance. EvilChili.com informs these parties  about safeguarding personally identifiable information, and requires  them to use such personally identifiable information only for an  authorized purpose on behalf of EvilChili.com and consistent with this  Privacy Policy.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Electronically Produced Data</h2>
  <p><strong>Cookies</strong>.  EvilChili.com, like most standard website servers, may use cookies and  other tools to collect information about how you use the Site. A cookie  is a small, unique text file that a website can send to your computer  hard drive when you visit a site. EvilChili.com may use "session  cookies", which terminate when a user closes his or her browser, and/or  "persistent cookies", which remain on the user's computer until  manually deleted. Most web browsers can either alert you to the use of  cookies or refuse to accept cookies entirely. If you do not want  EvilChili.com to deploy cookies in your browser, you can set your  browser to reject cookies or to notify you when a website tries to put  a cookie on your computer. Rejecting cookies may affect your ability to  use the Site.</p>
  <p><strong>Action Tags</strong>. Like most  standard website servers, EvilChili.com may employ a software technology  called action tags (also known as "web beacons", "single pixel gifs",  "clear gifs" or "web bugs"), which collect information and help to  manage cookies, in order to gather information about Site usage. Action  tags help EvilChili.com identify and track the performance of web pages  on the Site, therefore allowing EvilChili.com to measure the performance  and quality of the Site and to manage Site content. In addition,  EvilChili.com may use action tags in emails. This allows EvilChili.com to  gauge the effectiveness of certain communications by showing, for  example, how many emails have been opened.</p>
  <p><strong>IP Addresses</strong>.  An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer when you  use the Internet. Like most standard website servers, EvilChili.com  collects IP addresses and other technical information about your  machine through your web browser such as your operating system, browser  type and referring URL for the purposes of, among other things, system  administration and to ensure the validity of user requests.</p>
  <p><strong>Log Files</strong>.  Like most standard website servers, EvilChili.com gathers certain  information automatically and store it in log files, which contain  information such as, among other things, IP addresses, browser type,  operating system, ISP, date/time stamps and referring pages. Among  other things, this information allows EvilChili.com to track statistics  and trends on an aggregate basis.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Maintenance of Information and Security</h2>
  <p>EvilChili.com  maintains physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the  confidentiality and security of any personally identifiable information  that you disclose to EvilChili.com. EvilChili.com utilizes what  EvilChili.com believes to be industry standard security measures to  protect the loss, misuse and alteration of personally identifiable  information under EvilChili.com's control, and EvilChili.com limits  access to your personally identifiable information within EvilChili.com  to those employees who need to know the personally identifiable  information to provide information, services and/or products to you.  However, due to the nature of the Internet, computer networks, systems  and other factors, no transmission of data over the Internet is  guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third  parties not under the control of EvilChili.com to intercept or access  transmissions or private communications unlawfully, regardless of  EvilChili.com's best intentions. As such, EvilChili.com cannot ensure or  warrant the security of any information you transmit to EvilChili.com,  including without limitation personally identifiable information.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Review or Correction of Person Information</h2>
  <p>An  adult may review, request corrections, ask that we delete, or refuse  further collection or use of the personally identifiable information  EvilChili.com collects from such adult or the child or children for  which such adult is the legal guardian. Such adult may do this by  contacting EvilChili.com using the contact information provided at the  end of this document. In the event EvilChili.com changes this Privacy  Policy to allow disclosure of personally identifiable information to  third parties, such adults will have the option to agree to the  collection and use of such child and/or adult information without  having to consent to the disclosure of such personally identifiable  information to third parties.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Other Information</h2>
  <p><strong>Consent to Receive Notices Via the Site</strong>.  By submitting any personally identifiable information to the Site (and,  for parents or guardians of children under the age of 13, submitting a  consent to EvilChili.com), you are agreeing that EvilChili.com may  deliver all privacy and opt out notices to you electronically,  including via email to the most recent email address you have provided  to EvilChili.com, or via posting on the Site.</p>
  <p><strong>Links</strong>.  The Site may contain links to third party sites at which your  personally identifiable information is collected and used. Your visit  to any third party website is governed by the privacy and other  policies applicable to that site. EvilChili.com cannot control nor is it  responsible for any such third party collection or use of your  personally identifiable information or the content or policies of such  sites, and EvilChili.com expressly disclaims any liability related to  such sites.</p>
  <p><strong>Web Logs and Other Forums</strong>.  The Site may offer web logs, web postings, bulletin boards, chat rooms,  newsgroups or other forums which permit users to interact online. Any  information you transmit online in such forums will be made public and  EvilChili.com cannot control nor is it responsible for the use any third  party may make of such information.</p>
  <p><strong>Privacy Policy Changes</strong>.  EvilChili.com reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any  time at its sole discretion. All Privacy Policy changes will be posted  on the Site and are effective immediately upon posting. Consequently,  you are advised to visit and review this Privacy Policy frequently. The  last date on which this Privacy Policy has been updated is noted below.</p>

  * This noscript section of this tag only shows image banners. There

  * information to the <img> tag.
  *
  * If you do not want to deal with the intricities of the noscript
  * section, delete the tag (from <noscript>... to </noscript>). On
  * average, the noscript tag is called from less than 1% of internet
