It gets deleted from your machine when you close your browser, and the information associated with it gets deleted within 4 hours of you leaving our site. We use a “permanent” cookie if you are a registered, logged-in user of the site, and opted to have us “Remember Login Info”. This is how we know who you are in the forums, and whether you want email from us (see below). We do not log the cookies in our web server logs.

As we said, we won’t sell this. If you bought something, we simply use it to ship that product to you. If you registered and gave us your email address, we may email you things (the daily strip, the monthly newsletter, etc.), but only if you checked the indicated box when you registered. To uncheck it, so we won’t email you stuff, you can do that at: http://www.evil-comic.com/users/info.html
