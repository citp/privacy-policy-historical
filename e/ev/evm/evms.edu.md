# EVMS Web Site Privacy Policy

**  
Web Site Privacy Statement**

EVMS Web sites can be visited without identifying yourself or revealing personal information. On occasion, we may ask you for personal information to help us better serve you. If you choose to provide us with personal information, it will be used only to support your customer relationship with EVMS. EVMS will not sell, rent or lease your personally identifiable information to anyone.

EVMS will not share your personal information with a business partner or any unrelated third party company unless you give your permission. We take seriously the trust you place in us.

**What We Collect**

On some EVMS Web sites, you will be able to request information and/or make appointment requests. In order to utilize these services, personal information will be requested, and may include your name, address, phone number(s), and email address, along with details related to your request.

We do not attempt to personalize our Web sites through the use of cookies or other analysis technologies such as Web beacons. We do collect total numbers of visits to our Web sites, but do not collect or store personal data.

**How We Use It**

EVMS uses the information you provide to respond to your request.

Links provided on EVMS Web sites to third party Web sites are provided as a convenience and EVMS does not control those sites or their privacy practices, which may differ from ours. EVMS does not endorse or make any representations about them. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any company before submitting your personal information. The personal data you choose to give to unrelated third parties is covered by their privacy policies, not the EVMS Privacy Policy.

**Security**

EVMS is committed to ensuring the security of your information. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of the information, EVMS has instituted technical, physical, and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. We use SSL encryption when collecting or transferring sensitive data such as personal identifying information.

**Contacting Us**

We value your comments and opinions. If you have comments or questions about our privacy policy, please email [webmaster@evms.edu](mailto:webmaster@evms.edu).
