**I. We Have a Legal Duty to Safeguard Your Medical Information** | Top  
At Eastern Virginia Medical School, Eastern Virginia Medical School Health Services, and Eastern Virginia Medical School Pediatric Faculty Associates (referred to as Eastern Virginia Medical School), we are committed to protecting your medical information. We create a record of care and services that you receive at Eastern Virginia Medical School. This record is important to provide you with quality care and to comply with legal requirements. We have an obligation to provide you with this notice about our privacy practices that explain how, when, and why we use and disclose your medical information. With some exceptions, we may not use or disclose any more of your medical information than is necessary to accomplish the purpose of the use or disclosure.

We are legally required to follow the privacy practices that are described in this notice. However, we reserve the right to change the terms of this notice and our privacy policies at any time. Any changes will apply to the medical information we already have. Before we make an important change to our policies, we will promptly change this notice and post a new notice. You may request a copy of this notice at any clinical department, or view a copy on our web site at www.evms.edu.  
  
**II. How We May Use and Disclose Your Medical Information** | Top  
We use and disclose your medical information for many different reasons. Below is the description of the different categories of uses and disclosures as well as some examples of each category. Not every use or disclosure in a category will be listed.

  1. **For treatment.** We may disclose your medical information to physicians, nurses, medical students, and other health care personnel who provide you with health care services or are involved in your care. For example, if you are being treated for a knee injury, we may disclose your medical information to a physical rehabilitation department in order to coordinate your care.
  2. **For payment.** We may use and disclose your medical information in order to bill and collect payment for the treatment and services provided to you. For example, we may provide portions of your medical information to our billing department and your health plan to get paid for health care services we provided to you. We may also provide your medical information to our business associates, such as billing companies, claims processing companies, and others that process our health care claims.
  3. **For health care operations.** We may disclose your medical information in order to operate the Health Services practice plan. For example, we may use your medical information in order to evaluate the quality of health care services, to evaluate the performance of the health care professionals, and for the teaching and training of health care personnel. We may also provide your medical information to our accountants, attorneys, consultants, and others in order to make sure we're complying with the laws that affect us.
  4. **When a disclosure is required** by federal, state or local law, judicial or administrative proceedings, or law enforcement. For example, we make disclosures when a law requires that we report information to specific government agencies and law enforcement personnel about victims of abuse, neglect, or domestic violence; when dealing with gunshot and other wounds; or when ordered in a judicial or administrative proceeding.
  5. **For public health activities.** For example, we report information about births, deaths and various diseases to government officials in charge of collecting that information. We provide coroners, medical examiners, and funeral directors necessary information relating to an individual's death. We are also required to report any situations where we cannot eliminate the possibility of child abuse or elder abuse.
  6. **For health oversight activities.** For example, we will provide information to assist the government when it conducts an investigation or inspection of a health care provider or organization.
  7. **For purposes of organ donation.** We may notify organ procurement organizations to assist them in organ, eye, or tissue donation and transplants.
  8. **For specific government functions.** We may disclose your medical information to military personnel in certain situations. We may also disclose medical information for national security purposes, such as conducting intelligence operations.
  9. **For worker's compensation purposes.** We may provide your medical information in order to comply with worker's compensation laws.
  10. **To avoid harm.** We may provide your medical information to law enforcement or persons able to prevent or lessen harm in order to avoid serious threat to the health or safety of a person or the public.
  11. **Appointment reminders and health-related benefits or services.** We may use your medical information to provide appointment reminders or give you information about treatment alternatives, or other heath care services or benefits we offer.
  12. **For research.** Under certain circumstances, we may use and disclose medical information about you for research purposes. For example, a research project may involve comparing the health and recovery of all patients who receive one type of medication to those who receive another medication, for the same condition. All research projects are subject to a special approval process. This approval process entails trying to balance the research needs with the patient's need for privacy of their medical information. We may disclose medical information about you to people preparing to conduct a research project, for example, to help them look for patients with specific medical needs, so long as the medical information they review does not leave Eastern Virginia Medical School facilities. We will almost always ask for your specific permission if the researcher will have access to your name, address or other information that reveals who you are, or will be involved in your care at Eastern Virginia Medical School.
  13. **Fundraising activities.** We may use your medical information to raise funds for our organization. The money raised through these activities is used to expand and support the health care services and educational programs we offer the community. We only would release contact information, such as your name, address and phone number and dates you received treatment or services at Eastern Virginia Medical School. If you do not want us to contact you for fundraising efforts, you must notify our Privacy Office in writing.

**We are not required to agree to your request.** If we accept your request, we will put any limits in writing and abide by them except in emergency situations. You may not limit the uses and disclosures that we are legally required or allowed to make.

To request a change to your medical information, your request and reason for the request must be in writing. We may deny your request for a change if it is not in writing or does not include a reason to support the request. We will respond within 60 days of receiving your request. We may deny your request in writing if you ask us to change information that:

    1. Is accurate and complete.
    2. Was not created by us, unless the person that created the information is no longer available to make the change.
    3. Is not a part of the information which you would be permitted to receive; or
    4. Is not a part of the medical information kept by or for us.

Our written denial will state the reasons for the denial and explain your right to file a written statement of disagreement with the denial. You have the right to request that your request and our denial be attached to all future disclosures of the medical information in question.
