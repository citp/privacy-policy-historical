                    <h4>Introduction</h4>
                    <p>eBike (part of the Brightside Group) is committed to both respecting your privacy and providing a secure website so your personal information is protected. You can be assured any information you provide to us will be used strictly in accordance with the terms laid out in this statement.</p>

                <li id="collecting-information">
                    <h4>Collecting Information</h4>
                    <p>We will only look to request necessary information from you and will only use and disclose this information in the course of arranging and administering your insurance, and to inform you of other services which we feel may be appropriate to you. The type of information we will collect will include, for example, your name and postal address, date of birth, telephone number, email address, credit/debit card details and bank account details. The information we hold will be, to the best of our knowledge, accurate and up to date. Under the Data Protection Act you have the right to see the personal information that we hold about you in our records. All personal information is treated confidentially and is safely stored on our computer, with security systems preventing unauthorised access.</p>

                <li id="confidentiality">
                    <h4>Confidentiality</h4>
                    <p>We will endeavour to treat all your personal information as private and confidential. Other than under the terms of this privacy statement we will not disclose any of your information to anyone. We would like to bring your attention to our obligations to disclose information in the following exceptional cases permitted by law.</p>
                    <p>These are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Where we are legally forced to.</li>
                        <li>Where there is a duty to the public to disclose information.</li>
                        <li>Where you have given permission to disclose information.</li>
                        <li>Where we have to protect our interest.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In the event that you have to make a claim then we will need to disclose information with any other parties involved in that particular claim. For example these parties may include the third party involved with the claim, the third party's insurer or the third party's solicitor. As highlighted in our Terms Of Business, your policy details will be added to the Motor Insurance Database (MID).</p>
                    <p>The MID is run by the Motor Insurers Information Centre (MIIC). MID data may be used by the DVLA and DVLNI for the purpose of Electronic Vehicle Licensing and by the Police for the purposes of establishing whether a driver's use of the vehicle is likely to be covered by a motor insurance policy and/or for preventing and detecting crime. If you are involved in an accident, the MID maybe used by Insurers, MIIC and the Motor Insurer's Bureau to identify relevant policy information. People pursuing a claim in respect of a road traffic accident may also obtain relevant information held on the MID. For more information visit <a href="http://www.mib.org.uk" target="_blank">www.mib.org.uk</a>. eBike will also pass information to the Claims and Underwriting Exchange Register which is run by Insurance Database Services Limited (IDS Ltd), and the Motor Insurance Anti-Fraud and Theft register, run by the Association of British Insurers (ABI). The aim is to help us to check information provided and also prevent fraudulent claims. When dealing with your request for insurance these registers maybe searched. When you inform us of an incident, we will pass this information relating to it to the registers.</p>

We are constantly reviewing and enhancing our technical and physical security procedures to protect your personal data from unauthorised access. The eBike site also uses 128-bit secure socket layer (SSL) encryption technology to encrypt sensitive information such as your financial information.
