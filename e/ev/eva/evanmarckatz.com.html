                          A "cookie" is a small text file that an Internet 
                          site can place on your computer's hard drive for record-keeping 
                          purposes. Cookies make using this site easier by, among 
                          other things, saving your passwords and preferences 
                          for you, keeping track of your shopping cart when you 
                          visit our online store or other similar purposes, and 
                          to help identify you whenever you return to our site, 
                          so you do not need to reenter your identification information.</p>
                        <p>Most Internet browsers are initially set up to accept 
                          cookies. However, you can reset your browser to refuse 
                          all cookies or to alert you when a cookie is being sent 
                          (note: you may need to consult your browser's "Help" 
                          area for instructions on how to do that). If you choose 
                          to disable your cookies setting or refuse to accept 
                          a cookie, some parts of this site will not function 
                          properly or may perform considerably slower. For example, 
                          without cookies, you will not be able to set personalized 
                          preferences or you may have difficulty completing shopping 
                          transactions, listening to music or playing games.</p>
