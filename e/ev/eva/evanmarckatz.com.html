                      <p>We at evanmarckatz.com respect the privacy concerns of the users of this site and have created this privacy policy to explain (1) what information we gather from you when you visit our site, (2) how we may use such information, (3) your choices concerning how we may use such information and (4) the security measures we take to protect such information. Some information is collected on this site automatically through our technology; other information is collected only when you choose to give it to us (e.g., when you purchase our services or sign up for a specific online transaction).</p>
                      <p><em><strong>Information We Gather Automatically</strong></em><br>
                        When you visit this site, certain non-personally identifying information is recorded automatically by the standard operation of our Internet servers. Information such as the type of browser being used, its operating system, and your computer’s Internet Protocol ("IP") address (a number that your Internet service provider assigns to your computer whenever you surf the Internet) is gathered in order to facilitate our online operations and to assure an efficient online experience for you. We may also use or share this information for security purposes, to generate group statistics about our user community, or as required by law.</p>
                      <p>We may use your IP address or other automatically recorded information, in cooperation with your Internet provider, to identify you if it is necessary to contact you or to bring legal action against you because you are violating the Terms and Conditions of use for this site or may be causing injury to or interference (intentionally or unintentionally) with our company’s rights or property, other users of this site or anyone else who could be harmed by your activities.</p>
                      <p>We allow third-party companies, including AddThis, to collect certain anonymous information when you visit our website. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information during your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or a third party web beacon to collect this information. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice, you can visit www.networkadvertising.org.</p>
                      <p><em><strong>Personal Information You Provide To Us</strong></em><br>
                        We may request personally identifying information from you in a variety of contexts. For example, you may provide such data to us if you: (1) purchase any products or services from evanmarckatz.com; (2) fill out an order form to request information; (3) register to participate in community features; or (4) complete an online registration form (e.g., various sign-up forms for receiving email newsletters, registering for special offers, registering for an account, entering a contest or responding to a survey).</p>
                      <p>In such cases, the personally identifying information we request may include your name, email address, mailing address and zip code, phone number, and, where appropriate, a valid credit card number with expiration date (collectively, "Personal Information"). In addition, we may collect other non-personally identifying information such as your date of birth, gender, country of residence, hobbies, interests and other information regarding your interaction with our site, preferences and other customized activities in which you participate. Of course, you never have to answer any of the questions we ask you or otherwise interact with our site and/or our consultants, but refusal to do so may limit the products or services we can offer or provide to you.</p>
                      <p><em><strong>How Can Your Personal Information Be Used?</strong></em></p>
                      <p><em>Within evanmarckatz.com</em><br>
                        When you purchase products or services from evanmarckatz.com, we will use your Personal Information to fulfill your order and for customer service. Many online customers are particularly concerned about their credit card information, which we will share only as required by companies involved in your transaction (e.g., fulfillment, billing, mailing, storage or delivery services). We will not share your credit card information with any other company unless it is involved in the fulfillment or delivery of your order. We do not rent, sell or share credit card information with promotional partners or other third parties.</p>
                      <p>We may use your Personal Information and other non-personally identifying information we collect to update you about our products or services or to contact you about offers of new evanmarckatz.com products or services that are of interest to you. You always have the option to receive fewer or no communications in the future from us by opting out. You may opt out by following the instructions included in the specific communication you no longer wish to receive or by sending an email to evan@evanmarckatz.com and explaining how you would like to modify your preferences.</p>
                      <p><em><strong>For Legal Enforcement Purposes</strong></em><br>
                        We reserve the right to disclose your Personal Information, including credit card information, as required by law or in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against you if you are violating the Terms and Conditions of use for this site or may be causing injury to or interference (intentionally or unintentionally) with our company’s rights or property, other users of this site or anyone else who could be harmed by your activities.</p>
                      <p><em><strong>Safeguarding Your Personal Information</strong></em><br>
                        evanmarckatz.com cares about the security of your Personal Information. We follow generally accepted industry security standards to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security and correctly use such Personal Information. However, unfortunately, despite many advances in information security technology and procedures, no commercially deployed method of information transfer over the Internet or electronic data storage is known to be 100% secure. As a result, while we do strive to use modern and commercially reasonable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of that information during its transmission or its storage in our systems.</p>
                      <p><em><strong>Cookies</strong></em><br>
                        A "cookie" is a small text file that an Internet site can place on your computer’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make using this site easier by, among other things, saving your passwords and preferences for you, keeping track of your shopping cart when you visit our online store or other similar purposes, and to help identify you whenever you return to our site, so you do not need to reenter your identification information.</p>
                      <p>Most Internet browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. However, you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to alert you when a cookie is being sent (note: you may need to consult your browser’s "Help" area for instructions on how to do that). If you choose to disable your cookies setting or refuse to accept a cookie, some parts of this site will not function properly or may perform considerably slower. For example, without cookies, you will not be able to set personalized preferences or you may have difficulty completing shopping transactions, listening to music or playing games.</p>
