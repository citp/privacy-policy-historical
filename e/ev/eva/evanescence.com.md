# Wind-up Entertainment, Inc. - Privacy Policy

  
We are committed to protecting the privacy and security of the users of our sites.  
This privacy policy (the "Policy") governs our use of information collected online only and does not apply to any information we may collect offline.

This Policy informs you of how we use and protect your personal information and about what choices you have concerning our use of such information. Please read this Policy carefully. We reserve the right to change this Policy from time to time in order to address new issues and reflect changes on our sites. We will post any changes on this page so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose that information to anyone. Please refer back to this Policy regularly.

If you have any questions or concerns about this Policy, please send us e-mail to: [privacy@wind-upent.com](mailto:privacy@wind-upent.com).

  
WE WILL NOT KNOWINGLY COLLECT ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM ANY PERSON UNDER THE AGE OF 13. PERSONS UNDER THE AGE OF 13 ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN WIND-UP'S STREET TEAMS.

Note to Parents: We urge all parents to participate in their children's exploration of the Internet and any online services, and to teach their children about protecting their personal information while online. If you have any concerns about Wind-up's websites, street teams or related services, please e-mail: [privacy@wind-upent.com](mailto:privacy@wind-upent.com).

  
We will only collect personally identifiable information from you (such as your full name, street address, telephone number, credit card number and e-mail address) that you voluntarily submit to us in connection with your use of the site, such as in connection with participation in our street teams, contests, sweepstakes, e-news lists, games, surveys, forums, subscription registrations, content submissions, chats, bulletin boards, discussion groups, requests for suggestions, visitors' requests for free products or services or additional information, and other activities, services or resources we make available on any of our sites. Except as described in this Policy, we will never intentionally disclose any personally identifiable information about you as an individual user to any third party without having received your permission. 

If you do provide us with personally identifiable information, we may use it to conduct the activities described above, to respond to your questions or comments, to contact you to confirm your registration, to contact you about your account, or to contact you regarding changes to the Wind-up Sites' Terms and Conditions and this Privacy Policy.

If you give us permission, we may also use personally identifiable information for internal or external marketing and promotional purposes. On occasion, for example, we may send you e-mails to introduce a product or service that we think might be of interest to you. For us to obtain your permission to send you this information, we will give you an opportunity to "opt-in" when you provide your personal information. If you do "opt-in," you may choose to "opt-out" at any time, even after you have provided personal information, by following the procedures set forth below at the end of this Policy. Please note, however, that under certain circumstances, if you initially do not choose to "opt-in," the change may not be retroactive, or if you later "opt-out," you may not be eligible for certain benefits for which a name, e-mail address, telephone number or other personal identification information is needed.

We may use third party service providers to help us operate our business and the Site or administer activities on our behalf, such as sweepstakes administration. We may share your information with these third parties for those limited purposes.

We will release specific information about you or your account to comply with any valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute or court order. We will also release specific information in special cases, such as if there is an attempted breach of the security of the sites, or a physical threat to you or others. If Wind-up is sold to, or merges with, another company, or declares bankruptcy, some or all of the information collected from you may be transferred to a third party as a result of the transfer of assets.

Please note that if you give out personal information online -- for example, through a message board or chat room -- that information can be collected and used by third parties. Although we strive to protect our users' privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of information you post in these forums. You disclose such information at your own risk.

  
We may collect non-personal identification information through the use of "cookie" technology and/or IP address tracking. Most browsers are set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you do so, please note that some parts of the Wind-up Sites, such as message boards, chats, shopping, contests, and game areas, may not function properly. Non-personal identification information might include the browser you use, the type of computer, the operating systems, the Internet service providers, and other similar information. Our system also automatically gathers information about the areas you visit on our sites and about the links you may select from within our site to other areas of the World Wide Web or elsewhere online.

We may use information in the aggregate to understand how our users as a group use the services and resources provided on our sites. This way we know which areas of our sites are favorites of our users, which areas need improvement, and what technologies are being used so that we may continually improve our sites. We may share this aggregate statistical information with our partners, suppliers and other third parties, but we will not share any individual names, personal navigational or other personal information.

We may also collect demographic information that you provide to us, such as your zip code, age or income level. We use your demographic information to tailor the site to your interests. We may share demographic information on an aggregate non-identifiable basis with third parties. Although we do not at the present time, we may, at some time in the future, have advertisers with display ads on our sites that solicit or contain technology to collect information about our users for the advertisers, but we will not permit such advertisers to collect any personal information from our users within our sites.  
  
Users will find advertising or other contents on our sites that link to the sites and services of our partners, suppliers, advertisers, sponsors, licensors, and other third parties. In many cases, the links represent cooperative projects or are mutual links established with persons or entities connected with our sites. Although we initially visit the sites or services that are so linked, we do not control the contents or links that appear on these sites and are not responsible for their content or privacy practices. In addition, these sites or services, including their contents and links, may be constantly changing. These sites and services may have their own privacy policies and customer service policies, or no policy (policies) at all. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third party sites or services before providing any of them with your personal information.

  
Although we take careful measures to secure both your information and our physical premises, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet and our efforts in this regard must necessarily be limited by what is practical in light of our equipment and technology.

  
If you would like to review or edit any personal information we have retained about you in our database, visit the [User Profile](http://www.winduplist.com/) section of our site or send an email to [privacy@wind-upent.com](mailto:privacy@wind-upent.com).

  
If you "opt-in" to receive information from Wind-up or others, you can change your mind later. If at any time you would like to stop receiving such information, you can let us know by sending an e-mail stating your preference to [privacy@wind-upent.com](mailto:privacy@wind-upent.com).

  
By using any of the Wind-up sites, you signify your acceptance of this Policy. If you do not agree to this Policy, please do not use our sites. Your continued use of the Wind-up Sites following the posting of changes to this Policy will be deemed your acceptance of those changes.
