**ETTU PRIVACY POLICY**

This page summarises the privacy policy and practices of the European Table Tennis Union hereunder referred as ETTU. The ETTU Privacy Policy has been established to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU) 2016/679. The policy is subject for updates and amendments.

**What kind of information is collected?**

If you visit the ETTU website to browse, read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain information about the visit. The following information is automatically collected and stored:

  * The Internet Protocol address will be saved anonymous so there is no access on further relating information. We make no attempt to link these addresses with the identity of individuals visiting;
  * Information relating to your computer system, such as the type of browser and operating system, language used, and demographic information such as global location;
  * The date and time of the visit; and
  * The web pages or services accessed.



Information collected automatically in this manner is used for purposes such as assessing system performance, improving web services, improving website management and determining best content for our visitors, partners and sponsors. The ETTU website does not automatically gather any specific personal information from you, such as your name, phone number, or email address. We only obtain personal information in a manner where you provide consent.

**What safeguards are in place?**

The ETTU website makes reasonable security arrangements to protect your personal information against such risks as unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, or disposal. Security measures have been integrated into the design, implementation, and day-to-day operating practices as part of the ETTU’s continuing commitment to the protection of personal information it holds.

**Cookies**

The ETTU uses "cookies" to track how our visitors use this site, demographics on their systems, languages, global locations, and sites previously visited or to determine which site content most appropriately fits our visitors, such as topic specific content. The cookies are not used to identify individuals. Cookies can be disabled or denied in your web browser settings with minimal impact on your ability to access information from this site. However, many other websites will not function properly without them.

They are created when you visit a website that uses cookies and are stored in the memory or hard drive. They are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information about the visitor’s experience and interests.

The Google Analytics' features that the ETTU has implemented are based on Display Advertising (e.g., Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration, or Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting). Visitors can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customise Google Display Network ads using the Ads Settings, which can be found here: [ **https://www.google.com/settings/ads**](https://www.google.com/settings/ads)

The ETTU will not facilitate the merging of personally-identifiable information with non-personally identifiable information previously collected from Display Advertising features that is based on the DoubleClick cookie unless we have obtained a visitor's prior consent to that data merger.

Visitors can also make use of the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, which can be found here:  **<https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/>**
