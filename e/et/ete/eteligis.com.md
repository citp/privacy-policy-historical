 **Does Eteligis.com use cookies or similar tools?**

Yes, however, Eteligis only uses cookies to facilitate functions at the Eteligis websites and does not record or store any information about your movements on the Internet outside the Eteligis websites.

Eteligis.com also uses services provided by the News Registry. The News Registry collects content usage information and may use cookies in conjunction with this activity. Your continued readership of the Site means you accept the privacy policy of the News Registry. Please refer to the News Registry privacy policy at http://www.newsregistry.com/privacycenter/servicepolicy.aspx   for further information.

In addition, Eteligis.com uses web beacons. Web beacons are used to understand website traffic patterns and the number of visitors to our website or other sites containing news distributed by Eteligis and to collect aggregate data reported to clients in measurement reports in order to measure the effectiveness of their press releases.

Please note that if you click on a link to a third-party website from Eteligis.com, the linked-to site may have different policies and practices with regard to cookies and Eteligis has no control over and is not responsible for such policies or practices. You should always consult the privacy policy governing any web site you visit on the internet for complete information about their policies and practices.

 **What security measures does Eteligis take to safeguard its online users' privacy?**

Information you submit at Eteligis.com upon registration for specific services is password-protected so that the only parties who have access to the information besides Eteligis and its agents and affiliates are the member entity and its employees. In addition, individual employees of members will receive individual passwords when they log-on to submit press releases online, and information submitted using Eteligis.com is further protected by Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the information during transmission.

In order to protect the integrity of the password system, members should refrain from disclosing passwords and immediately change any passwords that may have been compromised.

Eteligis will never ask you for your password by e-mail, so members and their employees should not respond to unsolicited e-mail requests asking for password information even if such requests appear to be from Eteligis.

Please be advised that no data transmission over the internet is 100% secured. Eteligis is committed to protecting users' personal information, but cannot guarantee or warrant the security of this information when it is sent to or through Eteligis.com. Transmission of such information is therefore at the risk of the user.

 **Usernames and Passwords**

Users may register via Eteligis.com. Once usernames and passwords (the "Login Information") are issued to users (the "Authorized Users"), the Authorized Users accept full responsibility for the use of the Login Information. The Authorized User may not, under any circumstances, release their Login Information to any other person for any reason, and is required to keep the Login Information strictly confidential. If any breach of security, theft or loss, or unauthorized disclosure of the Login Information occurs, the Authorized User must immediately notify Eteligis of such security breach.

 **Privacy policy updates**

This policy will be updated from time to time as necessary to address new or modified services and functions. Eteligis will provide you with notice of any changes or updates to this policy at the home page of Eteligis.com.
