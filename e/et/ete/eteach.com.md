This would only apply when individuals are applying for roles in overseas international schools and is done at the request of the candidate.

_If you do not wish to provide us with necessary  data_

There may be circumstances where we require you to provide data which is necessary in order for us to meet statutory or contractual obligations, or perform our Recruitment Services. If you do not wish to provide us with information we request then please notify us. However, please be aware that as a result we may be unable to provide you or the party who you represent with a Recruitment Service, and in some cases may result in a breach of the contract we have with you or a third party you represent.

**_Group companies transfer_**

Although this Privacy Notice applies to us your data may be accessible to, and shared with other organisations within our branch offices and our subsidiary companies of Eteach UK Ltd for any of the purposes set out within this Privacy Notice, or where we have shared administration systems and staff.

In the event  of a sale, merger, liquidation, receivership or the transfer of all or part of our assets to a third party, we may need to transfer your information to a third party.

**_Retaining your data_**

In most circumstances your data will not be retained for more than 6 years from the last point at which we provided any services or otherwise engaged with you and it is our policy to only store your personal  data for as long as is reasonably necessary for us to comply with our legal obligations and for our legitimate business interests. However, we may retain data for longer than a 6 year period where we have a legal or contractual obligation to do so, or we form the view that there is otherwise a continued basis to do so, for example where your personal information identifies specialist skill sets which may remain in demand, or we are subject to a legal obligation which applies for a longer period.

If however you believe that we should delete your personal data at an earlier date, please inform us in writing of your reasons.  Please see Section 4 'Your Rights' below.

  * Request that we restrict processing of your data in certain circumstances
  * Request that data is erased where the continued use of that data cannot be justified
  * Object to any decision, which significantly affects you, being taken solely by a computer or via another automated process
  * Withdraw your consent to our processing of your personal data for a particular purpose at any stage.

Our processing in that respect will be limited to what is necessary in furtherance of those interests or obligations
  * Request that inaccurate or incomplete data is rectified
  * Request that data provided directly by you and processed by automated means is transferred to you or another controller; this right only being applicable where our processing of your data is based either on your consent or in performance of a contract

Please note that should you exercise your right to request that we erase data or cease any processing activity, we may retain a record of this request and the action taken in order to both evidence our compliance, and to take steps to minimise the prospect of any data being processed in the future should it be received again from a third party source.

If you have any questions concerning your rights or should you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact [gdpr@eteach.com](mailto:gdpr@eteach.com).

**Complaints**

If you are dissatisfied about any aspect of the way in which your data is processed you may, in the first instance refer the matter to [gdpr@eteach.com](mailto:gdpr@eteach.com). This does not affect your right to make a complaint to the Information Commissioner's Office.
