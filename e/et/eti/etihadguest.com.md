#### Personalized account

We may invite you to provide additional information about your travel preferences, next of kin, dietary requirements, personal interests and any related reward scheme memberships that you may have. You don't need to provide this information to open an account, but it helps us to provide a more personalized service and makes it quicker to process travel bookings and mileage redemptions. 

#### Earning and Redeeming miles

If you make a qualifying purchase with Etihad Airways or one of our other carefully-chosen network of international and local travel, financial services, leisure and lifestyle [partners](http://www.etihadguest.com/en/earn-miles/) (" **Partners** "), or otherwise quote your membership of the Etihad Guest programme, they will provide information to us about the purchase or card activity so we can log it to your account. We do this to ensure you are awarded appropriate miles, help the Partner to validate any benefits you are claiming as well as other service delivery and marketing purposes. If you have an Etihad co-branded credit card, debit card or another financial product, we will also collect and process transactional and activity data associated with such products.

Together with our Partners, we offer you the chance to redeem your miles through our Reward Shop. Where you choose to redeem miles through the Reward Shop, we may ask you for additional information to redeem the benefit. In many cases, we will transfer you to the Partner to complete the relevant transaction. For example, if you choose to redeem miles for a holiday offered by Etihad Holidays, once you have claimed the miles on the Reward Shop, we will put you in touch with Etihad Holidays who will then make arrangements to complete the holiday booking.

Any additional information that has been provided to complete a redemption will be governed by the terms and conditions and privacy policy of the relevant merchant who is responsible for providing the product or service which you are purchasing through the Reward Shop. Merchant details _(including any terms and conditions)_ are clearly displayed at the point of redemption.
