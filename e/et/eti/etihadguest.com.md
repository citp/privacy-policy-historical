### Information we collect

**Membership  
** When you join Etihad Guest, we will collect details from you to set up your Etihad Guest account and allow you to start collecting and spending reward points. This will include your name, date of birth and contact details _(such as your address, email and phone number)_ and details of any linked family accounts. We will also ask you to set up a user name and password.

_Where you are asking us to link family members to a single account, it is your responsibility to ensure each family member understands how we will use their personal information and obtain their consent to using their details in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We will assume that you have done this.  _

**Personalized account  
** We may invite you to provide additional information about your travel preferences, next of kin, dietary requirements, personal interests and any related reward scheme memberships that you may have. You don't need to provide this information to open an account, but it helps us to provide a more personalized service and makes it quicker to process travel bookings and mileage redemptions.

**Earning and Redeeming miles  
** If you make a qualifying purchase with Etihad Airways or one of our other carefully-chosen network of international and local travel, leisure and lifestyle [partners](https://web.archive.org/en/earn-miles/) (" **Partners** "), or otherwise quote your membership of the Etihad Guest programme, they will provide information to us about the purchase or card activity so we can log it to your account. We do this to ensure you are awarded appropriate miles and help the Partner to validate any benefits you are claiming.

Together with our Partners, we offer you the chance to redeem your miles through our Reward Shop. Where you choose to redeem miles through the Reward Shop, we may ask you for additional information to redeem the benefit. In many cases, we will transfer you to the Partner to complete the relevant transaction. For example, if you choose to redeem miles for a holiday offered by Etihad Holidays, once you have claimed the miles on the Reward Shop, we will put you in touch with Etihad Holidays who will then make arrangements to complete the holiday booking.

Any additional information that has been provided to complete a redemption will be governed by the terms and conditions and privacy policy of the relevant merchant who is responsible for providing the product or service which you are purchasing through the Reward Shop. Merchant details _(including any terms and conditions)_ are clearly displayed at the point of redemption.

**Events and promotions  
** From time to time we hold events and special promotions to introduce Etihad Guest to new members. If you come to one of these events, or take part in a promotion, we may ask for your personal details to help us run the promotion and keep in touch with you about Etihad Guest services that think may be of interest to you. Any information which you provide will be kept in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy and you can unsubscribe from further communications from us at any time.

**Customer support and online services  
** If you contact us with a query or comment about any of our services, or would like us to keep you informed about latest news and developments at Etihad Guest, we will need to collect information about you _(including your contact details)_ to help us respond to your query or request. We may do this when you can call our customer support centre, or interact with us through our online support tools.

We may also keep a record of any communications we have with you _(including a recording of any calls you make)_. We do this to help monitor and improve the quality of our customer support services. Where you have asked to receive an information update from us, you are free to change your preferences.

We take all reasonable steps to protect your personal information but cannot guarantee the security of any data you disclose to us via email or online.
