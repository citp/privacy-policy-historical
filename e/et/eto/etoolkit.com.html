      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are anti-spam and will not be renting or revealing your
identity to spammers.
<br><br>
As you notice, we don't make you jump through demographic hoops:
we don't ask for your name, address, age, household income, or
gender.  We don't collect this data. Therefore, we cannot abuse
that data.
<br><br>
Our newsletters are designed to provide you with free content
and special offers.  Period.
<br><br>
Your email address is revealed to our third-party mailing list
provider: <a href="http://www.topica.com">Topica.com</a>. They
are a great company with a strong anti-spam policy but you may
want to review their privacy policy as well.
<br><br>
In addition, we have an affiliate program that tracks traffic
sent from our affiliates' websites.  We pay them based on leads
(actual subscribers) so you may be tracked by cookies so that we
can pay our affiliates for valid leads. Again, your email address
isn't revealed to our affiliates but is collected by our third-
party affiliate program administrator: <a href="http://www.cj.com">Commission Junction</a>. 
They are also a respectable company with a strong anti-spam
policy but you may want to review their privacy policy as well.
<br><br>
Also, we monitor our traffic to determine what search engines,
links, and ad campaigns are sending us traffic.  Cookies may be
involved.  We may be tracking your movement on our site to
determine what percentage of people from certain ad campaigns and
links are actually signing up.  This helps us spend our advertising
and marketing budget more wisely. Again, none of your information
is being collected in a way to be reconciled with your email
address.
<br><br>
We are advertiser-supported so pay attention to banners and links
placed on our site and newsletters.  We do try to label most of
these as "Sponsor." We don't reveal your email address to our
advertisers but once you leave our newsletter or site, you are on
your own.
<br><br>
We only want to bring you respectable sponsors but occasionally
we participate in ad networks or have ads placed by third-parties
to whom we don't know. As such, be prudent and remember the
adage: buyer beware.
<br><br>
Also, we do reserve the right to sell some or all of our
newsletters to respectable content providers who agree to provide
you with like-minded content.  For example, if we agree to sell
our freebies' newsletter, we would only sell the email addresses
on that newsletter to a respectable company that agrees to
send you free content on the subject matter you selected:
freebies and free offers.
<br><br>
Children (defined as those under the age of 13 years old) may not
use DayTips without their parent's permission.
<br><br>
We also reserve the right to change or amend this privacy policy
in the future (and if our lawyers make us).
<br><br>
Advice: Freebies and sweepstakes are not free when you are asked to give
away your most valuable asset: your personal data.  Play it safe
and only provide that information for which you feel comfortable
giving.
