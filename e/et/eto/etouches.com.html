<h3>Our commitment to data security</h3>
<p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy,  and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place  appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard  and secure the information we collect online.      We are fully compliant with the US Department of Commerce “Safe  Harbor” initiative (as described below) outlining appropriate use and  storage of personal data for both US and European standards.      We never use or share the personally identifiable information  provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above  without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise  prohibit such unrelated uses.</p>
<h3>EU safe harbor privacy statement</h3>
<h3>General information</h3>
<p>This section describes how we collect, use, and  disclose EU personal information, which is certain personally  identifiable information that we receive in the United States about  individuals resident in the European Union. We comply with the US-EU  Safe Harbor Privacy Principles as set forth by the U.S. Department of  Commerce, with respect to the collection, use, and retention of data  from the EU. Compliance with the Principles may be limited, however in  certain cases to the extent necessary to meeting national security,  public interest or law enforcement requirements.     For further background and information about the EU Safe Harbor,  please refer to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s website at  http://export.gov/safeharbor.</p>
<h3>Notice</h3>
<p>We collect personal information from you via etouches  websites and etouches-Powered registration sites for the purposes of (a)  providing etouches Services; (b) facilitating communications between  you and third parties; (c) our marketing activities; and (d) all credit  and other financial checks in relation to any payments made by you for  etouches Services.</p>
<p>We may disclose personal information to third parties  when such disclosure is necessary or appropriate for the provision of  services to our clients or otherwise for the operation of our business.  We may also disclose personal information to third parties in  circumstances described in the “Onward Transfer to Third Parties”  section below.</p>
<p>Any complaints or questions should be first sent to us by email at <a href="mailto:privacy@etouches.com">privacy@etouches.com</a>. We will respond to personal information change requests within 30 days of receiving such requests.</p>
<p>When we receive personal information from the EU merely  for processing purposes and do not control the collection of the  personal information, we may not provide notification of this EU Safe  Harbor Privacy Statement to you. In such event, we reserve the right to  process personal information in the course of providing etouches  Services to our clients or otherwise for the operation of our business  without your knowledge.</p>
<h3>Choice</h3>
<p>Except as provided below, we give you the opportunity  to opt out from allowing us to disclose personal information to a third  party or to use it for a purpose incompatible with the purpose for which  it was originally collected. For sensitive personal information, we  require you to affirmatively opt in and give consent if the data is to  be disclosed to a third party or used for a purpose other than its  original purpose.</p>
<p>If you wish to opt-out you should contact us by email at <a href="mailto:privacy@etouches.com">privacy@etouches.com</a>.  If we wish to collect sensitive personal information you will be  advised of how to opt in and give the required consent at the time the  data is collected, if the data is to be disclosed to a third party or  used for a purpose other than its original purpose.</p>
<p>When we receive personal information merely for  processing purposes and do not control the collection of the personal  information, we may not provide such choices to you.</p>
<h3>Onward transfer to third parties</h3>
<p>We may disclose personal information to a third party  if (a) we have received your permission to make the disclosure, (b) the  disclosure is required by law, (c) the disclosure is reasonably related  to the sale or other disposition of all or part of etouches’ business,  (d) the information in question is publicly available, and/or (e) the  disclosure is reasonably necessary for the establishment of a legal  claim.</p>
<p>Additionally, we may disclose personal information to a  third party if the disclosure is to an etouches affiliate or to persons  or entities providing services on our behalf or an etouches client,  consistent with the purpose for which the information was obtained, if  the transferee, with respect to the personal information in question (a)  is subject to law providing an adequate level of privacy protection  (e.g. transferees that are located within the EU), (b) has agreed in  writing to provide an adequate level of privacy protection, and/or (c)  subscribes to the US-EU Safe Harbor Privacy Principles.</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>We take security measures designed to protect against  unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or  destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data  collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as  well as physical security measures designed to guard against  unauthorized access to systems where we store personal information.</p>
<p>We restrict access to personal information to etouches  employees, contractors, customers and partners who need to know that  information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These  individuals and third parties are bound by confidentiality obligations  and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal  prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>
<h3>Data integrity</h3>
<p>We take reasonable steps to ensure that personal  information is reliable, accurate, complete, current and relevant for  the purposes for which it was collected.</p>
<h3>Access</h3>
<p>Upon request and consistent with any applicable client  commitments, we will permit you to access your personal information and  to correct any erroneous information. You may need to provide sufficient  identifying information (e.g. name, address, birth date, and social  security or national health insurance or an equivalent number). Such  access may be denied or limited by us if providing such access is  unreasonably burdensome, expensive under the circumstances, and/or if in  giving such access would violate another person’s rights. In some  circumstances, we may charge a reasonable fee for access to personal  information. You can contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@etouches.com">privacy@etouches.com</a> to request access to change personal information.</p>
<h3>Enforcement</h3>
<p>We will conduct an annual self-assessment to ensure  that this Statement is published and disseminated within etouches and on  our website and that it conforms to the US-EU Safe Harbor Privacy  Principles. In addition, we have deployed internal processes to monitor  etouches’ compliance with the US-EU Safe Harbor Privacy Principles and  to address all questions or complaints. We will also self-certify  annually with the U.S. Department of Commerce as being in compliance  with the US-EU Safe Harbor Privacy Principles.      Users may raise any concerns or complaints regarding their personal  information directly with etouches by first contacting us by email at <a href="mailto:privacy@etouches.com">privacy@etouches.com</a>.   If you raise a concern or complaint, we will investigate the matter  and attempt to resolve all issues to your satisfaction.</p>
<h3>What if you do not get a satisfactory response</h3>
<p>We will try our best to see that you will always get a  satisfactory response from us. If you do not believe that we have  responded in a satisfactory manner, then we will agree to a process of  arbitration conducted by the American Arbitration Association.</p>
<h3>How to contact us</h3>
<p>If you have inquiries or concerns about any information we may have collected about you, please send us an email at <a href="mailto:privacy@etouches.com">privacy@etouches.com</a>.</p>
