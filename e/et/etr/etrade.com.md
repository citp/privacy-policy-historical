**Privacy Statement**

* * *

This Privacy Statement covers the following **affiliated companies** in the E*TRADE Financial family of companies: E*TRADE Financial Corporation., E*TRADE Securities LLC (member FINRA/SIPC), E*TRADE Capital Markets, LLC (member FINRA/SIPC), E*TRADE Capital Management, LLC (SEC RIA), E*TRADE Insurance Services, Inc., E*TRADE Financial Corporate Services, Inc., E*TRADE United Bank (member FDIC), E*TRADE Bank (member FDIC), E*TRADE Clearing LLC (member NYSE/FINRA/SIPC), E*TRADE Savings Bank (member FDIC), and E*TRADE Mortgage Corporation. These entities are collectively referred to as "affiliated companies," "we," "us," and "our" throughout this statement.

**Privacy is our priority.**

* * *

We are committed to protecting our consumers' personal and financial information. In the course of providing financial products and services, we need to collect and maintain certain nonpublic personal information. This Privacy Statement answers some questions about what nonpublic personal information we collect, what we do with it, and how we protect it. 

We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about our consumers to any nonaffiliated third parties, except as described below. 

**What types of nonpublic personal information do we collect?**

* * *

When you apply for, open, or maintain an account with us, or when you agree to allow us to provide personalized advisory services, or apply for a financial product or service (such as a loan), we collect the following types of information: 

  * Information you provide online and on applications or other forms, or through discussions we have with you or your representatives, such as your name, address, Social Security number, date of birth, income, employment information, investment experience, and risk tolerance, and any information about your personal goals or objectives.
  * Information about your transactions with or through us, such as your account balance, trading activity, loan amount, and account history, if applicable.
  * Information about you from consumer-reporting agencies, such as your credit scores.
  * Information you provide us about your external financial accounts in order for us to provide you special product and service features.



Information regarding external financial accounts will not be disclosed to any other entities, including our corporate affiliates. However, other above-referenced information may be disclosed, as permitted by law, in the manner described below. 

**What types of nonpublic personal information do we disclose?**

* * *

We may disclose nonpublic personal information we collect, such as the categories described above, primarily to make available to you the financial products and services that we and our business partners provide. We do not disclose nonpublic personal information about former customers to anyone, except as permitted by law or to cooperate with regulators or law enforcement authorities. 

**To what types of entities do we disclose nonpublic personal information?**

* * *

We may disclose nonpublic personal information to the following entities: 

  * among our **affiliated companies** (please see below to see how you may limit the sharing of some of this information for purposes of marketing by our affiliated companies);
  * with nonaffiliated third parties that perform services, such as marketing or market research, on our behalf (e.g., we may provide your name, address, phone number, and/or e-mail address to vendors who send our e-mail or regular mail);
  * with companies that service, maintain, or process for us your transactions and accounts (e.g., we provide information to companies that prepare and mail account statements and transaction confirmations);
  * with nonaffiliated third parties as permitted by or required by law, or to cooperate with regulators or law enforcement authorities (e.g., government/regulatory organizations, such as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as well as any of the securities exchanges, self-regulatory organizations and states we are registered with and to parties under court order or subpoena that request this information); and 
  * with nonaffiliated third parties for which you have provided your express consent or directed us to make.



We require that all the above entities with which we share your nonpublic personal information, agree to keep your information confidential. We also prohibit them from using or disclosing your information except for the limited purpose and to the persons for whom disclosure was intended, or as otherwise permitted by law. 

**How may you limit (opt-out of) the sharing of your information?**

* * *

The law allows you to opt-out of our **sharing** nonpublic personal information about you in certain circumstances with **nonaffiliated third party companies;** that is, you may direct us to not make such disclosures. However, we do not currently share information about you with any nonaffiliated third party that triggers this opt-out right. Accordingly, there is no need for you to opt-out or take any other affirmative action telling us not to share such information with nonaffiliated third parties. 

The law also allows you to opt-out of our **sharing** certain nonpublic personal information about you (e.g., information other than your transactions and experiences with us such as your credit report) among our **affiliated companies;** that is, you may direct us to not make such disclosures. But, we only share your transactions and experiences information (e.g., account balance, trading activity, loan amount, and account history) with our affiliated companies. Therefore, there is no need for you to exercise such opt-out right. 

Finally, the law also gives you the right to limit some kinds of **marketing** from our **affiliated companies.** You may elect not to have our **affiliated companies** market their products or services to you where such marketing is based on information about you that we share with them. Since our affiliated companies, from time to time, do engage in such marketing, we are providing you with the ability to opt-out so that you do not receive these types of marketing communications from us in the future. **To limit these marketing offers, please contact us by telephone at the applicable telephone numbers provided below.**

Your choice to limit marketing offers from our affiliated companies will apply until you tell us to change your choice or for at least five years from when you tell us your choice. Once that period expires, you will receive a renewal notice that will allow you to continue to limit marketing offers from our affiliated companies for at least another five years. For consumers with joint accounts, an opt-out direction by one joint account holder will be treated as applying to all of the associated joint account holders. 

**How do we protect the confidentiality and security of nonpublic personal information?**

* * *

We maintain reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to guard your nonpublic personal information. We protect your account information by placing it on the secure portion of our Web site, using firewalls and other security technology to protect our network and systems from external attacks, and by requiring you to enter a unique user name and password to access your account information online. Also, our servers have been enabled with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to prevent unauthorized parties from viewing the nonpublic personal information that you provide or access during a secure session (look for the padlock icon on your browser). 

In addition, if you access information online, we use digital certificate services to authenticate that you are transacting with our Web site. 

Our employees (e.g., customer service and compliance personnel) and third party service providers have access to your nonpublic personal information only on a "need to know" basis. We conduct regular internal audits of our business practices and procedures, examining confidentiality standards and information access in order to protect your personal information. 

In addition to our security measures, you can also take steps to maximize your security online and to protect your confidential information. Additional information on these topics can be found on the E*TRADE Financial Web site at the **Online Security** link at the bottom of most web pages.
