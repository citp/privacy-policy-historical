We are committed to protecting our customers' personal information. In the course of providing financial products and services, we need to collect and maintain certain personal information. This Privacy Policy answers some questions about what personal information we collect and why, what we do with it, and how we protect it. 

We do not disclose any personal information about our customers to any nonaffiliated third parties, except as described below. 

Please see our Privacy Statement, which we provide to all our customers, for a comprehensive explanation of how we collect, use and share personal information and what you can do to limit the use and sharing of your personal information.

**Why Do We Collect Personal Information?**

* * *

We use and disclose personal information for the purposes that we have disclosed to you, except as otherwise permitted by law. We will request your consent before we use or disclose your information for any materially different purpose. Unless specifically described below, consent may be obtained in any legally-sufficient method. For example, depending on the circumstance and the laws of your jurisdiction, consent may be obtained by providing you with notice and the opportunity to opt-out. 

In general, we collect, use and disclose personal information to meet the needs of our customers and for the following Business Purposes:

We may collect personal information from visitors to our websites and those individuals that participate in a promotion, contest or survey (online or over the telephone). We may use this information to advise them of products, services and other marketing materials which we believe may be of interest to them. We may also invite visitors to participate in market research and surveys and other similar activities. 

**When do we disclose personal information and to what types of entities do we disclose personal information?**

* * *

Generally, where we request personal information from you, we will explain the purpose of its collection and use and to whom it may be disclosed at the time we collect it. If you decide to withhold particular information, it may limit our ability to provide you with the services or products you requested. If you believe that a third party has disclosed your personal information to us without your consent to do so, please contact that third party. If they do not adequately respond to your inquiries, please let us know. 

We may disclose personal information we collect, such as the categories described above, primarily to make available to you the financial products and services that we and our service providers provide. We may also use and disclose personal information as authorized by you. We do not disclose personal information about former customers to anyone, except as permitted by law or to cooperate with regulators or law enforcement authorities. 

We may disclose personal information to the following entities: 

  * among our **affiliated companies** (please see below to see how you may limit the sharing of some of this information for purposes of marketing by our affiliated companies);
  * with nonaffiliated third parties that perform services, such as marketing or market research, on our behalf (e.g., we may provide your name, address, phone number, and/or e-mail address to vendors who send our e-mail or regular mail);
  * with companies that service, maintain, or process for us your transactions and accounts (e.g., we provide information to companies who provide administrative, telecommunications, computer, trade execution, payment or securities clearing, prepare and mail account statements and transaction confirmations and other services in connection with the operation of our business);
  * with nonaffiliated third parties as permitted by or required by law, or to cooperate with regulators or law enforcement authorities (e.g., government/regulatory organizations, such as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the UK Financial Services Authority and Information Commissioner's Office (and other international data protection authorities), as well as any of the securities exchanges, self-regulatory organizations and states we are registered with and to parties under court order or subpoena that request this information);
  * with nonaffiliated third parties for which you have provided your express consent or directed us to make (e.g., any banking or financial institution with which you have or propose to have dealings); and/li>
  * with third parties in connection with the proposed or actual financing, insuring, sale, securitization, assignment or other disposal of all or part of our business or assets (including accounts) for the purposes of evaluating and/or performing the proposed transaction.



We require that all the above entities with which we share your personal information agree to keep your information confidential. We also prohibit them from using or disclosing your information except for the limited purpose and to the persons for whom disclosure was intended, or as otherwise permitted by law. In the event we disclose personal information to our service providers, we require our service providers to agree to contractual requirements that are consistent with our privacy and security policies. We prohibit our service providers from using personal information except for the specific purpose for which we supply it to them, and otherwise comply with the legal requirements applicable to the personal information at issue. 

Information regarding external financial accounts will not be disclosed to non-affiliated entities. Information regarding external financial accounts may be disclosed to our corporate affiliates to provide you with account aggregation services and for marketing purposes unless you opt-out of such sharing. 

**How may you limit (opt-out of) the sharing of your information?**

* * *

The law allows you to opt-out of our **sharing** personal information about you in certain circumstances with **nonaffiliated third party companies;** that is, you may direct us to not make such disclosures. However, we do not currently share information about you with any nonaffiliated third party that triggers this opt-out right. Accordingly, there is no need for you to opt-out or take any other affirmative action telling us not to share such information with nonaffiliated third parties. 

The law also allows you to opt-out of our **sharing** certain personal information about you (e.g., information other than your transactions and experiences with us such as your credit report) among our **affiliated companies;** that is, you may direct us to not make such disclosures. However, we only share your transactions and experiences information (e.g., account balance, trading activity, loan amount, and account history) with our affiliated companies. Therefore, there is no need for you to exercise such opt-out right. 

Finally, the law also gives you the right to limit some kinds of **marketing** from our **affiliated companies**. You may elect not to have our **affiliated companies** market their products or services to you where such marketing is based on information about you that we share with them. Since our affiliated companies, from time to time, do engage in such marketing, we are providing you with the ability to opt-out so that you do not receive these types of marketing communications from us in the future. **To limit these marketing offers, please contact us by using the email or telephone by using the applicable contact information provided below.**

Your choice to limit marketing offers from our affiliated companies will apply until you notify us to change your choice or for at least five years from when you tell us your choice. Once that period expires, you will receive a renewal notice that will allow you to continue to limit marketing offers from our affiliated companies for at least another five years. For consumers with joint accounts, an opt-out direction by one joint account holder will be treated as applying to all of the associated joint account holders. 

**Where do we store personal information?**

* * *

Generally, the personal information that we collect from you will be transferred to and stored in the United States and/or other countries with different levels of privacy protection than may apply in your country of residence. Your personal information also may be processed in the United States, working for us or for one of our related companies, affiliates or suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the provision of support services. By submitting personal information via our website, you agree to any such transfers, storage or other processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to treat your personal information securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

It is important to note that some or all of your personal information provided to third party service providers may be held by them in countries other than your own, including in particular the United States. You acknowledge and understand that your personal information will be subject to the applicable laws of each such jurisdiction, which may not provide for the same protection as your country of residence. For example, government entities in the United States, amongst other countries, may have certain legislative rights to access your personal information. If you would like access to written information about our policies and practices with respect to service providers outside your jurisdiction, you may contact our Chief Privacy Officer, by e-mail at CPO@etrade.com, who will address your questions about the collection, use, disclosure or storage of personal information by our service providers worldwide. 

**How do we protect the confidentiality and security of personal information?**

* * *

We maintain reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to guard your personal information. We protect your account information by placing it on the secure portion of our website, using firewalls and other security technology to protect our network and systems from external attacks, and by requiring you to enter a unique user name and password to access your account information online. Also, our servers have been enabled with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to prevent unauthorized parties from viewing the personal information that you provide or access during a secure session (look for the padlock icon on your browser). 

In addition, if you access information online, we use digital certificate services to authenticate that you are transacting with our website. 

Our employees (e.g., customer service and compliance personnel) and third party service providers have access to your personal information only on a "need to know" basis. We conduct regular internal audits of our business practices and procedures, examining confidentiality standards and information access in order to protect your personal information. 

In addition to our security measures, you can also take steps to maximize your security online and to protect your confidential information. Additional information on these topics can be found on the E*TRADE Financial website at the **Online Security** link at the bottom of most web pages.

We will process that request in line with any local laws and our policies and procedures in place for dealing with such requests. 

There may be circumstances where we are unable to provide access to all of your personal information. We may deny, or restrict access for legally permissible reasons, such as situations where the information contains references to other individuals and is not reasonably severable, or where it cannot be disclosed for legal, security, or commercial proprietary reasons. We will advise you of any reason for denying or restricting an access request to the extent permitted by law, rule or regulation. 

We shall make every reasonable effort to maintain your personal information in an accurate, complete and up-to-date form.

Unless we have your personal information in its capacity as a third-party administrative record keeper, when an individual successfully demonstrates the inaccuracy or incompleteness of personal information held by us, we will correct or update the information as required. 

Please note that before we are able to provide you with any information or correct any inaccuracies we may ask you to verify your identity and to provide other details to help us to respond to your request. We will only use this information in order to verify your identity.

You may notify us of your desire to withdraw consent by contacting our Chief Privacy Officer as noted above. 

**Notice to California residents**
