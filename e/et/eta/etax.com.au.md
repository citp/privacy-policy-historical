Etax understands that you, as an Etax website visitor and as a user of Etax’s services, are concerned about your privacy.

First of all, Etax does not rent or sell your email or any other details to anyone for any reason.

A very basic summary of what we do with your details is, we’ll collect some simple information and use cookies in order to offer you relevant and useful content and notices, and, if you decide to start a tax return and use our services, then we’ll save the information you enter on our website only for the purpose of preparing, checking and lodging your tax return to the ATO and for providing our tax agent service to you and delivering tax-related information and reminders to you.

#### Now let’s cover the details in a way that lawyers like to do…

This Privacy Policy sets out our commitment to protecting the privacy of personal information provided to us, or otherwise collected by us, offline or online, including through our website and mobile application ( **Site** ).

#### Cookies and web beacons

We may use cookies on our Site from time to time. Cookies are text files placed in your computer’s browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your email address or other personally identifiable information. However, they do allow third parties, such as Google and Facebook, to cause our advertisements to appear on your social media and online media feeds as part of retargeting campaigns. If and when you choose to provide our Site with personal information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.

Areas of the Site that do not require a login may allocate a cookie for purpose of:

  * Identifying your Internet browser as one connecting to or receiving Etax services; and
  * Storing information related to personalisation of the Site.



We also use cookies for secure services (that is, an area of the Site where you are required to log on). These cookies are used for a variety of purposes, including for security and personalisation reasons.

You block cookies by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse the setting of all or some cookies. However, if your browser is configured to reject all cookies you will be unable to use secure services on the Site that require cookies in order for you to participate. You may still be able to use some of the information-only pages even if you do not accept cookies.

We may use web beacons on our Site from time to time. Web beacons (also known as Clear GIFs) are small pieces of code placed on a web page to monitor the visitor’s behaviour and collect data about the visitor’s viewing of a web page. For example, web beacons can be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that page.

We may use Google Analytics to collect and process data. To find out how Google uses data when you use third party websites or applications, please see www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/ or any other URL Google may use from time to time.
