# Privacy Policy

Ethan Allen understands and respects your concerns about privacy and we are committed to providing you with a safe online experience. The information below describes the type of information we collect, how it is used, and steps we take to protect your personally identifiable information. This policy applies to website orders and does not necessarily apply to orders placed by phone or in Design Centers. Periodically, we update our Privacy and Security policies. We encourage you to check this section for any changes.

## How do we protect our clients' credit card information?

To prevent unauthorized access to your information, our secure server uses a Secure Sockets Layer protocol to encrypt all your personal information before it is sent to us.

To further safeguard your information, we have a well-established Employee Privacy Policy that prohibits unauthorized access, disclosure, or use of your personal information in any way. 

You are free to access ethanallen.com without submitting any personally identifiable information.

## What personally identifiable information do we collect via ethanallen.com and how is it used?

We collect only the information that we need to administer our business, provide superior service, and communicate information about our products and services that we believe to be of interest to you.

This includes your name, address, telephone and fax numbers, email address, credit card and purchase information. If you tell us which Design Centers you've shopped in and/or which designers you've worked with, we will record that information as well. We use this information to process your purchases and requests and to provide superior service. Information about your shopping cart choices, purchases, or requests for design assistance may be passed along to the closest Ethan Allen Design Center in our retail network, which is made up of independently owned and authorized Design Centers and corporate-owned Design Centers. Credit card and financing information is provided to credit card and consumer financing companies as required to process applications and transactions.

If you agree to associate your social networking account with us (e.g., liking us on Facebook, following us on Twitter), we may receive personal information about you from the site in accordance with each site's terms of use and privacy policy.

Information that you supply is added to our client database. We make portions of our web and phone order client list available to carefully chosen business partners. If you do not want your name made available this way, if you’ve moved, or if you would prefer not to receive our catalogs, please click the "Removal From Mailings" link in the "Need Help?" section at the bottom of any page. If you no longer wish to receive our digital communications, please click the "Unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any of our emails.

Information may also be stored and used to better understand our clients, their needs, ways to improve our products and services, and to contact clients with offers that may be of interest to them.

## What other information do we collect via ethanallen.com and how is it used?

We may collect information that could include data about your operating system, domain name, browser, and the pages on our website that you access or visit. This information is anonymous and may be used to evaluate the ease of use and convenience of our website and to make further improvements. We also allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit ethanallen.com. These companies may collect non-personally identifiable information (e.g., subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over, browser type, etc.) via a cookie or third party web beacon. You may opt out by clicking in the appropriate place on the ad or by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page, which can be found here: networkadvertising.org/choices/.

## What is the privacy policy for children?

We have designed ethanallen.com so that it does not ask for or collect personally identifiable information (name, address, telephone or fax numbers, email addresses) from children (individuals under the age of 13). If we discover that a child under the age of 13 has submitted information to us, we will not use it for any purpose and will delete the information from our database.

## What are “cookies” and how are they used?

A “cookie” is a small amount of data sent to your browser from a website server that may be stored on your computer’s hard drive. When you visit our website, this site may store a cookie or similar file on your computer. This information may be used for general purposes such as providing you with more personalized service, storing your zip code, and even helping us track our website visits and traffic patterns.

Most web browsers allow users to exercise control over cookies by blocking them, erasing them, or notifying users when such a file is stored. We encourage you to refer to your browser’s instructions to learn about those functions and options.

## How may I stop the use of my personally identifiable information?

If you do not want your name made available, if you’ve moved, or if you would prefer not to receive our catalogs, please click the "Removal From Mailings" link in the "Need Help?" section at the bottom of any page. If you no longer wish to receive our digital communications, please click the "Unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any of our emails.

## Under what circumstances is personal information turned over to law enforcement agencies?

Any stored information that becomes subject to a subpoena, court order, or other request by any local, state, or federal agency will be provided to the requesting agency as deemed necessary by Ethan Allen.
