The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. - See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</p><h4>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</h4><p>Users can visit our site anonymously <br>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page, or as a minimum on the first significant page after entering our website.

The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.</p><p>We do not specifically market to children under 13.</p><h4>Fair Information Practices</h4><p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p><h4>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</h4><span>We will notify the users via email</span><ul><li>Within 7 business days</li></ul><p>We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p><h4>CAN SPAM Act</h4><p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p><h4>We collect your email address in order to:</h4><ul><li>Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.</li><li>Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders</li><li>We may also send you additional information related to your product and/or service.</li><li>Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the original transaction has occurred</li></ul><h4>To be in accordance with CANSPAM we agree to the following:</h4><ul><li>NOT use false, or misleading subjects or email addresses</li><li>Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way</li><li>Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters</li><li>Monitor third party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.</li><li>Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly</li><li>Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email</li></ul><h4>If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email us at</h4><ul><li>Follow the instructions at the bottom of each email.</li></ul><p>and we will promptly remove you from <strong>ALL</strong> correspondence.</p><h4>Contacting Us</h4><p>If there are any questions regarding this privacy policy you may contact us using the information below.</p><ul class="list-unstyled list-icons"><li><a href="/">EthosPay.com</a></li><li><i class="fa fa-map-marker" aria-hidden="true"></i>20801 Biscayne Blvd<br> Suite 27<br> Aventura Florida 33180<br></li><li><i class="fa fa-envelope-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>contact@ethospay.com</li><li><i class="fa fa-phone" aria-hidden="true"></i>(800) 280-5287</li></ul></div><section class="trusted-section grey-section"><div class="container text-center"><div class="gs-title"><h3>Trusted by <span class="countTo text-blue" data-speed="4000">2672</span> merchants.</h3><p class="heading-subtitle">We’ve helped match all kinds of businesses with the perfect merchant banking solution.</p></div><div class="trusted-logos"><img class="img-responsive" src="/assets/images/trusted-logos/authorize.svg" alt=""><img class="img-responsive" src="/assets/images/trusted-logos/nmi.svg" alt=""><img class="img-responsive" src="/assets/images/trusted-logos/elavon.svg" alt=""><img class="img-responsive" src="/assets/images/trusted-logos/tsys.svg" alt=""><img class="img-responsive" src="/assets/images/trusted-logos/worldpay.svg" alt=""></div></div></section><section class="pre-footer text-center"><div class="container"><div class="pf-heading"><h3>Help your business expand and flourish today.</h3><p class="text-green">Start accepting credit cards within 72 hours and join our family of over 2672 happy merchants.</p></div><form class="ethos-form ef-inner" action="" method="post"><div class="ef-body input-group"><input type="email" class="ef-email form-control" name="email" placeholder="Email Address"><input type="hidden" class="" name="LastName" value="homepage"><input type="hidden" class="" name="Company" value="homepage"><span class="email-error"></span><span class="input-group-btn"><button type="submit" class="btn btn-green">Apply Now</button></span><div class="succes-send"><div class="succes-cont"><i class="ei ei-mail-alt"></i><p>Thank you for your interest in EthosPay, your inquiry has been sent successfully.
