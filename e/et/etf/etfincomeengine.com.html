We use this information mainly to provide a personalized experience as you use our Products and Services.

    <td class="normal"><p><u>Upon Registration</u>: Members may be asked to provide certain personal information when signing up for our Products and Services including name, address, telephone number, billing information, (such as credit card number) and the type of personal computer being used to access Services. Personal information collected from Members during the registration process is used to manage each Member’s account (e.g., for billing purposes.) This personal information is not shared with third parties, except as provided for herein. We may also generate general non-identifying profile information from the personal information that Members provide during registration (e.g., total number of Members, but not Member names), and such information may be used to sell advertisements. </p></td>
