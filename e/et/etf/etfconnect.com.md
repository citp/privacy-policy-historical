## Privacy Policy

Nuveen Investments (and its affiliated investment advisers and funds) considers your privacy our utmost concern. In order to provide you with individualized service, we collect certain nonpublic personal information about you from information you provide on applications or other forms (such as your address and social security number), and information about your account transactions with us (such as purchases, sales and account balances). We may also collect such information through your account inquiries by mail, email, telephone, or web site.

We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about you to anyone, except as permitted by law. Specifically, so that we may continue to offer you Nuveen Investments products and services that best meet your investing needs, and to effect transactions that you request or authorize, we may disclose the information we collect, as described above, to companies that perform administrative or marketing services on our behalf, such as transfer agents, or printers and mailers that assist us in the distribution of investor materials. These companies will use this information only for the services for which we hired them, and are not permitted to use or share this information for any other purpose.

If you decide at some point either to close your account(s) or to become an inactive customer, we will continue to adhere to the privacy policies and practices described in this notice. With regard to our internal security procedures, we restrict access to your personal and account information to those employees who need to know that information to service your account. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your nonpublic personal information.

### Anti-Money Laundering

The USA PATRIOT Act, signed by President Bush, is designed to detect, deter, and punish terrorists in the United States and abroad. The Act imposes new anti-money laundering requirements on all financial institutions – from check-cashing and currency exchange stores to the largest banks, brokerage firms and mutual fund companies – including Nuveen Investments (and its affiliated investment advisers and funds).

To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person or company that opens an account. When you open an account, you will be required to provide your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you and any other persons listed on your account that have trading authority.

For questions about our policy, or for additional copies of this notice, please contact Nuveen Investments at 333 W. Wacker Drive, Chicago, IL 60606, or (800) 257-8787.
