	<h2>Zugo Limited Privacy Policy</h2>


  <p class="c11"><span class="c1">Welcome to</span> <span class="c1 c2">www.zugo.com</span> <span class="c1">(the “</span><span class="c1 c2">Site</span><span class="c1">”), a website operated by Zugo Limited
  (“</span><span class="c1 c2">Zugo</span><span class="c1">”,
  “</span><span class="c1 c2">we</span><span class="c1">”,
  “</span><span class="c1 c2">us</span><span class="c1">”, or
  “</span><span class="c1 c2">our</span><span class="c1">”). &nbsp;We also
  partner with website operators to offer toolbars and other tools
  (“</span><span class="c1 c2">Toolbars</span><span class="c1">”) powered by
  Bing, Yahoo! and other leading search providers for download to our users. We will
  refer to the Toolbars and the other related services we provide as the
  “</span><span class="c1 c2">Services</span><span class="c1">”. We are aware
  of the trust you place in us and our responsibility to protect your privacy. As part of
  this responsibility, we provide this privacy policy (“</span><span class="c1 c2">Privacy Policy</span><span class="c1">”) to let you know what information
  we collect, how we use it, share it and protect it.</span></p>

  <p class="c11"><span class="c1">YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED BY US IN THE
  COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES)
  WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE
  LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY. &nbsp;BY USING THIS SITE AND PROVIDING ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION,
  YOU ARE CONSENTING TO THE TRANSFER OF DATA FROM YOUR COUNTRY TO A COUNTRY THAT HAS LESS
  STRINGENT LAWS, AND THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IN CONFORMANCE WITH
  THIS POLICY.</span></p>

  <p class="c11"><span class="c1">So we are clear about the terminology we are using,
  when we use the phrase</span> <span class="c1 c2">“Personal
  Information”</span> <span class="c1">in this Privacy Policy, we mean information
  that is used or intended to be used to personally identify an individual, like your
  name, address, e-mail address, or phone number, as well as other non-public information
  that is associated with this personal information. When we use the phrase
  "</span><span class="c1 c2">Anonymous Information</span><span class="c1">" in this
  Privacy Policy, we mean information that that is not used nor intended to be used to
  personally &nbsp;identify an individual, and is not associated with or linked to
  Personal Information.</span></p>

  <p class="c7"><span class="c1">As a general rule there are four categories of users of
  the Site and Services: “</span><span class="c1 c2">Partners</span><span class="c1">" who offer Toolbars to End Users, “</span><span class="c1 c2">Search
  Providers</span><span class="c1">” who operate search engines that are accessed
  through the Toolbar, "</span><span class="c1 c2">End Users</span><span class="c1">" who
  are individual users of a Toolbar or the Site and “</span><span class="c1 c2">Visitors</span><span class="c1">” who are individual visitors who browse
  the Site. &nbsp; Our privacy policy terms with respect to Partners and Search Providers
  are as set forth in our agreements with such parties, and this Privacy Policy does not
  describe how we collect, use, share or protect information from Partners and Search
  Providers.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"></p>

  <p class="c7"><span class="c1 c2">Children.</span></p>

  <p class="c7"><span class="c1">We do not knowingly collect or maintain information from
  individuals who are under 13 years of age, and no part of our Site or Services are
  designed to attract people under the age of 13. Protecting the privacy of children is
  very important to us. If we obtain knowledge that a user is under the age of 13, we
  will take steps to remove that user's information from our databases.</span></p>

    use your Personal Information to administer your account and provide you customer
    support and services, to send communications and administrative emails, to respond to

  <ol class="c8">
    <li class="c6 c4" value="1"><span class="c1">When they help us operate our business,

  <p class="c0"></p>

  <p class="c4 c9"><span class="c1 c15 c2">Information Collected Through the
  Toolbar</span></p>

  <p class="c0"></p>

  <p class="c7"><span class="c1">We work with Partners to provide search functionality
  through the Toolbars via a Search Provider. When an End User uses the Toolbars to
  search on the web, certain information is collected from such End User, and this
  section describes how we collect, use and share such information collected through the
  Toolbars.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"></p>

  <p class="c7"><span class="c1 c15 c2">PLEASE NOTE THAT OUR PARTNERS AND SEARCH
  PROVIDERS MAY INDEPENDENTLY COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT YOU, AND THIS PRIVACY POLICY DOES
  NOT GOVERN THEIR COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF SUCH INFORMATION. THIS PRIVACY
  POLICY ONLY COVERS THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU. PLEASE CONSULT THEIR PRIVACY
  POLICIES BEFORE USING THE TOOLBAR.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"></p>

  <p class="c7"><span class="c1 c15">The Information We Gather From End Users and How We
  Use It:</span></p>

  <p class="c0"></p>

  <ol class="c8">
    <li class="c6 c4" value="1"><span class="c1">Personal Information&nbsp;– You do
    not need to provide any Personal Information in order to download and use the
    Toolbar. However, it is possible for data that usually contains no Personal
    Information, such as search queries or page addresses, to contain such information in
    certain cases.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <p class="c0 c4"></p>

  <ol class="c8">
    <li class="c6 c4" value="2"><span class="c1">Anonymous Information&nbsp;– Any
    time you use a Toolbar to contact a Search Provider, such as by sending a search
    query, the Toolbar sends standard, limited information including your Internet
    Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request,
    unique machine ID, and unique user ID. &nbsp;When you type URLs or queries in the
    Toolbar search box, the letters you type may be sent to us so that we can
    automatically recommend search terms or URLs you may be looking for. We collect and
    use this information to: (i) improve our internal operations or software, (ii)
    customize the content and/or layout of the web page for each individual visitor;
    (iii) notify visitors about updates to our web site or software; and (iv) contact
    consumers for marketing purposes. We also may log your recent search history and
    browser URL history when installing the Toolbar for random sampling to protect
    against fraud. Our Toolbars place Cookies on your computer, and we use Cookies as
    part of your search process to control the search preferences of the Toolbars and
    start pages. We also use Cookies, web bugs and pixel tags to monitor volume of
    traffic, record information about how you use the Web, for example, the websites you
    have visited and web searches that you conducted and other click-stream data, none of
    which includes Personal Information about you, personalize and tailor your experience
    with the Toolbar, and deliver targeted advertising, as described in more detail
    below. Cookies may also be used in the future to display recent search history and/or
    search suggestions. If you choose to disable Cookies, you may not be able to use
    certain features of the Toolbars. Third parties, including our Partners and Search
    Providers, may collect information through the Toolbars, and such third
    parties’ use of the information collected will be governed by their own privacy
    policies as further described below.</span> <span class="c1">We make the Toolbars
    available to End Users at no cost. To support our Services, we use the Anonymous
    Information we collect to deliver or enable the delivery of advertising that is
    customized to you, an End User, based on your preferences and internet usage. For
    example, we may use your IP address to determine your geographic location and deliver
    advertising to you on behalf of businesses that are in your neighborhood or that sell
    products and services in your area. We may notice that you have been looking at car
    websites and deliver advertisements from car manufacturers. We view these targeted
    advertisements, which you may see on almost any website on the Internet, as a benefit
    to both you and the advertiser as we bring closer together consumers who are looking
    for products with manufacturers who provide them. We understand, however, that some
    people prefer not to receive targeted advertising. At this time, we do not have a way
    for End Users to opt out of this feature of the Toolbar, so if you are one of those
    people, you may choose not to install and use our Toolbars.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <p class="c0 c4"></p>

  <p class="c7"><span class="c1 c15">Information Sharing.</span></p>

  <p class="c7"><span class="c1">We may disclose Anonymous Information on our discretion.
  When you input a search query into one of our Toolbars, we pass the search query to the
  Search Provider we have contracted with to provide search results. The Search
  Provider’s use of the search query, any results and other information collected,
  used or disclosed associated with the search is governed by their privacy policy.
  &nbsp;In addition, we share search query volume data and install volume data with our
  Partners, along with aggregated revenue information. More specific search and install
  related data may also be shared with our Search Providers (e.g. average number of
  searches and users, number of active Toolbars or number of Toolbar updates) and to
  third party vendors who may help us enhance or provide the Toolbars. In addition, we
  may assist our Partners in setting Cookies so that we can share all or some of the
  Anonymous Information with them. Our Partners use the Anonymous Information to deliver
  targeted advertising.</span> <span class="c1">To be clear, the Anonymous Information
  provided to other parties does not contain any Personal Information of End Users.
  Please note that our Search Providers and Partners have their own privacy policies that
  govern their use of information. Our current Partners and Search Providers include, but
  are not limited to the following, and their privacy policies may be found at the URLs
  listed below:</span></p>
