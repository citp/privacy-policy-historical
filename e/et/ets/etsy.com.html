 <p><strong><font color="d15600" size="5">Etsy Privacy Policy</font></strong></p>
<p><strong>What This Privacy Policy Covers<a href="http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.etsy.com&amp;sealid=101"><img src="images/clickseal.gif" width="91" height="73" border="0" align="right"></a></strong></p>

<p><strong>Information Collection and How it is Used</strong></p>
<p>General Information: <br>
  • We hate spam as much as you do. We never sell or disclose your name 
  or e-mail address to third parties.<br>
  • Etsy collects personal information when you register with Etsy to use 
  Etsy services or to post content on Etsy. When you register we ask for your 
  email address and certain optional information such as biographical information, 
  favorite materials and personal interests. <br>
  • If you would like to obtain a Seller account, we will ask for your billing 
  address, phone number, and credit card information. <br>
  • Etsy automatically receives and records information on our server logs 
  from your browser, including your IP address, cookie, and the page you request. 
  <br>
  • Etsy uses information for the following general purposes: products and 
  services provision, billing, identification and authentication, services improvement, 
  contact, research, and anonymous reporting. IP Addresses IP Addresses are automatically 
  reported by your browser each time you view a web page. Your IP address is stored 
  in our user registration databases when you register with Etsy. IP addresses 
  may be used for various purposes, including: to diagnose or service technology 
  problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated with the IP 
  addresses controlled by a specific web company or ISP; to estimate the total 
  number of users visiting Etsy from specific geographical regions; to make sure 
  that people are not voting for themselves or friends during contests or promotions.</p>
<p><strong>Service-related Announcements </strong></p>
<p>We will send you a welcome/confirmation email when you sign up for our services. 
  Receipt of this email is required for using our services.</p>
<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when 
  it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended 
  for maintenance, we might send you an email. </p>
<p>Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional 
  in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate 
  your account by emailing <a href="mailto:support@etsy.com ">support@etsy.com </a> 
  from the email address you signed up with.</p>
<p><strong>Choice/Opt-out</strong></p>
<p>If you no longer wish to receive service communications, you may opt-out of 
  receiving them by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@etsy.com ">support@etsy.com </a>.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique 
  identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored 
  on your computer's hard drive. You can configure your browser to accept all 
  cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. If you reject 
  all cookies, you will not be able to use Etsy products or services that require 
  you to "sign in," and you may not be able to take full advantage of 
  the Etsy service. Etsy uses its own cookies for a number of purposes, including 
  to: Access your information when you "sign in"; keep track of preferences 
  you specify while you are using Etsy's services; display the most appropriate 
  advertising banners, based on your interests and activity on Etsy; estimate 
  and report our total audience size and traffic; conduct research to improve 
  Etsy's content and services. We do not link the information we store in cookies 
  to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.</p>
<p><strong>Information Sharing and Disclosure</strong></p>
<p>When you post a message, your Etsy ID or alias that you are posting under is 
  visible to other users. If you post personal information online that is accessible 
  to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. 
  Etsy may be required to disclose personally identifiable information under special 
  circumstances, such as to comply with subpoenas or when your actions violate 
  the Etsy Terms of Service. Etsy may share demographic information with business 
  partners, such as "53% of users who regularly user Etsy chat are between 
  18 and 24" or the like. No personally identifiable information will ever 
  be used without your permission.</p>
<p>Etsy does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other 
  people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've 
  requested or when we have your permission. It may be necessary to share information 
  in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, 
  suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety 
  of any person, violations of Etsy's terms of use, or as otherwise required by 
  law. We will transfer information about you if Etsy is acquired by or merged 
  with another company. In this event, Etsy will notify you by email or by putting 
  a prominent notice on the Etsy web site before information about you is transferred 
  and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. </p>
<p>As part of the buying and selling process on Etsy, you will will obtain the 
  email address and/or shipping address of other Etsy members. By entering into 
  our User Agreement, you agree that, with respect to other users' personal information 
  that you obtain through Etsy or through an Etsy-related communication or Etsy-facilitated 
  transaction, Etsy hereby grants to you a license to use such information only 
  for Etsy-related communications that are not unsolicited commercial messages. 
  Etsy and our users do not tolerate spam. Therefore, without limiting the foregoing, 
  you are not licensed to add an Etsy user, even a user who has purchased an item 
  from you, to your mail list (email or physical mail) without their express consent. 
</p>
<p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as 
  required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect 
  our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process 
  served on our Web site.</p>
<p><strong>Bulletin Boards / Chat Rooms</strong></p>
<p>If you use a bulletin board or chat room on this site, you should be aware 
  that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, 
  or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited 
  messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information 
  you choose to submit in these forums.</p>
<p><strong>Editing and Deleting Account Information</strong></p>
<p>You can change your Etsy Account Information (except your username), at any 
  time. We may send you certain communications relating to the Etsy service, such 
  as service announcements and administrative messages, that are considered part 
  of your Etsy account. You can delete your Etsy account at any time from your 
  account page; however, please note that your identification, billing and contact 
  information may remain in Etsy's records for some period. </p>
<p>We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe 
  reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products 
  or services to you or in order to do their jobs. Your Etsy Account Information 
  is password-protected. In certain areas, Etsy uses SSL-encryption to protect 
  data transmissions. </p>
<p>If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire 
  our service, you may correct, update, delete or deactivate it by making the 
  change on your member account page or by emailing our Customer Support at <a href="mailto:support@etsy.com ">support@etsy.com </a> 
  or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed 
  below.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter 
  sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) 
  on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure 
  socket layer technology (SSL). To learn more about our SSL, follow this link. 
  We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information 
  submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method 
  of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% 
  secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means 
  to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.If 
  you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send email us 
  at <a href="mailto:support@etsy.com ">support@etsy.com </a>.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this 
  privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that 
  you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what 
  circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this privacy 
  statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes 
  to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on 
  our homepage.</p>
