**Information Sharing and Disclosure**

When you post a message, your Etsy ID or alias that you are posting under is visible to other users. If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Etsy may be required to disclose personally identifiable information under special circumstances, such as to comply with subpoenas or when your actions violate the Etsy Terms of Service. Etsy may share demographic information with business partners, such as "53% of users who regularly user Etsy chat are between 18 and 24" or the like. No personally identifiable information will ever be used without your permission.

Etsy does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested or when we have your permission. It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Etsy's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. We will transfer information about you if Etsy is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Etsy will notify you by email or by putting a prominent notice on the Etsy web site before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

Etsy and our users do not tolerate spam. Therefore, without limiting the foregoing, you are not licensed to add an Etsy user, even a user who has purchased an item from you, to your mail list (email or physical mail) without their express consent. 

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.
