                          the "Service") to give us &nbsp;contact information, such as their
                          name, address, phone number, and e-mail &nbsp;address, and billing
                          information, such as billing name and address, credit card
                          &nbsp;number, and the school grade and subjects to use the service. </p>
                        <p>You understand and agree
                          that we may use your IP address to help diagnose &nbsp;problems with
                          our server and to administer the Service. Your IP address is
                          &nbsp;required to help identify you and to develop important
                          demographic information &nbsp;about the users of the Service. </p>
                        <p>The Service may use
                          cookies (i.e., session information written to your computer by your

                          last working in any part of our sites. eTutorWorld uses 128 Byte SSL
                          encryption for the Service. More information on our use of "cookies"
                          can be found below (eTutorWorld Cookies). We do not, however, have
                          access to any information about you from cookies you might receive
                          while using the Service. </p>
                        <p>Except as we explicitly
                          state at the time we request information, we do not &nbsp;disclose to
                          third parties the information provided. All financial and billing
                          &nbsp;information that we collect through the Site is used solely to
                          check the &nbsp;qualifications of prospective customers and to bill for
                          the Service. This billing &nbsp;information is not used by eTutorWorld
                          for marketing or promotional purposes. &nbsp;eTutorWorld uses a credit
                          card authorization service provider to manage the &nbsp;credit card
                          processing. This service provider uses the information for the sole
                          &nbsp;purpose of credit card processing. </p>
                        <p><strong>3.&nbsp;Information you       provide : </strong>For
                          children under age 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act
                          &nbsp;(COPPA) provides that a parent's permission must be obtained
                          before your &nbsp;personal information may be collected and used.
                          Please have your parents &nbsp;contact &nbsp;us before we are able to
                          create an account for you or provide you with any tutoring. </p>
                        <p><strong>4.&nbsp;Note to       parents of children under the age of 13 :</strong> You are welcome to contact &nbsp;us to review any identifiable
                          information we have collected about your child. If &nbsp;you desire,
                          you may request that we delete this information and/or specify that
                          &nbsp;we collect no more of your child's information. Please note that
                          we will need to &nbsp;verify the identity of anyone requesting
                          information about a child to ensure that &nbsp;the person is in fact
                          the child's parent or legal guardian, and that a request for &nbsp;us
                          to delete all personal information about a child requires us to cancel
                          the &nbsp;child's &nbsp;tutoring account. </p>
                        <p><strong>5.&nbsp;Note to       Students : </strong>If
                          your parents and/or your school pay for/subsidize the cost of your
                          tutoring, &nbsp;we may share your personal information with them at
                          their request. This &nbsp;includes the content of your tutoring
                          sessions (transcripts) and the written &nbsp;comments you leave in
                          post-session surveys. </p>
                        <p>On the other hand, if
                          you pay us from your own account, without the &nbsp;involvement of your
                          parents or your school, we will not share your personal
                          &nbsp;information with them. If we have reason to believe that
                          disclosing your &nbsp;personal identification is required by law, or is
                          otherwise reasonable to protect &nbsp;someone from possible injury, we
                          may do so. </p>
                        <p>At eTutorWorld, though
                          we make every effort to preserve your privacy we may &nbsp;need to
                          disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a
                          &nbsp;good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a
                          current judicial &nbsp;proceeding, a court order or legal process
                          served on our Web site. </p>
