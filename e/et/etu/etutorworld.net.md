# Privacy Policy | Personal Online Tutoring | Online Tutoring Service | eTutorWorld

**eTutorWorld has a firm commitment to protecting your privacy. We value your privacy and we will never sell your email address and personal information. The following statement explains our policy in regard to the use of any personal information you may give us as you use any part of eTutorWorld website.**

**1.**  This Policy applies to all of the products, services and websites offered by  eTutorWorld or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies (collectively,  eTutorWorld’s "services"). In order to participate in the Service, you understand  and agree that you may be asked to provide Personal Identifying Information as  part of the registration process and at other points in using the Service, and that  we will store information that you provide. In the course of our business we will  use that information in aggregated form to provide statistical user data about our  subscribers to advertisers, potential advertisers, and content licensors. At various  points in using the Service you may also need to provide additional Personal  Identifying Information so that we can perform tasks you request in the Service,  such as fulfilling orders or make calculations to estimate financial aid eligibility.  During the registration process, you are given the opportunity to indicate whether  you want us or our partners to contact you about the Service, our sites, our other  products and services, or products and services from other companies, or whether  you do not want to receive any such notices. Any specific Personal Identifying  Information gathered by us shall not be disclosed to third parties without your  permission. 

**2.**   **Information we collect and how we use it :** In order to provide our full range of services, we require customers, who register  to use the services offered on our Site (collectively, the "Service") to give us  contact information, such as their name, address, phone number, and e-mail  address, and billing information, such as billing name and address, credit card  number, and the school grade and subjects to use the service. 

You understand and agree that we may use your IP address to help diagnose  problems with our server and to administer the Service. Your IP address is  required to help identify you and to develop important demographic information  about the users of the Service. 

The Service may use cookies (i.e., session information written to your computer by your browser) to help you keep track of where you left off when you were last working in any part of our sites. eTutorWorld uses 128 Byte SSL encryption for the Service. More information on our use of "cookies" can be found below (eTutorWorld Cookies). We do not, however, have access to any information about you from cookies you might receive while using the Service. 

Except as we explicitly state at the time we request information, we do not  disclose to third parties the information provided. All financial and billing  information that we collect through the Site is used solely to check the  qualifications of prospective customers and to bill for the Service. This billing  information is not used by eTutorWorld for marketing or promotional purposes.  eTutorWorld uses a credit card authorization service provider to manage the  credit card processing. This service provider uses the information for the sole  purpose of credit card processing. 

**3.  Information you provide : **For children under age 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act  (COPPA) provides that a parent's permission must be obtained before your  personal information may be collected and used. Please have your parents  contact  us before we are able to create an account for you or provide you with any tutoring. 

**4.  Note to parents of children under the age of 13 :** You are welcome to contact  us to review any identifiable information we have collected about your child. If  you desire, you may request that we delete this information and/or specify that  we collect no more of your child's information. Please note that we will need to  verify the identity of anyone requesting information about a child to ensure that  the person is in fact the child's parent or legal guardian, and that a request for  us to delete all personal information about a child requires us to cancel the  child's  tutoring account. 

**5.  Note to Students : **If your parents and/or your school pay for/subsidize the cost of your tutoring,  we may share your personal information with them at their request. This  includes the content of your tutoring sessions (transcripts) and the written  comments you leave in post-session surveys. 

On the other hand, if you pay us from your own account, without the  involvement of your parents or your school, we will not share your personal  information with them. If we have reason to believe that disclosing your  personal identification is required by law, or is otherwise reasonable to protect  someone from possible injury, we may do so. 

At eTutorWorld, though we make every effort to preserve your privacy we may  need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a  good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial  proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.
