# Privacy Policy for e-Healthcare Solutions

### Overview

e-Healthcare Solutions, LLC (EHS) is committed to protecting the privacy of our users (referred to as either "you" or "Users"). EHS uses its best efforts to ensure that the information you submit directly to EHS via EHS member web sites ("affiliated Web Sites") remains private, and is used only for the purposes as set forth herein. 

### Applicability of Policy

This Privacy Statement applies only to information collected from you or submitted by you on participating EHS affiliated Web Sites, where the information is submitted directly to EHS through a shared portion of page real-estate on an EHS affiliated website. The policy is not applicable to each individual website. Each participating EHS website may have it's own privacy policy, which we encourage you to read and understand. EHS has no authority over each websites individual privacy policy. 

### General Information Collected

First and foremost, EHS does not automatically obtain any personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, address, phone number, or e-mail address, when you visit our affiliated websites unless you voluntarily provide such information. EHS may, however, automatically collect non-personally identifiable information about you, such as the server your computer is logged onto, your browser type (for example, Netscape or Internet Explorer), the web pages you visited and whether you responded to any polls or ad delivered by EHS on one of the EHS affiliated websites. This non-personally identifiable information collected by EHS is used for the purpose of improving the EHS websites to make them more useful to you and for better matching content and some advertised products to your needs. 

### User Specific Information Collection

EHS occasionally asks for personal information that will help us better serve your information needs. Whenever EHS asks for such personally identifiable information (e.g., name, address, e-mail address, etc.), we will clearly disclose what information is required, what information is optional, and how that information may be used. 

### Limitations on Disclosures

Under no circumstances will EHS ever disclose (to a third party) personal information about individual medical conditions, except when required by law or court order. Personally identifiable information in the EHS database will not be sold or disclosed to any merchant, advertiser or web publisher. However, EHS does disclose aggregate information, which does not identify individuals or any personally identifiable information, to business partners, advertisers and other third parties. EHS also reserves the right to use such non-personally identifiable information gathered on EHS websites for promoting EHS products and services or the products and services of EHS advertisers and sponsors. However, users of EHS Web sites may opt-out of receiving mailings from such advertisers or sponsors. EHS may also record and share aggregate information provided by you to other Internet websites, which are affiliates or partners with the EHS. It is your obligation to review their Privacy Statement as well as that of any other partner prior to submitting information to a partner or affiliate website. 

### Cookies

EHS, along with thousands of other websites, uses cookies to enhance your web viewing experience. Cookies are small files that your web browser places on your computer's hard drive to collect information about you. EHS cookies do not damage your system or files in any way. Cookies work as follows: When you log on to an EHS website, EHS assigns you a unique number and records that number in the cookie file of your computer. Then, when you visit one of EHS' websites, EHS reads this number to help gain information of the user's of its websites. The cookie can help ensure that the advertisements you see are directed toward you and your needs. However, the EHS cookie will not be associated with any personal information about you, and EHS will not be able to identify you personally online. 

While we believe that cookies enhance your web experience with EHS, you have the option of setting your web browser to reject cookies. However, doing so may negatively impact the performance of the website. 

### Behavioral Targeting

We may use an ad network provider to help present advertisements on this web site. This ad network provider, like other advertising service vendors, uses cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies on the hard drive of your computer to serve you advertisements tailored to interests you have shown by browsing on this and other sites you have visited. It is to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before and to avoid sending you duplicate advertisements. In doing so, the provider collects non-personal data such as your browser type, your operating system, web pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed, and other clickstream data. The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by these ad network providers is subject to their own privacy policies, not ours. If you do not want the benefits of these advertising cookies, you may opt-out by visiting <http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp>. However, if you do so, you may not receive the full benefit from the use of our site. 

### Child Privacy

EHS does not specifically or intentionally collect information about children. If you are concerned about your child's use of the websites, you may use web filtering technology to supervise and limit access to the websites. 

### Opt-Out

EHS permits you to opt-out of receiving certain communications from EHS. To opt-out of receiving targeted communications from EHS based on our targeting system, click here. Again, each website affiliated with EHS has it's own policies and procedures for tracking and targeting messages. By opting out of the EHS targeting, you may still receive targeted ads on EHS affiliated websites if those ads are targeted based on a system other than EHS. 

### Changes to Privacy Statement

This Privacy Statement may be updated from time to time. Changes to this Privacy Statement will be posted by EHS on the Web Sites. It is your obligation to review this Privacy Statement from time to time, and your continued use of the EHS affiliated Web Sites after changes have been posted will be deemed to be your acceptance of the revised Statement. If at any time you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Statement, you may contact EHS via e-mail at [info@e-healthcaresolutions.com](mailto:info@e-healthcaresolutions.com)

### Security

EHS will maintain the confidentiality of the information that it collects during your visit to EHS Web sites. EHS maintains internal practices that help to protect the security and confidentiality of this information by limiting employee access to and use of this information. 

### General

This Privacy Statement is governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of New Jersey, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. Jurisdiction for any claims arising under the terms and conditions of this Privacy Statement shall lie exclusively with the state and federal courts of the State of New Jersey. If any provision of this Privacy Statement is found to be invalid by a court having competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Privacy Statement, which shall remain in full force and effect. 

Privacy Statement last updated, September 2008.
