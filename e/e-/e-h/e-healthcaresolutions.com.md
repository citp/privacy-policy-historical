### Overview

e-Healthcare Solutions, Inc. (e-HS) is committed to protecting the privacy of our users (referred to as either "you" or "Users"). e-HS uses its best efforts to ensure that the information you submit directly to e-HS via e-HS member web sites ("affiliated Web Sites") remains private, and is used only for the purposes as set forth herein. 

  


### Applicability of Policy

This Privacy Statement applies only to information collected from you or submitted by you on participating e-HS affiliated Web Sites, where the information is submitted directly to e-HS through a shared portion of page real-estate on a e-HS affiliated web-site. The policy is not applicable to each individual web-site. Each participating e-HS web-site may have it�s own privacy policy, which we encourage you to read and understand. e-HS has no authority over each web-sites individual privacy policy. 

  


### General Information Collected

First and foremost, e-HS does not automatically obtain any personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, address, phone number, or e-mail address, when you visit our affiliated Web sites unless you voluntarily provide such information. e-HS may, however, automatically collect non-personally identifiable information about you, such as the server your computer is logged onto, your browser type (for example, Netscape or Internet Explorer), the Web pages you visited and whether you responded to any polls or ad delivered by e-HS on one of the e-HS affiliated Web sites. This non-personally identifiable information collected by e-HS is used for the purpose of improving the e-HS web sites to make them more useful to you and for better matching content and some advertised products to your needs. 

  


### User Specific Information Collection

e-HS occasionally asks for personal information that will help us better serve your information needs. Whenever e-HS asks for such personally identifiable information (e.g., name, address, e-mail address, etc.), we will clearly disclose what information is required, what information is optional, and how that information may be used. 

  


### Limitations on Disclosures

Under no circumstances will e-HS ever disclose (to a third party) personal information about individual medical conditions, except when required by law or court order. Personally identifiable information in the e-HS database will not be sold or disclosed to any merchant, advertiser or Web publisher. However, e-HS does disclose aggregate information, which does not identify individuals or any personally identifiable information, to business partners, advertisers and other third parties. e-HS also reserves the right to use such non-personally identifiable information gathered on e-HS web sites for promoting e-HS products and services or the products and services of e-HS advertisers and sponsors. However, users of e-HS Web sites may opt-out of receiving mailings from such advertisers or sponsors. e-HS may also record and share aggregate information provided by you to other Internet web sites, which are affiliates or partners with the e-HS. It is your obligation to review their Privacy Statement as well as that of any other partner prior to submitting information to a partner or affiliate web site.

e-HS, along with thousands of other Web sites, uses cookies to enhance your Web viewing experience. Cookies are small files that your Web browser places on your computer's hard drive to collect information about you. e-HS cookies do not damage your system or files in any way. Cookies work as follows. When you log on to a e-HS Web site, e-HS assigns you a unique number and records that number in the cookie file of your computer. Then, when you visit one of e-HS Web sites, e-HS reads this number to help gain information of the user's of its Web sites. The cookie can help ensure that the advertisements you see are directed toward you and your needs.

### Behavioral Targeting

We may use an ad network provider to help present advertisements on this web site. This ad network provider, like other advertising service vendors, uses cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies on the hard drive of your computer to serve you advertisements tailored to interests you have shown by browsing on this and other sites you have visited, and to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before and to avoid sending you duplicate advertisements. In doing so, the provider collects non-personal data such as your browser type, your operating system, Web pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed, and other clickstream data. The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by these ad network providers is subject to their own privacy policies, not ours. If you do not want the benefits of these advertising cookies, you may opt-out by visiting http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp. However, if you do so you may not receive the full benefit from the use of our site.

### Opt-Out
