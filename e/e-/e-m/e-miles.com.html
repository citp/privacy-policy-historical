         	of <span class="nobr">e-mails</span> desired to be received in a week and such other information that we may

         	education) and profile data (for example, occupation, travel frequency and areas of 
         	interest), but it is encouraged so we can 
         	provide a more personalized experience. Specifically, we use this data to customize 
         	and tailor your experience with the <span class="nobr">e-Miles</span> Service and website, showing you content 
         	in which you may be interested and displaying content according to your preferences. 
         	<br><br> 
 <span class="nobr">e-Miles</span> Service users will receive emails in our opt-in <span class="nobr">e-mail and web </span>

	            Summary information is data that describes the interest profile and demographics data

The use of cookies by our partners and service providers is not covered by our privacy policy.  We do not have access or control over these cookies.

 Web Beacons/Web Bugs
			    <br><br> 
 We employ and our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called 
 Web Beacons (a.k.a. clear gifs, pixel tags, Web bugs) that help us better manage content 
 on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, 
 similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, 
 which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, Web beacons are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are 
 about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We normally do not tie the information gathered 
 by Web beacons to our customers' personally identifiable information. Sometimes, when a member takes an
 action on our site or an advertising partner's site, a web beacon will inform e-Miles of such action so appropriate
 miles can be awarded.
			    <br><br> 
 We use Web beacons in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. 
 This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing 
 campaigns.  If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see "Choice/Opt Out".
			    <br><br> 
We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites.  Our ad network partner uses cookies and 
Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.  
If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking here: <a style="cursor:pointer" href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/?pid=emiles01" target="_blank">Ad Choices</a><img src="http://www.e-miles.com/img/ad_option_icon.png" width="12" height="12" alt="ad choices" style="vertical-align:text-top;">.
