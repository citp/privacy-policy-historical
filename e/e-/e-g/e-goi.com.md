# E-goi :: Privacy and Anti-Spam Policy

E-goi abides by a zero-tolerance spam policy and takes strict measures to enforce it, including, but no limited to, automatically screening and reviewing all contact databases imported by clients to E-goi as well as all messages sent by clients to these databases using E-goi.  
 

At the sole discretion of E-goi, any client account suspected to be transmitting or otherwise connected with spam will be immediately suspended, with no entitlement to any refund, and appropriate civil, criminal or administrative action will be taken against the client and those assisting the client. Please [report to us](https://web.archive.org/index.php?cID=1029 "Contact us") any suspected abuse or violation of this policy.

### Fighting spam

#### On sign-up

By accepting this Anti-Spam Policy, E-goi clients agree that their contact acquisition method requires the contact to provide their prior express consent (opt-in) and that it clearly states the reason for collecting the contact's information, as well as the type of communications the contact will receive after signing up.

#### On removal

E-goi clients agree that every message sent by E-goi contains both an unsubscribe link (allowing contacts to immediately and automatically opt-out from the client's contact database) and the client’s own contact information, such as a contact number or postal address (allowing contacts to request to be manually removed). If you have received messages sent via E-goi which you somehow could not opt out from or if you wish to remove your contact information from all databases used by E-goi clients, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/index.php?cID=1029 "Contact us").
