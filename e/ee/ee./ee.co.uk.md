We use cookies to collect information from visitors and registered customers to our websites to help us improve the websites and services that we make available. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser settings to refuse cookies if you prefer. If you want to disable cookies, find out which browser you are using and follow the instructions below in our 'how to refuse or opt out of cookies' section Unfortunately, if you choose to decline cookies, some of the interactive features and some functionality of our websites may not be available to you. We advise regular users of our websites to accept cookies from us.

Different cookies are used to perform different functions. We detail below our use of cookies. Please note that our advertisers or third party websites to which we link may also use cookies over which we have no control.

**Our use of cookies

Essential Cookies

**

Some cookies are essential for us to use in order to provide you with the services you have requested. These cookies will be used to manage the delivery of any web services requested by you and if you do not accept these cookies you will not be able to receive the services that you have requested e.g. pay for goods and services or access secure areas of our websites. These cookies do not gather information about you that could be used for marketing purposes or remembering where you have been on the internet.

**Remembering your selections cookies**

We also use cookies to remember your selections that change the way our websites behave or look e.g. the font sizes or layout you have chosen etc. These types of cookies can also be used to deliver a specific function requested by you which is not core to the usage of the website e.g. streaming a video. Please note that if you delete these cookies, we will no longer be able to remember your preferences or remember your log in details or provide you with the content you have requested. When selecting your choices for the first time we may ask you whether you want us to remember your choices and if you do this it will constitute consent of our use of cookies for these purposes. These cookies do not gather information about you that could be used for marketing purposes or remembering where you have been on the internet. If you no longer wish for us to remember your selections, please delete cookies on your machine. To find out about how to opt out of cookies, please see our 'how to refuse or opt out of cookies' section below.

**Customisation Cookies**

We also use cookies to change the way our website behave or look in order to personalise your experience from information we infer from your behaviour on our websites or information we already know about you e.g. because you are a registered customer. These cookies may be used to tailor the content, look and feel delivered to you on subsequent sessions to our websites. For example, if you personalise webpages, or register for products or services, a cookie helps our webpage server to recall your specific information. When you next visit our website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the website features that you previously chose. Even if you use more than one device or computer on a regular basis, we can link cookies together so you will still receive a personalised online experience. We can also personalise the information you see based on what we already know about you, so that you spend less time looking for things. So, instead of one website for all website visitors, each visitor can have a website experience which is unique to them.

It is entirely up to you if you wish to have a customised experience on our websites. To find out about how to opt out of cookies, please see our 'how to refuse or opt out of cookies' section below.

**Analytics Cookies**

We also use our own unique cookies and/or third party cookies for analytics purposes to analyse the use of our websites and enhance the performance of our websites. These cookies may be used for testing different designs and ensuring a consistent look and feel is maintained for users of our websites, track and provide trend analysis on how our users interact with our websites, track errors and track ads for advertising revenue purposes. The data collected will generally be aggregated to provide trends and usage patterns for business analysis, site/platform improvement and performance metrics. This analysis may be performed by third parties but will be for the review and benefit of Everything Everywhere only. The type of information we collect includes how many visitors visit our websites, how many customers log in, when they visited, for how long and which areas of our websites and services. This information allows us to continuously improve our services and develop them according to the taste of our customers and visitors. Your use of our websites indicates your consent to the use of these web analytics cookies. To find out about how to opt out of cookies, please see our 'how to refuse or opt out of cookies' section. Please note that you may experience functional problems if you delete these cookies.

**Advertising cookies**

We use various technologies including cookies and web beacons (also known as 'pixel tags') to serve ads when you visit our websites. These gather information about your visits to our websites and other websites within ad networks with whom we partner, which help us serve our ads and third party ads to you. In the course of serving these ads, our own unique cookies and/or third party cookies may be placed or recognised on your browser. In addition, we use web beacons, provided by our ad serving partners to help manage our online advertising. These web beacons enable our ad server to recognise a browser's cookie when a browser visits our website and to learn which banner ads bring users to our websites. If you are a registered user, the information collected from our websites is not anonymous and we may use this information along with other information we hold on you including your preferences to tailor content, services, advertising and offers for you. The information we collect and share with third parties through cookies is anonymous: it does not include your name, address, or any other information which is likely to identify you.

It is entirely up to you if you wish to receive tailored advertising. To find out about how to opt out of cookies, please see our 'how to refuse or opt out of cookies' section. Please also read about third party cookies.

**When we use cookies

We allocate cookies during the registration process for our services. These cookies will hold information collected during your registration and will allow us to recognise you as a customer and provide you with the services you require.

We may also use this data to better understand your interests while online and to personalise your visits to our websites.

**On different sections of our portal**

Our servers use two different types of cookies.

The first type is known as a 'session-based' cookie and is allocated to your computer only for the duration of your visit to our Web site. It helps you to move around the Web site faster and, if you're a registered customer, it allows us to give you information relevant to your selected service. This cookie automatically expires when you close down your browser.

The second type of cookie is known as a 'persistent' cookie. These cookies will remain on your computer for a period of time set for each cookie. These cookies allow us to:

• limit how often you see a particular advertisement or announcement on our web site;

• identify your preferences when customising content for you;

• provide you with relevant self-help information;

• record how many times you visit a page or advertisement;

• limit and record how often you can vote in our polls;

• confirm you are a registered user and save your login details when accessing certain services on our websites; and

• collect statistics on the use of our services.

We may also use cookies and web beacons to ensure that our mailing tools are working properly. Other companies which advertise or offer their products or services on our websites will also allocate cookies to your computer, over which we have no control. The types of cookies they use and how they use the information generated by them will be governed by those companies' privacy policies. We provide below a list of third parties with whom we have a business relationship. This list is not fully exhaustive and is updated by us from time to time.

Another form of website measurement and customisation technology is performed by the use of flash cookies which are created by Adobe Flash. To manage these cookies, visit [Macromedia's](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html "Macromedia's site") site.

## 8\. Security and Protection of Your Personal Information

We do our best to protect your personal details and other information about your account because we want you to feel completely confident about using our services. We are constantly reviewing our processes and procedures to protect your personal information from unauthorised access and use, accidental loss and/or destruction.

Sometimes we use other organisations to process your personal information on our behalf. We don't allow them to use this information for their own commercial purposes and they have to follow our strict instructions and comply with appropriate security measures.

We store all your account details and other such information on secure servers, adhering strictly to all relevant UK legislation. We use encrypted transmission links whenever we can.

**Contacting us by email or phone**

We recommend you set up a Customer Services password to protect your account details. If you don't already have one it's simple to set one up next time you call. Some customers may use a PIN as part of our automated telephone system. Once you have a PIN this is all you will need when you call us - though you'll still need your Customer Services password if you email. You must set up a Customer Services Password or PIN if you want anyone other than yourself to access your account.

If we need to call you for any reason we will not ask you to reveal your password to us.

**Reviewing your account online**

You will need to set up a separate username and password to access your account details online.

**Spoof websites and email security alerts**

Fraudsters create authentic looking, but false or "spoof" websites. Their purpose is to tempt users to divulge personal information. This information will be re-used to try and access your bank accounts. Fraudsters are increasingly turning to email to generate traffic to these websites.

If you get any email containing an embedded link and a request for you to enter any personal details, treat it as suspicious and do not provide any personal information, even if the page appears legitimate. No reputable company ever sends emails of this type.

**Identity fraud**

If you believe you may have fallen victim to identity fraud or impersonation, CIFAS (the UK's Fraud Prevention Service) advises you take the following steps:

• Obtain a copy of your credit file from the credit reference agencies (see the CIFAS Website at [www.identityfraud.org.uk](http://www.identityfraud.org.uk/) Advice for Victims for further details).

• Contact everyone involved immediately and keep a record of all of your actions (who you spoke to and when, copies of letters sent and received etc).

• Immediately report the incident to the police, especially if it involves stolen identification documents. Insist on receiving a Crime Reference Number or some documentation to record the incident.

• If a passport or driving licence is stolen or lost it should be reported to the authorities as soon as the loss is known. Also report any suspicious circumstances.

• Immediately report all stolen cheques or cards to the issuers, and request new ones. Follow up telephone calls with written notification. Get new cards, account numbers and PINs if you use credit or other plastic cards to access banking services. Don't continue to use a compromised PIN.

• Notify Royal Mail immediately if you suspect mail theft or suspect a mail redirection has been fraudulently set up on your address - they have an investigations unit who will be able to help.

If you believe you may have fallen victim (i.e. you have received a bill for an account or additional number which fraudulently uses your details), you should contact us as soon as possible.

## 9\. Location Services

We need to know approximately where you are so that we can deliver mobile phone services to you. Location information (such as your Cell ID) is relayed to us and some of our partners when your phone is turned on or when you use the services. This information will also be shared with the emergency services so that when you make an emergency call, the emergency services are able to respond more quickly to the call. Cell ID location information cannot usually be used to pinpoint exactly where you are.

For example, it cannot usually be used to determine which particular house or shop you are in at a given time. Instead it offers an approximate location based on your position relative to the nearest mobile phone masts. The accuracy of this information depends on how close you are to a mobile phone mast and is likely to be more accurate in urban areas compared to rural areas. This location information may also be used to provide you with services that are linked to your location such as traffic reports and entertainment listings.

We also use geo-fencing techniques to determine your location, using your last known location when you have entered a defined area, using information about your last known communication, using information on when you change location area outside of your current cell site and using your cell ID location when you switch your phone on. We use this information for location based offers when you have consented to receive offers based on your location and we keep this information for a maximum of 30 days (or less if you opt out of location based offers) and then delete it.

For map services, we generally use your GPS location if enabled on your phone and when available to us.

Some location services are called active location services because you are asking us to check your location in order for the service to be provided. There are other forms of location based services where you might agree to be located by someone else or you might want to locate someone else using the location information we generate. These services are called passive location services. We describe passive location based services offered by our partners below.

**Phone locator services**

We have put in place measures to ensure that our partners who provide you with passive location based services by using cell ID that we provide to them comply with the Industry Code of Practice for the Use of Mobile Phone Technology to Provide Passive Location Services in the UK. These include measures to verify the identity of the person wishing to use the passive location service and to ensure the ongoing consent of the person whose phone is being located. One of the key requirements of this Code is that the person who is to be located must consent to being located and regular reminders about the location service must be sent to their mobile phone so that they can opt out at any time.

**Other passive location services**

You may receive certain passive location services in circumstances where you have adjusted settings or activated certain features on your phone. For example, if your phone has 'Bluetooth' enabled, you may receive messages from third parties located nearby. If you do not wish to receive these services, we suggest you de-activate the relevant feature(s) on your phone or contact the third parties directly.

We use cookies to collect information from visitors and registered customers to our websites to help us improve the websites and services that we make available. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser settings to refuse cookies if you prefer. If you want to disable cookies, find out which browser you are using and follow the instructions below in our 'how to refuse or opt out of cookies' section Unfortunately, if you choose to decline cookies, some of the interactive features and some functionality of our websites may not be available to you. We advise regular users of our websites to accept cookies from us.

Different cookies are used to perform different functions. We detail below our use of cookies. Please note that our advertisers or third party websites to which we link may also use cookies over which we have no control.

**Our use of cookies

Essential Cookies

**

Some cookies are essential for us to use in order to provide you with the services you have requested. These cookies will be used to manage the delivery of any web services requested by you and if you do not accept these cookies you will not be able to receive the services that you have requested e.g. pay for goods and services or access secure areas of our websites. These cookies do not gather information about you that could be used for marketing purposes or remembering where you have been on the internet.

**Remembering your selections cookies**

We also use cookies to remember your selections that change the way our websites behave or look e.g. the font sizes or layout you have chosen etc. These types of cookies can also be used to deliver a specific function requested by you which is not core to the usage of the website e.g. streaming a video. Please note that if you delete these cookies, we will no longer be able to remember your preferences or remember your log in details or provide you with the content you have requested. When selecting your choices for the first time we may ask you whether you want us to remember your choices and if you do this it will constitute consent of our use of cookies for these purposes. These cookies do not gather information about you that could be used for marketing purposes or remembering where you have been on the internet. If you no longer wish for us to remember your selections, please delete cookies on your machine. To find out about how to opt out of cookies, please see our 'how to refuse or opt out of cookies' section below.

**Customisation Cookies**

We also use cookies to change the way our website behave or look in order to personalise your experience from information we infer from your behaviour on our websites or information we already know about you e.g. because you are a registered customer. These cookies may be used to tailor the content, look and feel delivered to you on subsequent sessions to our websites. For example, if you personalise webpages, or register for products or services, a cookie helps our webpage server to recall your specific information. When you next visit our website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the website features that you previously chose. Even if you use more than one device or computer on a regular basis, we can link cookies together so you will still receive a personalised online experience. We can also personalise the information you see based on what we already know about you, so that you spend less time looking for things. So, instead of one website for all website visitors, each visitor can have a website experience which is unique to them.

It is entirely up to you if you wish to have a customised experience on our websites. To find out about how to opt out of cookies, please see our 'how to refuse or opt out of cookies' section below.

**Analytics Cookies**

We also use our own unique cookies and/or third party cookies for analytics purposes to analyse the use of our websites and enhance the performance of our websites. These cookies may be used for testing different designs and ensuring a consistent look and feel is maintained for users of our websites, track and provide trend analysis on how our users interact with our websites, track errors and track ads for advertising revenue purposes. The data collected will generally be aggregated to provide trends and usage patterns for business analysis, site/platform improvement and performance metrics. This analysis may be performed by third parties but will be for the review and benefit of Everything Everywhere only. The type of information we collect includes how many visitors visit our websites, how many customers log in, when they visited, for how long and which areas of our websites and services. This information allows us to continuously improve our services and develop them according to the taste of our customers and visitors. Your use of our websites indicates your consent to the use of these web analytics cookies. To find out about how to opt out of cookies, please see our 'how to refuse or opt out of cookies' section. Please note that you may experience functional problems if you delete these cookies.

**Advertising cookies**

We use various technologies including cookies and web beacons (also known as 'pixel tags') to serve ads when you visit our websites. These gather information about your visits to our websites and other websites within ad networks with whom we partner, which help us serve our ads and third party ads to you. In the course of serving these ads, our own unique cookies and/or third party cookies may be placed or recognised on your browser. In addition, we use web beacons, provided by our ad serving partners to help manage our online advertising. These web beacons enable our ad server to recognise a browser's cookie when a browser visits our website and to learn which banner ads bring users to our websites. If you are a registered user, the information collected from our websites is not anonymous and we may use this information along with other information we hold on you including your preferences to tailor content, services, advertising and offers for you. The information we collect and share with third parties through cookies is anonymous: it does not include your name, address, or any other information which is likely to identify you.

It is entirely up to you if you wish to receive tailored advertising. To find out about how to opt out of cookies, please see our 'how to refuse or opt out of cookies' section. Please also read about third party cookies.
