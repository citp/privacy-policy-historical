# Privacy Policy

* * *

Eeggs.com and its advertisers and affiliates are deeply committed to protecting the privacy of our visitors. Below is information outlining our continued support for the responsible management of consumer information. 

Third Party Advertising

This site, The Easter Egg Archive, uses the services of third parties for the serving and/or targeting of ads, promotions and other marketing messages. To do this, they may collect anonymous data through the use of cookies. Third parties we work with include, but are not limited to [Google](https://www.google.com/adsense/), [BURST! Media](http://www.burstmedia.com/), and [Fastclick](http://www.fastclick.com/). Please refer to their sites for their respective privacy policies. 

Consumer Information 

Eeggs.com uses cookies to store authentication information when you are logged in. A login is not required for most features of the site. 

The only information we collect is completely voluntary. When you "register" with us, we collect a small amount of information such as your name and email address. This is not used for any purpose other than allowing the webmaster and/or other visitors contact you regarding the Eggs and comments you publicly post. You will not receive any unsolicited bulk email, and your information will not be given or sold to third parties. 

Data Collection and Opt Out Procedure 

Since the only data we collect is completely voluntary, the average visitor doesn't have to do anything to "opt out" of our data collection procedure. If, however, you are a registered user and you wish to be removed from our registration database, simply contact us using our [Feedback Form](https://web.archive.org/feedback.html). We can easily take you off the list. 

If you have any additional questions about Eeggs.com's privacy policies, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/feedback.html).
