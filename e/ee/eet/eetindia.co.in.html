<b>Collection of information.</b><p></p><br>
When you visit our website, we do not collect personally identifiable information about you except when you specifically and knowingly provide it. For instance, while many areas of our website are free to all users, we do require registration for some services such as [ eeNews,  Events Reminder, and Request for Free Ticket].

We may use the information you provide to respond to your requests for additional information, to contact you, if necessary, to service your account or for other administrative purposes.

<br><b>Co-branded and alliance relationships.</b><p></p><br>
We have established relationships with other parties on the Internet to offer you the benefit of other products and services which we ourselves do not offer. We offer you access to these other parties either through the use of hyperlinks to their sites from our site, or through offering "co-branded" sites in which both ourselves and these other parties share the same URL, domain name or pages within a domain name on the Internet. Generally, we do not own the co-branded and alliance parties and we do not control how they use any information you supply them. It is therefore important that you understand their privacy policy and/or terms of use if you visit and use their sites.<p></p>

<br><b>Third party service providers.</b><p></p><br>

You may notice that some services available through our website are "Powered by" or "Provided by" other third party content or technology service providers.

To fully access and use such services, you may sometimes be required to register for them or to otherwise provide certain information and data. In order to provide you with the services in question, such information and data may have to be made available to the third party provider, who may then process or update such information and data and transmit them back to us. We are highly selective in choosing these third party providers, and they are allowed to use your information and data only for the purpose of and in connection with providing the services which we have contracted with them to provide.<p></p>

<br><i><u>Important Notice</u></i><br>
<i>Although we adhere to industry standard practices to protect your personal information and confidential data, we cannot ensure that such information and data will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.</i><p></p><p></p>




<br><b>COOKIES</b> <br>
<br>
<b>What is a cookie? </b><br>
A cookie is a text-only string of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk, so as to help the website remember who you are, amongst other things. <br>
<br>
A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number. <br>
<br>
<b>Use of cookies on our website </b><br>
Cookies help us to arrange content to match your preferred interests more quickly, and to make our website more convenient and useful to you. Most major websites use cookies. <br>
<br>
Cookies cannot be used by themselves to identify you. Nor will acceptance of cookies on our website result in you receiving any e-mail from us. However, when you signed up for our services, you may have chosen to receive promotional or other types of e-mails from us. To check or update this choice, please see your applicable User Profile. <br>
<br>
Two types of cookies are used on our website: <br>
<br>
Session Cookies: These are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the website. <br>
<br>
Persistent Cookies: These are stored in your computer and remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer. The storage period will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie. <br>
<br>
<b>How and why we use cookies on our website and what information we collect </b><br>
<br>
Session Cookies: <li>To allow you to access stored information within a registration process. </li><br>
<li>To allow you to carry information across pages of our website and avoid you having to re-enter information. For example, to help automatically fill in your inquiry or other forms with your contact and other applicable details. </li><br>
<li>To save or record your user ID and/or password (at your option), so that you do not have to repeatedly log-in when you visit our website.</li> <br>
<li>To allow you to maintain an inquiry basket, and to help us determine which of our active supplier community members you are addressing your inquiries to. </li><br>
<li>To identify you as a member, customer or referred user of an alliance or business partner, when you log-in using a unique reference code previously issued to you. </li><br>
<li>To determine if you have already visited or logged-in to our website. </li><br>
<li>To record the category or type of user to which you belong, based upon the services for which you have registered, subscribed or paid for. </li><br>
<li>To determine which of our relevant computer servers you will be directed to. </li><br>
<li>To ensure that you do not receive "pop-up" banners or advertisements, if you have opted not to receive such "pop-ups" during the session. </li><br>
<li>To compile anonymous, aggregated statistics that allow us to understand how users use our website and to help us improve the structure, services and features of our website. You will not be personally identified in this way.  </li><br>
<br>
<br>
Persistent Cookies: <li>To help us recognize you as a unique visitor when you return to our website, for trend reports and analysis, or to allow us to tailor content to match your preferred interests, or to avoid or minimize showing you the same content repeatedly.</li> <br>
<li>To save or record your user ID and/or password (at your option), so that you do not have to repeatedly log-in when you visit our website. </li><br>
<li>To help our system identify who you are, if you have opted to "remember me" during the log-in process. </li><br>
<li>To compile anonymous, aggregated statistics that allow us to understand how users use our website and to help us improve the structure, services and features of our website. You will not be personally identified in this way. </li><br>
<li>Within research surveys, to ensure you are not invited to complete a questionnaire too often, or after you have already done so. </li><br>
<br>
<br>
Third Party Cookies: <li>Third parties serve cookies through this website. These are used for counting the number of anonymous users referred to our website by the third parties. These cookies do not carry any personally identifiable information and are merely used to track the effectiveness of a particular campaign.</li> <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Web Beacons </b><br>
Some pages on our website may contain images known as "web beacons" (also known as "clear gifs"), some of which may be served by third parties. They allow us to count users who have viewed these pages. Web beacons collect only limited information, including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the web beacon resides. These web beacons do not carry any personally identifiable information and are merely used to track the effectiveness of a particular campaign. <br>
