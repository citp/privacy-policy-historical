  <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
  <p><strong>HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY</strong> </p>
  <p>This privacy policy tells you how we collect, use, and protect your 
  personal information. By visiting our website, you accept and agree to the 
  terms and conditions of this privacy policy. In particular, you consent to our 
  collection and use of your personal information as described in this privacy 
  policy.</p>
  <p><strong>MINORS</strong></p>
  <p>We do not provide services or sell products to children. If you are below 
  the age of 18, you may use our website only with the permission and active 
  involvement of a parent or legal guardian. If you are a minor, please do not 
  provide us or other website visitors with any personal information.</p>
  <p><strong>POLICY IS PART OF OUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE</strong></p>
  <p>Our privacy policy is part of, and subject to, our website's terms and 
  conditions of use. You may view these terms and conditions on our website.</p>
  <p><strong>THE TYPE OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU</strong></p>
  <p>Like most places on the Internet, simply by visiting our website you 
  automatically tell us certain information. This includes basic information 
  such as your IP address, when you visited, the website from where you came 
  prior to visiting us, the website where you go when you leave our website, 
  your computer's operating system, and the type of web browser that you are 
  using. Our website automatically records this basic information about you.</p>
  <p>And like many other websites, we may use cookies. In plain English, this 
  means information that our website's server transfers to your computer. This 
  information can be used to track your session on our website. Cookies may also 
  be used to customize our website content for you as an individual. If you are 
  using one of the common Internet web browsers, you can set up your browser to 
  either let you know when you receive a cookie or to deny cookie access to your 
  computer.</p>
  <p>We may also collect any data that you provide us by posting it at our 
  website or by e-mail. You can always choose not to provide us with 
  information. However, if you do withhold information, we may deny you access 
  to some or all of our website's services and features.</p>
  <p>Some transactions between you and our website may involve payment by credit 
  card, debit card, checks, money orders, and/or third party online payment 
  services. In such transactions, we will collect information related to the 
  transaction as part of the course of doing business with you, including your 
  billing address, telephone number, and other information related to the 
  transaction.</p>
  <p><strong>WHAT WE DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
  <p>We use your information to operate our website's business activities. For 
  example, we may use this data to contact you about changes to our website, new 
  services, or special offers, resolve disputes, troubleshoot issues, and 
  enforce our website's terms and conditions.</p>
  <p>As a general rule, we will not give your data to third parties without your 
  permission. However, there are some important exceptions to this rule that are 
  described in the following paragraphs.</p>
  <p>We may, in our sole discretion, provide information about you to law 
  enforcement or other government officials for purposes of fraud 
  investigations, alleged intellectual property infringement, or any other 
  suspected illegal activity or matters that may expose us to legal liability.</p>
  <p>Although we do not disclose individually identifiable information, we may 
  disclose aggregate data about our website's visitors to advertisers or other 
  third parties for marketing and promotional purposes.</p>
  <p>From time to time, we may use third party suppliers to provide services on 
  our website. If a supplier wants to collect information about you, you will be 
  notified. However, you will never be required to give information to a third 
  party supplier. We restrict the way third party suppliers can use your 
  information. They are not allowed to sell or give your information to others.</p>
  <p><strong>USER NAMES AND PASSWORDS</strong></p>
  <p>Your access to parts of our website may be protected by a user name and a 
  password. Do not give your password to anyone. If you enter a section of our 
  website that requires a password, you should log out when you leave. As a 
  safety precaution, you should also close out of your web browser completely 
  and re-open it before viewing other parts of the Internet.</p>
  <p><strong>YOUR USE OF INFORMATION AND UNSOLICITED JUNK E-MAIL</strong></p>
  <p>If you obtain personally identifiable information about another website 
  user, you are not allowed to disclose this information to anyone else without 
  the consent of the user and our consent too.</p>
  <p>We hate junk e-mail (Spam). Information you obtain from our website about 
  us or other site users cannot be used by you or others to send unsolicited 
  commercial e-mail or to send unsolicited commercial communications via our 
  website's posting or other communication systems. </p>
  <p><strong>YOUR VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES WHO ARE 
  NOT OUR SUPPLIERS</strong></p>
  <p>You may choose to provide personal information to website visitors or other 
  third parties who are not our suppliers. Please use caution when doing so. The 
  privacy policies and customs of these third parties determine what is done 
  with your information.</p>
  <p><strong>AUTORESPONDERS</strong></p>
  <p>We may use autoresponders to communicate with you by e-mail. To protect 
  your privacy, we use a verified opt-in system for such communications and you 
  can always opt-out of such communications using the links contained in each 
  autoresponder message. If you have difficulties opting out, you may contact us
