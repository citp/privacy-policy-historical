Cookies may be used for various purposes, including to keep track of preferences you specify while you are using E!'s services and the Website.

E! allows other companies that are presenting advertisements on some of E!'s Website pages to set and access cookies on your computer. E! does not control cookies from third-party advertisers.

The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry.

Also, in the event that E! or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will be one of the transferred assets. 

**Children's Guidelines**  
E! does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13, nor does it contact children under the age of 13 about special offers or for marketing purposes without a parent’s permission. E! encourages parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet use. Also, E! strongly encourages parents to help E! enforce its Privacy Policy by instructing their children to never provide personal information on the Website without permission.

It is possible that due to fraud or deception by others, E! may unknowingly receive information pertaining to children under the age of 13.

**Consent to International Information Transfers**  
The Website is operated in the United States. While E! is committed to providing your information with a high level of privacy protection, you should know that the general level of protection for personal information in the United States may not be the same as that provided in other countries.

E! has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under E!’s control.
