                EonPay                (“
                EonPay                ” or “we”) may ask you to provide us information 
                about yourself and your credit card and/or bank account. This 
                Privacy Policy describes the information we collect and how we 
                use that information. 
                EonPay                takes the privacy of your personal information very seriously 
                and will use your information only in accordance with the terms 
                of this Privacy Policy. We will not sell or rent your personally 
                identifiable information or a list of our customers to third parties. 
                However, as described in more detail in Part C below, there are 
                limited circumstances in which some of your information will be 
                shared with third parties, under strict restrictions, so it is 
                important for you to review this Privacy Policy. This Privacy 
                Policy applies to all services that are hosted on the 
                EonPay                website, whether 
                EonPay                (or its subsidiaries or its affiliates) offers the services.<br>
                By accepting the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use in registration, 
                you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your personal 
                information in the manner described in this Privacy Policy. This 
                Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms of 
                the 
                EonPay                Terms of Use.<br>
                <br>
                Your personal information will be stored and processed on our 
                computers in the United States. The laws on holding personal data 
                in the United States may be less stringent than the laws of your 
                country, but 
                EonPay                will hold and transmit your personal information in a safe, confidential 
                and secure environment. If you object to your personal information 
                being transferred or used as described in this Privacy Policy,

                <strong>Notification of Changes</strong><br>
                This policy may be revised over time as new features are added 
                to the 
                EonPay                service or as we incorporate suggestions from our customers. If 
                we are going to use or disclose your personally identifiable information 
                in a manner materially different from that stated at the time 
                we collected the information, you will have a choice as to whether 
                or not we use or disclose your information in this new manner. 
                Any material changes will be effective only after we provide you 
                by e-mail with at least 30 days’ notice of the amended Privacy 
                Policy (if you have closed your 
                EonPay                account, you will not be contacted to notify you of the amended 
                Policy and your personal information will not be used or disclosed 
                in this new manner).<br>
                <br>
                We will post the amended Privacy Policy prominently on our website 
                so that you can always review what information we gather, how 
                we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it 
                to anyone. Please check the

              <blockquote> <strong>Required Information</strong><br>
                To open a 
                EonPay                account, you must provide your name, company name (if any), address, 
                phone number, home page (if any), and e-mail address. In order 
                to make payments through 
                EonPay                , you must provide credit card, debit card or bank account information. 
                We may also ask you to choose different security questions to 
                answer. This required information may be necessary for us to process 
                transactions, issue a new password if you forget or lose your 
                password, protect you against credit card fraud and checking account 
                fraud, and to contact you should the need arise in administering 
                your account.<br>
                <br>
                In order to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act, we will also require 
                your SSN or TIN if you send or receive certain high-value transactions 
                or high overall payment volumes through 
                EonPay                . If you choose to register or apply for certain optional features 
                or products offered through the 
                EonPay                websites, you will be required to provide additional information 
                to establish that you qualify for such features or products.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Transaction Information</strong><br>
                When you use 
                EonPay                to send money to someone else or request money from someone else, 
                we ask you to provide information related to each transaction, 
                including the amount of the transaction and the e-mail address 
                of the third party. We retain this information for each of your 
                transactions through 
                EonPay                . We also collect the Internet address (IP address) of the computer 
                or device you use to access your 
                EonPay                account, in order to help detect possible instances of unauthorized 
                transactions.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Information About You From Third Parties</strong><br>
                In order to protect all our customers against potential fraud, 
                we verify with third parties the information you provide. In the 
                course of such verification, we receive personally identifiable 
                information about you from such services. In particular, if you 
                register a credit card or debit card with 
                EonPay                , we may use card authorization and fraud screening services to 
                verify that your card information and address matches the information 
                that you supplied to 
                EonPay                , and that the card has not been reported as lost or stolen.<br>
                <br>
                If you send or receive high overall payment volumes through 
                EonPay                , in some circumstances we may conduct a background check on your 
                business by obtaining information about you and your business 
                from a credit bureau or a business information service. If you 
                incur a debt to 
                EonPay                , we will generally conduct a credit check on you by obtaining 
                additional information about you from a credit bureau, to the 
                extent permitted by law. 
                EonPay                , at its sole discretion, also reserves the right periodically 
                to retrieve and review a business or consumer credit report for 
                any account, and reserves the right to close an account based 
                on information obtained during this credit review process.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Additional Verification</strong><br>
                If we cannot verify the information that you provide, or if you 
                request a withdrawal by check to an address other than your verified 
                credit card billing address, we may ask you to send us additional 
                information (such as your drivers’ license, credit card 
                statement, and/or a recent utility bill or other information linking 
                you to the applicable address), or to answer additional questions 
                online to help verify your information.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Website Traffic Information</strong><br>
                Because of the way that Internet communication standards work, 
                when you arrive at or leave the 
                EonPay                website, we automatically receive the Internet address of the 
                site that you came from or are going to. We also collect information 
                on which pages of our website you visit while you are on the 
                EonPay                site, the type of browser you use and the times you access our 
                website. We may use this information only to try to understand 
                our customers’ preferences better and to manage the load 
                on our servers, so as to improve our service and your experience 
                with 
                EonPay                . We do not track the websites that you visit before or after 
                you leave the 
                EonPay                site.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Our Use of “Cookies”</strong><br>
                “Cookies” are small files of data that reside on your 
                computer and allow us to recognize you as a 
                EonPay                customer if you return to the 
                EonPay                site using the same computer and browser. We send a “session 
                cookie” to your computer if and when you log in to your 
                EonPay                account by entering your e-mail address and password. These cookies 
                allow us to recognize you if you visit multiple pages in our site 
                during the same session, so that you don’t need to re-enter 
                your password multiple times. Once you log out or close your browser, 
                these session cookies expire and no longer have any effect.<br>
                <br>
                We also use longer-lasting cookies to display your e-mail address 
                on our sign-in form, so that you don’t have to retype the 
                e-mail address each time when you log in to your 
                EonPay                account. In addition, we use cookies to process our referral program, 
                described in Section C below. We may share cookie information 
                regarding whether or not a certain user is already registered 
                with 
                EonPay                with certain merchants with whom we have an official co-marketing 
                relationship.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Customer Service Correspondence</strong><br>
                If you send us correspondence, we may retain such information 
                in the records of your account. We may also retain customer service 
                correspondence and other correspondence from 
                EonPay                to you. We may retain these records in order to measure and improve 
                our customer service, and to investigate potential fraud and violations 
                of our Terms of Use. We may, over time, delete these records if 
                permitted by law.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Questionnaires, Surveys and Profile Data</strong><br>
                From time to time, we may offer optional questionnaires and surveys 
                to our users for such purposes as collecting demographic information 
                or assessing users’ interests and needs. The use of the 
                information collected will be explained in detail in the survey 
                itself. If we collect personally identifiable information from 
                our users in these questionnaires and surveys, the users will 
                be given notice of how the information will be used prior to their 
                participation in the survey or questionnaire.<br>

                When a member either sends a payment to, or requests a payment 
                from, an individual who is not a registered member of 
                EonPay                , we will retain the information that the member submits to us, 
                including, for example, the other party’s email address 
                and/or name, for the benefit of the member who is attempting to 
                contact the non-member, so that the member can see a complete 
                record of his or her transactions, including uncompleted transactions. 
                Although this information is stored indefinitely, we will not 
                market to the non-member in any way at any time. Additionally, 
                these non-members have the same rights to access and correct information 
                about themselves (assuming that their email addresses were correct 
                enough to reach them) as anyone else who uses

                We collect, store and process your personal information on servers 
                located in the United States. We use the information we collect 
                about you in order to provide our services and process your transactions, 
                to provide customer service, to determine your eligibility to 
                receive offers for special features or products, and to improve 
                our products and services. At your option (as indicated in your 
                EonPay                user settings), we use the information you provide to access specific 
                third party services on your behalf and perform the actions that 
                you request us to perform.<br>
                <br>
                We give access to individually identifiable information about 
                our users only to those employees who require it to fulfill customer

                <strong>Disclosure to Other 
                EonPay                Customers</strong><br>
                If you are a registered 
                EonPay                user, your name, e-mail address, date of sign-up, and other information 
                may be displayed to other 
                EonPay                customers whom you have paid or who are attempting to pay you 
                through 
                EonPay                . Your credit card number, bank account and other financial information 
                will never be revealed to anyone whom you have paid or who has 
                paid you through 
                EonPay                , except if we are required to do so pursuant to a subpoena or 
                other legal process.<br>
                <br>
                If you are buying goods or services and paying through 
                EonPay                , the seller of the goods or services may request that you provide 
                a mailing address that 
                EonPay                has confirmed as matching the billing address in the credit card 
                system. You do not have to provide this information. If you do 
                not provide the information, however, the seller may choose not 
                to accept your 
                EonPay                payment and not to complete the transaction.<br>
                <br>
                EonPay                may also disclose to other 
                EonPay                customers the number of payments you have received from Verified 
                EonPay                customers (as defined in the Terms of Use on the <a class="href" href="http://www.eonpay.com">

                EonPay                will not sell or rent any of your personally identifiable information 
                to third parties. 
                EonPay                will not share any of your personally identifiable information 
                with third parties except in the limited circumstances described 
                below, or with your express permission (and to other 
                EonPay                customers as described above). These third parties are limited 
                by law or by contract from using the information for secondary 
                purposes beyond the purposes for which the information is shared. 
                We share information with companies that help us process the transactions 
                you request and protect our customers’ transactions from 
                fraud, such as sharing your credit card number with a service 
                that screens for lost and stolen card numbers. See “Information 
                About You From Third Parties” in Section B above. Additionally, 
                if you go into a negative balance and owe us money, we may share 
                information with processing companies including collection agencies.<br>
                <br>
                We disclose the information we collect, as described in Section 
                B above, to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf 
                or to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing 
                agreements. These companies may be subject to confidentiality 
                agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit 
                using the information except to market the specified 
                EonPay                -related products or services, unless you have affirmatively agreed 
                or given your prior permission for other uses.<br>
                <br>
                We disclose information that we in good faith believe is appropriate 
                to cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity, 
                or to conduct investigations of violations of our Terms of Use. 
                Specifically, this means that if we conduct a fraud investigation 
                and conclude that one side has engaged in deceptive practices, 
                we can give that person or entity’s contact information 
                (but not bank account or credit card information) to victims who 
                request it.<br>
                <br>
                We disclose information in response to a subpoena, warrant, court 
                order, levy, attachment, order of a court-appointed receiver or 
                other comparable legal process, including subpoenas from private 
                parties in a civil action.<br>
                <br>
                If a user signs up for a co-branded version of 
                EonPay                through links on our co-branded partner’s website, 
                EonPay                will share with the co-branded partner that user’s name, 
                e-mail address and physical address in order to provide enhanced 
                integration between 
                EonPay                ’s services and the services of our co-branded partner. 
                If a user does not want his or her information shared with 
                EonPay                ’s co-branded partner, he or she should not use this aspect 
                of the site.<br>
                <br>
                We disclose information to your agent or legal representative 
                (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or 
                a guardian appointed for you).<br>
                <br>
                We share aggregated statistical data with our business partners 
                or for public relations. For example, we may disclose that a specific 
                percentage of our users live in British Columbia. However, this 
                aggregated information is not tied to personally identifiable 
                information.<br>
                <br>
                As with any other business, it is possible that 
                EonPay                in the future could merge with or be acquired by another company. 
                If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have 
                access to the information maintained by 
                EonPay                , including customer account information, but would continue to 
                be bound by this Privacy Policy unless an until it is amended 
                as described in Section A above.<br>
                <br>
                We share your information with our parent, subsidiaries and joint 
                ventures to help coordinate the services we provide to you, enforce 
                our terms and conditions, and promote trust and safety.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Our Contacts with 
                EonPay                Customers</strong><br>
                We communicate with users on a regular basis via e-mail to provide 
                requested services, and we also communicate by phone to resolve 
                customer complaints or investigate suspicious transactions. We 
                use your e-mail address to confirm your opening of a 
                EonPay                account, to send you notice of payments that you send or receive 
                through 
                EonPay                (including referral payments described below), to send information 
                about important changes to our products and services, and to send 
                notices and other disclosures required by law. Generally, users 
                cannot opt out of these communications, but they will be primarily 
                informational in nature rather than promotional.<br>
                <br>
                We also may use your e-mail address to send you other types of 
                communications that you can control, including tips, newsletters, 
                customer surveys and notice of special third-party promotions. 
                You can choose whether to receive some, all or none of these communications 
                when you complete the registration process, or at any time thereafter, 
                by logging in to your account on the 
                EonPay                website and changing your user preferences. You can also change 
                your choices at any time through the same procedure.<br>
                <br>
                In connection with independent audits of our financial statements 
                and operations, auditors may seek to contact a sample of our customers 
                to confirm that our records are accurate. However, these auditors 
                cannot use personally identifiable information for any secondary 
                purposes.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Internet Address Information</strong><br>
                We use IP addresses, browser types and access times to analyze 
                trends, administer the site, improve site performance and gather 
                broad demographic information for aggregate use.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Your Use of Information and Our Services</strong><br>
                In order to facilitate the transactions between 
                EonPay                members, our service allows you limited access other users’ 
                contact information. As a seller you may have access to the User 
                ID, email address and other contact information of the purchaser, 
                and as a purchaser you may have access to the User ID, email address 
                and other contact information of the seller.<br>
                <br>
                By entering into our Terms of Use, you agree that, with respect 
                to other users’ personally identifiable information that 
                you obtain through the site or through an 
                EonPay                -related communication or 
                EonPay                -facilitated transaction, you will only use this information for: 
                (a) <a class="href" href="http://www.eonpay.com">
                http://www.eonpay.com                </a>-related communications that are not unsolicited commercial 
                messages, (b) using services offered through 
                EonPay                , and (c) any other purpose that such user expressly agrees to 
                after adequate disclosure of the purpose(s).<br>
                <br>
                In all cases, you must provide users with the opportunity to remove 
                themselves from your database and review any information you have 
                collected about them. In addition, under no circumstances, except 
                as defined in this Section, can you disclose personally identifiable 
                information about another <a class="href" href="http://www.eonpay.com">

                of such other user after adequate disclosure. Note that law enforcement 
                personnel and other rights holders are given different rights

                necessary in order to deter fraud, by ensuring that persons who

                by closing their account and opening a new account. However, if
