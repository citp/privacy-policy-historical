                <br>
                Anonymous   User Information: Emysearch collects some anonymous information each time you   visit our Websites so we can improve the overall quality of your online   experience. We collect your IP address, referral data, and browser and platform   type. You do not have to register with Emysearch before we can collect this   anonymous information. We do not collect any unique information about you (such   as your name, e-mail address, etc.) except when you specifically and knowingly   provide such information. Emysearch does not require you to share information that   identifies you personally, such as your name or email address, in order for you   to use the Website search. Emysearch assigns an anonymous ID number to your   requests and links the following additional data to that number: the date and   time you visited the Website, your search terms, and the links upon which you   choose to click. Like most standard Web site servers, we use log files to   collect and store this anonymous user information. We analyze this information   to examine trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate,   and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Emysearch may present   links in a format that enables us to understand whether they have been followed.   We use this information to understand and improve the quality of the Website   search. <br>
                <br>
                Cookies: We use a feature of Internet web browsers called a   "cookie," which is a small file that is sent to your computer when you visit a   website. This enables us to store user preferences and track user trends and   search patterns. We use cookies to improve the quality of the services and to   better understand how users interact with us. We do not and cannot use Cookies   to retrieve individual personally identifiable information about you from your   computer unless you knowingly and willingly provided such information. The   cookie technology we use cannot obtain information from your hard drive or pass   on a computer virus. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to   indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some Website features or services   may not function properly without cookies. <br>
                <br>
                Information Security: We take   appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or   unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. We restrict access   to your personally identifying information to employees who need to know that   information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. <br>
                <br>
                Aggregated General Information: We may share aggregated general   information about our site with our corporate partners or others.
