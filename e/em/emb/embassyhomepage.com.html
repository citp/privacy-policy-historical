<b>Purchases:</b> Embassyhomepage.com does not sell you products, but directs you to sites that do. These sites may store information such as your name and address and credit card details. They may operate their own privacy policies.
<br><br>
<span class="h5">YouTube cookies</span><br>

<br><br>
<span class="h5">Search engine</span><br>
The search engine on our website is designed to be as powerful and easy to use as the popular search engine Google. The search is made possible by a piece of hardware (a search �appliance�) supplied by Google that is plugged into our server and continuously indexes the content on our site. All search requests are handled by the appliance and the information is not passed on to any third party, including Google.
<br><br>
<b>E-newsletters and Auto Responders</b><br>
We use a third party provider, AWeber, to deliver our e-newsletters and email auto responder services. We gather statistics around email opening and clicks using industry standard technologies including clear gifs to help us monitor and improve our e-newsletters and email marketings. For more information, please see AWeber’s privacy notice.
<br><br>
<span class="h5">People who call our call centres</span><br>
When you call the Embassyhomepage.com’s call centre we collect Calling Line Identification (CLI) information. We use this information to help improve its efficiency and effectiveness.<br><br>
Our call centre phone line also offers a translation service for customers when English is not their first language, this is provided by a third party company. The company that provides this service does not retain any information from the calls or record them.
<br><br>
<span class="h5">People who make a complaint to us</span><br>
When we receive a complaint from a person we make up a file containing the details of the complaint. This normally contains the identity of the complainant and any other individuals involved in the complaint.
<br><br>
We will only use the personal information we collect to process the complaint and to check on the level of service we provide. We do compile and publish statistics showing information like the number of complaints we receive, but not in a form which identifies anyone.
<br><br>
We usually have to disclose the complainant’s identity to whoever the complaint is about. This is inevitable where, for example, the accuracy of a person’s record is in dispute. If a complainant does not want information identifying him or her to be disclosed, we will try to respect that. However, it may not be possible to handle a complaint on an anonymous basis.
<br><br>
We will keep personal information contained in complaint files in line with our retention policy. This means that information relating to a complaint may be retained for up to four years from closure. It will be retained in a secure environment and access to it will be restricted according to the ‘need to know’ principle.
<br><br>
Similarly, where enquiries are submitted to us we will only use the information supplied to us to deal with the enquiry and any subsequent issues and to check on the level of service we provide.
<br><br>
When we take enforcement action against someone, we may publish the identity of the defendant in our Annual Report or elsewhere. Usually we do not, identify any complainants unless the details have already been made public.
<br><br>
<span class="h5">People who use Embassyhomepage.com services</span><br>
The Embassyhomepage.com offers various services to the public. We use a third party to deal with some publication requests, but they are only allowed to use the information to send out the publications.
<br><br>
We have to hold the details of the people who have requested the service in order to provide it. However, we only use these details to provide the service the person has requested and for other closely related purposes. For example, we might use information about people who have requested a publication to carry out a survey to find out if they are happy with the level of service they received. When people do subscribe to our services, they can cancel their subscription at any time and are given an easy way of doing this.
<br><br>
<span class="h5">People who ‘notify’ under the Data Protection Act 1998</span><br>
We are required by law to ‘notify’ certain specified information to the Information Commissioner in each country we operate. This may contain personal information.
<br><br>
When we are asked to fill in their notification forms to the Information Commissioner, we need to provide the contact details of a relevant member of staff.
<br><br>
<b>Job applicants, current and former employees of Embassyhomepage.com or its parent company</b>
<br>
When individuals apply to work at Embassyhomepage.com or its parent company, we will only use the information they supply to us to process their application and to monitor recruitment statistics. Where we want to disclose information to a third party, for example where we want to take up a reference or obtain a ‘disclosure’ from the Criminal Records Bureau we will not do so without informing them beforehand unless the disclosure is required by law.
<br><br>
Personal information about unsuccessful candidates will be held for 12 months after the recruitment exercise has been completed, it will then be destroyed or deleted. We retain de-personalised statistical information about applicants to help inform our recruitment activities, but no individuals are identifiable from that data.
<br><br>
Once a person has taken up employment with the Embassyhomepage.com or its parent company, we will compile a file relating to their employment. The information contained in this will be kept secure and will only be used for purposes directly relevant to that person�s employment. Once their employment with Embassyhomepage.com or its parent company has ended, we will retain the file in accordance with the requirements of our retention schedule and then delete it.
<br><br>
<span class="h5">Access to personal information</span><br>
Embassyhomepage.com tries to be as open as it can be in terms of giving people access to their personal information. Individuals can find out if we hold any personal information by making a ‘subject access request’ under the latest Data Protection Act. If we do hold information about you we will:
<br>
give you a description of it;<br>
tell you why we are holding it;<br>
tell you who it could be disclosed to; and<br>
let you have a copy of the information in an intelligible form.<br><br>
To make a request to the Embassyhomepage.com for any personal information we may hold you need to put the request in writing addressing it to our Information Governance department, or writing to the address provided below.
<br><br>
If you agree, we will try to deal with your request informally, for example by providing you with the specific information you need over the telephone.
<br><br>
If we do hold information about you, you can ask us to correct any mistakes by, once again, contacting the <a href="../contact_us" class="l4">Information Governance department</a>.
<br><br>
<span class="h5">Disclosure of personal information</span><br>
In many circumstances we will not disclose personal data without consent.
