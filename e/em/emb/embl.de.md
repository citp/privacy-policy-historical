# EMBL Privacy Policy - EMBL

The European Molecular Biology Laboratory (“EMBL”) is a basic research institute funded by public research monies from 20 member states (Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom) and associate member state Australia.

Research at EMBL is conducted by approximately 95 independent groups covering the spectrum of molecular biology. The Laboratory is located on five sites: the main Laboratory in Heidelberg/Germany, and Outstations in Hinxton/England (the European Bioinformatics Institute), Grenoble/France, Hamburg/Germany, and Monterotondo/Italy near Rome. The cornerstones of EMBL’s mission are: to perform basic research in molecular biology; to train scientists, students and visitors at all postgraduate levels; to offer vital services to scientists in the member states; to develop new instruments and methods in the life sciences and to actively engage in technology transfer activities.

EMBL operates a number of websites in pursuance of its mission. In addition, scientists and others working at EMBL may publish their personal or group websites under the umbrella of the EMBL website. This EMBL Website Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes our practices for handling personal information and communicated through official EMBL websites or received via e-mail.

EMBL is committed to safeguarding your personal information. Some EMBL web pages contain hyperlinks to websites owned and operated by third parties. These third party websites have their own privacy policies, including cookies, and we urge you to review them. They will govern the use of personal information you submit or that is collected by cookies when you visit these websites. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for the privacy practices of such third party websites and your use of such websites is at your own risk.  

## i. Categories of personal data collected

When you participate in, access or sign up to any of our scientific services, activities or online content, for instance if you create an account with one of our services, we may receive personal information about you. Depending on the activity, this can consist of information such as your name, email address and more rarely postal address, or your telephone or mobile number. In particular, if you submit data to one of our databases (e.g. the European Nucleotide Archive) or create an account on one of our project portals we require a valid email address to create the account. By submitting your details, you enable us to provide you with the services, activities or online content you select.

We also use cookies (see [section vi](https://web.archive.org/web/20140629135952id_/http%3A//www.embl.de/aboutus/privacy_policy/index.html#cookies "EMBL Privacy Policy") below for details) and collect IP addresses (an IP address is a number that can uniquely identify a specific computer or other network device on the internet) from visitors to our websites.

### Categories of personal data collected include the following:

  * Email
  * Name and address details
  * Phone details
  * Job function and employer details/institutional affiliation
  * Gender and nationality for statistical reporting purposes in respect of our grant giving bodies, as well as for recruitment statistics along with an applicant’s age

## vi. Cookies

### a. What is a cookie?

A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer or mobile phone (referred to here as a "device") browser from a website's computer and is stored on your device's hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other websites. Many websites do this whenever a user visits their website in order to track online traffic flows.

On EMBL's websites (including EMBL-EBI’s websites), cookies record information about your online preferences and allow us to tailor the websites to your interests. Users have the opportunity to set their devices to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. The last of these means that the user cannot then be provided with certain personalised features and accordingly the user may not be able to take full advantage of all of the website's features. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.

During the course of any visit to an EMBL website, the pages you see, along with a cookie, are downloaded to your device. Many websites do this, because cookies enable website publishers to do useful things like find out whether the device (and probably its user) has visited the website before. This is done on a repeat visit by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last visit.

### b. How do we use cookies?

Information supplied by cookies can help us to analyse the profile of our visitors and help us to provide you with a better user experience. For example, if on a previous visit to our website you went to our nucleotide data pages, we might find this out from your cookie and highlight information about the nucleotide databases on your second and subsequent visits.

### c. Third party cookies on our pages

Please note that during your visits to our websites you may notice some cookies that are not related to EMBL. When you visit a page with content embedded from, for example, YouTube, you may be presented with cookies from these websites. EMBL does not control the dissemination of these cookies. You should check the third party websites for more information about these.

### d. EMBL cookies and how to reject cookies?

A list of the main cookies that EMBL websites set (and what each is used for) together with ways to minimise the number of cookies you receive can be found at EMBL's [Cookie List and How To Reject Cookies](https://web.archive.org/web/20140629135952id_/http%3A//www.embl.de/aboutus/privacy_policy/cookies_list/index.html "EMBL cookies list").

## vii. Offensive or inappropriate content on our websites

If you post or send offensive, inappropriate or objectionable content anywhere on or to our websites or otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour on any of our services, we may use your personal information to stop such behaviour.

Where we reasonably believe that you are or may be in breach of any of the laws of the country of origin of your IP address (e.g. because content you have posted may be defamatory), we may use your personal information to inform relevant third parties such as your employer, school email/internet provider or law enforcement agencies about the content and your behaviour.
