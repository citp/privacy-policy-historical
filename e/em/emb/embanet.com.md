# Privacy Policy | Pearson Embanet

## Privacy Policy

**Embanet** is committed to protecting your privacy when you visit our Web sites. We reserves the right to append or modify this Privacy Statement at anytime; we ask that you re-visit our Privacy Statement to check for updates or changes.

**We may use and disclose your personal information:**

  * for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy; or
  * for any additional purposes for which we have obtained your consent to the use or disclosure of your personal information.
  * we may use or disclose your personal information without your knowledge or consent where we are legally permitted or required to do so.



**When do we Disclose Your Personal Information?**  
We may share your personal information with our employees, contractors, consultants and other parties who require that information to assist us with managing our relationship with you, including third parties that provide services to us or on our behalf.

In addition, personal information may be disclosed or transferred to another party during the course of, or completion of a sale of EmbanetC (or its assets), a financing of Embanet, the acquisition of Embanet of another business, or any other form of business transaction, combination, merger or joint venture. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that those parties to whom your personal information is disclosed are required to use and disclose your personal information only in a manner consistent with the use and disclosure provisions of this Privacy Policy, unless you consent otherwise.  
Further, your personal information may be disclosed: 

  * as permitted or required by applicable law or regulatory requirements; 
  * to comply with valid legal processes such as search warrants, subpoenas or court orders;
  * as part of Embanet’s regular reporting activities to its related companies;
  * to protect the rights and property of Embanet; 
  * during emergency situations or where necessary to protect the safety of a person or group of persons;
  * where the personal information is publicly available; or
  * with your consent.



**Your Consent is Important to Us**  
It is important to us that we collect, use or disclose your personal information where we have your consent to do so. Depending on the sensitivity of the personal information, your consent may be implied, deemed (using an opt-out mechanism) or express. Express consent can be given orally, electronically or in writing. Implied consent is consent that can reasonably be inferred from your action or inaction. For example, when you enter into an agreement with us, we will assume your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information for purposes related to the performance of that agreement and for any other purposes identified to you at the relevant time. 

Typically, we will seek your consent at the time that we collect your personal information. In certain circumstances, your consent may be obtained after collection but prior to our use or disclosure of your personal information. If we plan to use or disclose your personal information for a purpose not previously identified (either in this Privacy Policy or separately), we will endeavor to advise you of that purpose before such use or disclosure. As we have described above, we may collect, use or disclose your personal information without your knowledge or consent where we are permitted or required to do so by applicable law or regulatory requirements. 

**How is Your Personal Information Protected?**  
Embanet endeavors to maintain physical, technical and procedural safeguards that are appropriate to the sensitivity of the personal information in question. These safeguards are designed to prevent your personal information from loss and unauthorized access, copying, use, modification or disclosure.
