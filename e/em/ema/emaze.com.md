At Emaze, we believe in protecting the privacy of your personal and confidential information. We have gone to great lengths to ensure that your information is secure and use your information only in a manner necessary for you to use our site. We have a fairly simple privacy policy:

  1. We do NOT sell, rent or share your personal information with other companies for the purposes of marketing other products and services to you.
  2. We do NOT send marketing messages on behalf of other companies to you.
  3. We do NOT share your information with 3rd parties except as necessary to complete transactions on Emaze. This includes standard business activities such as processing credit cards. Even then, we disclose only the information necessary to facilitate the transaction.
  4. We only email you about Emaze-related matters, such as:
    * Status of your monthly subscription
    * Newsletters
    * Registration-related emails, such as verifying your email address
    * Special Emaze-related offers
    * Receipts for purchases
  5. We will NEVER call or email you and request your credit card, password or other personal information.
  6. If we receive a legally authorized request to release any information about your account, such as from law enforcement or related to a lawsuit, we will comply only if there is a sufficient legal order compelling us to do so. Where legally permitted, we will notify you beforehand.
