# Privacy Policy - Emarsys B2C Marketing Cloud

### Information Tracking and Usage

To the extent it is permitted by applicable laws, Emarsys eMarketing Systems AG (in the following referred to as “Emarsys” or “we”) tracks and gathers certain information on this website that helps us to better understand our visitors’ needs related to our website and our services. We will never share this information with third parties unless explicitly stated in this policy or ordered by a court of law.

### Request of Information

On some pages of our website users have the option to register for various Emarsys services – e.g. newsletter, download of whitepapers, etc. – using data capture forms. These forms usually require the user’s name, email address, company, as well as other information that is necessary to provide the requested service. The user may choose to provide additional non-mandatory information that enables us to provide a more personalized service. To the extent it is permitted by applicable laws, we may also directly contact website users on the basis of the information they have provided in order to promote Emarsys’ products. In case of requests form countries in which are not handled by Emarsys itself but by affiliated companies or other representatives, we may also transfer the data to the responsible affiliated company or representative for said purpose (in each case only to the extent it is permitted by applicable laws). The users can object to the use of their data as described above at any time.

### Cookies

Our website uses “cookies”. Cookies help us understand our visitors’ needs and interests, and we use that information to improve our website and the services offered on the individual pages. They are not linked to any personally identifiable information. If a user rejects the cookie, our site may still be used, however the user’s access to some areas of our website may be limited.

A “cookie” is a small text file containing a random and unique identifier that either Emarsys or a business partner, such as a third party web analytics provider, transfers to your computer through your web browser (unless you set your browser to reject cookies). Emarsys uses cookies to, among other things, recognize your browser, track your movement through the Web site, track point of entry to point of registration for those users signing up for mailings or programs and track and measure the success of a particular marketing campaign.

Emarsys specifically uses Google Analytics and Retargeting cookies to allow 3rd party service providers to provide advertisements on our behalf across the Internet. These service providers may collect your IP address and non-personally identifiable information about your visits. This is completely anonymous and does not include your name, address, email address or other personal information. Additionally, these cookies are used to gather anonymous statistical information on how the website is browsed. These cookies will expire after 10 years.

You can block cookies by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse the setting of all or some cookies. For more information about cookies, including how to set your internet browser to reject cookies, please go to [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/) or [http://www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/). You can specifically opt-out of Google Analytics using [this tool](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

### Shared Usage of Data

We reserve the right to share accumulated, general demographic data for statistical purposes with selected partners. These data do not contain any personally identifiable information.

### Links

This website contains links to other sites. Please note that Emarsys is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any other websites to which we link.

### Other Types of Information Gathering

Occasionally our website gathers visitors’ data via temporary marketing activities such as seminars, free trial accounts, surveys, etc. Participation in these activities is on a voluntary basis, which allows the visitor to decide whether to disclose any personal data or not. Such data may include contact information (e.g. name, email, phone number), demographic information (e.g. zip code, date of birth) or others. The data will be used to provide the visitor with the service requested. Data gathered via surveys will be used for improving our website and services.

### Changing/Editing Personal Information

Every email sent by Emarsys allows the user to change, edit or remove any information he provided to us at the time of registration for an Emarsys service or the contact request on the website.

### Unsubscribe

Users who wish to no longer receive our newsletter or promotional emails may click on a link named “Unsubscribe” which is embedded with every email sent by Emarsys in order to not receive future messages.

### Referral Service

If a visitor decides to use our referral service in order to inform a friend or colleague about our website, we request the name and email address of the recipient. Following this, Emarsys sends exactly one automated message to the friend or colleague, with an invitation to visit our website. Emarsys does not store the corresponding data.

### External Service Providers

For certain activities related to this website we have retained the services of external data processors (e.g. data centers). These service providers process data only in accordance with our instructions, are therefore also bound by this privacy policy, and are subject to our control. Under no circumstances may these service providers use any data that are collected and processed in relation to this website for their own purposes.

### Notification in Case of Policy Change

Should we decide to change our privacy policy, we will notify users of such changes on our website. This keeps our users up to date about which information we gather, how we use this information, whether that information is disclosed to third parties, and if yes, in which way.
