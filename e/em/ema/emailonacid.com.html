    <h2>Browsing</h2>
    <p>
        We have not configured this website to collect any personal information from your computer when browsing this site.
        This means that, unless you voluntarily and knowingly provide us with personal information, we will not know your name, your email address, or any other information identifiable to you.
        An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer every time you browse the Internet.
        When users request a page from our site, our servers log the user's current IP address. We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems. We do not link IP addresses to any personal information about you.
    </p>
    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>
        Our website uses "cookie" technology. "Cookies" are encrypted strings of text that a website stores on a user's computer. Our website requires the use of cookies in order to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Recognize return visitors;</li>
        <li>Prevent the same user from making repeated enrollments in our Email on Acid membership program </li>
        <li>Store and recall user preferences and identify which of our web pages are most useful for our visitors; and</li>
        <li>Measure usage of our site and the various pages on the site. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The type of cookies that we use are referred to as "persistent" cookies because they remain on a user's computer hard drive until they are deleted by the user.
        We do not use cookies to gather information concerning your visits to other sites, nor ascertain any personal information about you apart from your dealings with <a href="https://www.emailonacid.com/">www.emailonacid.com</a>.
        Cookies do not corrupt or damage your computer or computer files.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you do not wish to receive these cookies, you may set your browser to reject the cookies (consult the instructions for your particular browser on how to do this),
        although doing so may affect your ability to perform certain transactions on our website.
    </p>
    <h2>Information We Collect and How We Use It</h2>
    <p>
        When we need to collect information from you, we will ask you to voluntarily supply us with the information we need.
        For example, if you would like to sign up as a member on our website, we will ask you for information such as name, address, telephone number, email address,
        credit card type, credit card number, expiration date in order to process your request. We will use your email address to send a confirmation and,
        if necessary, might use the other information to contact you for help in processing your membership or specifically for membership maintenance purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may also ask you to fill out an online customer survey, to obtain your suggestions or comments about your use of Email on Acid products or services.
        Providing this information is voluntary and it is used only for the purpose for which the information was collected and is not used for direct marketing or shared with other companies.
        We treat the information you provide to us as confidential information. Because laws applicable to personal information may vary by country,
        we may put in place additional measures that vary depending on the applicable legal requirements.
        Information is generally processed and stored in the United States - where the Email on Acid site is being hosted.
    </p>
    <p>
        We also collect information about the usage of our site and its features, as well as data about our Email Analytics.
        This data may be used in aggregate form, but never in a way that would identify it with a user of our system. For example, site usage statistics may be used to help us improve our site.
    </p>

    <h2>Email Analytics Data</h2>
	<p>If you make use of our Advanced Email Analytics tool, we'll collect data on the recipients of your email campaigns. This data may include the email addresses of recipients, if you choose to use merge tag tracking. Email on Acid makes every effort to keep this date secure. This data is owned by you. In order to collect and display this data for you, you allow us access to it. You also allow us use of this data to aggregate (in a non-personally identifiable form) so that we can publish reports and improve our site.</p>

    <h2>Code Repair</h2>
    <p>In using our Code Repair service, if we do not have the capacity to manage the request volume, we reserve the right to provide the given email HTML to a 3rd party to help fix an email client rendering issue. The HTML is owned by you and we are only accessing and modifying the code to fix a rendering issue. The HTML or content of that email will not be shared outside of Email on Acid or the 3rd party service provider.</p>

    <h2>Account Security</h2>
    <p>
        Because we know that the security of your data is important, we have created a password system to provide account security.
        It is the user's responsibility to prevent unauthorized access by protecting their password and access to their computer when using our system.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is our goal to protect the privacy of your account, but we cannot guarantee complete security.
        Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user information.
        Please remember that you control the information that you input, upload or otherwise provide to our services and the data that is collected in connection with our Email Analytics.
    </p>
    <h2>Email</h2>
    <p>
        It is our intention to only send you email communications that will be useful to you and that you want to receive.
        When you create a personal profile on this website, we will occasionally contact you via email and provide information about products and offerings that may be of interest to you.
        These communications will typically relate to special Email on Acid offers and promotions.
        If you would prefer not to receive such emails you may indicate so in your profile on <a href="https://www.emailonacid.com/">www.emailonacid.com</a>.
        You are also provided with the opportunity to opt-out of future emails in every email message you receive from us.
    </p>
    <p>
        We use a third-party email service provider to send emails. This service provider is prohibited from using your email address for any other purpose.
    </p>
    <h2>Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</h2>
    <p>
        Email on Acid prohibits the sale or transfer of personal information for use without your approval.
    </p>
    <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
