# Privacy Policy

  


eMarketer takes the issue of privacy seriously. We let the user decide what information to give us, and explain exactly what is done with it. eMarketer will never sell, distribute, barter or transfer any personally-identifiable information obtained from a user to a third party. 

The uniform resource locators (URLs) covered under eMarketer's privacy policy include: [www.emarketer.com](http://www.emarketer.com/), [www2.emarketer.com](http://www2.emarketer.com/), [www3.emarketer.com](http://www3.emarketer.com/), [www.estats.com](http://www.estats.com/) and <https://secure.e-land.com/bin/estatstore/cart>.   


## Information Gathered

eMarketer gathers information about its users in order to offer useful and easily accessible online content while providing privacy protection. 

  1. **Website Visitors and Newsletter Subscribers:**

eMarketer catalogs traffic patterns throughout the site through non-invasive click-through tracking. eMarketer develops summary -- not individual -- reports for our advertisers. For example, we will report that "12,000 people clicked on advertisement X today and they were in the eStats section of the site." 

  2. **Product Purchasers:**

eMarketer sells information products online. At the time of purchase, we require personal, business and financial information, such as name, e-mail address, shipping/billing address, telephone number and credit card number. This information is necessary to process the order and to send the product to the buyer. If you are a repeat customer, you may be asked to update this information. This information is transmitted in 128 bit encryption and we use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to protect your online order. 

Only our order processing/customer service staff has access to your information. We do not store or access credit card information from our server after your order is processed. eMarketer allows product purchasers to control the storage of their general contact information. If you would like to access, correct or delete any of your contact information that we have on file, please send an e-mail to [general@emarketer.com](mailto:general@emarketer.com).

These updates are sent only to people who have chosen to receive them, and can be opted-out of at any time. Newsletter subscribers can also be opted-out of at any time.

## Contact Information

If eMarketer makes any changes to its privacy policy, those changes will be noted on the eMarketer website. Regardless of later updates or changes to our privacy policy, we will never use the information you submit under our current privacy policy in a new way without first providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prevent that use. 

By participating in the Council of Better Business Bureau's BBB _OnLine_ Privacy Program we have made a commitment to meet the program's strict requirements regarding how we treat your information and have it verified by BBBOnLine. Further information about this program is available at [www.bbbonline.org](http://www.bbbonline.org/).
