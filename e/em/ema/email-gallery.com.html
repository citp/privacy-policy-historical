</p><p>This Privacy Policy outlines the information gathering and dissemination practices for this web site. It represents our privacy commitment to you. It is a work in progress.

</p><p>email-gallery is a direct marketer that delivers targeted messages to its members. email-gallery is about getting permission from its subscribers to send them information on the topics that are relevant to them, not spam. All members of the email-gallery community have requested that they receive information related to specific topics. When working with its merchants, email-gallery reserves the right to review and edit outgoing messages to ensure messages are delivered to members who have requested such information. Users may unsubscribe to electronic mailings sent by us at any time by following the instructions contained at the end of every email-gallery newsletter or mailing.

By registering with email-gallery, you agree to allow us to share such personally identifiable information with advertisers, third party marketers and our affiliates for their direct and online marketing.

Such information may be used by such companies to provide users with information on products and services that may be of interest to them. 

</p><p>If users indicate that they do not want to have their data shared with our marketing partners so that such marketing partners can make users aware of their product offerings, our marketing partners have agreed to limit the use of their data to the suppression, validation and enhancement of existing information held by third parties about its users. If users do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, they have the option to choose not to be contacted or to have their information shared by terminating their email-gallery account at any time.
