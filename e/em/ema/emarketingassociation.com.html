        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Registration</b><br>
          In order to use some areas of this website, a user must first complete 
          the registration form. During registration a user is required to give 
          their contact information (such as name and email address). This information 
          is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which 
          they have expressed interest. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Order</b><br>
          We request information from the user on our secure order form. Here 
          a user must provide contact information (like name and address) and 
          financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This 
          information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer’s orders. 
          If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is 
          used to get in touch with the user.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
          <b>Cookies</b><br>
          A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing 
          information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to 
          any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the 
          user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates.; For instance, 
          by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a 
          password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a 
          user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback 
          to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. 
          Some of our business partners use cookies on our site However, we have 
          no access to or control over these cookies. Log Files We use IP addresses 
          to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement, and gather 
          broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not 
          linked to personally identifiable information.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Sharing</b><br>
          We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and 
          advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can 
          identify any individual person.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>eMail</b><br>
          All email from the eMA contains opt-out instructions, except personal 
          business correspondence, and instructor emails to students which is 
          part of their course. Newsletter subscribers, members, ecourse students, 
          board members, sponsors, event attendees, certified marketers, inquiries 
          and suppliers may from time to time receive email announcements from 
          the eMA. The eMA does not send spam. All email lists maintained by the 
          eMA are opt-in lists or lists of members and students which the eMA 
          has a business relationship with, or those who have made inquiries to 
          the association. The eMA does not rent, sell, or transfer it's lists 
          to any third parties for the purposes of sending unsolicited commercial 
          email. Anyone wishing to be permanently removed from our email lists 
          can make that request to: <a href="mailto:admin@emarketingassociation.com">admin@emarketingassociation.com</a> 
          and your name and email address will be removed within 7 business days.

          the eMA requires its members to abide by all state and federal laws 
          regarding email, and will revoke the membership of members found in 
          violation of those laws or unethical business practices.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We use 
          an outside credit card processing company to bill users for goods and 
          services, as well as an outside service bureau to maintain our lists. 
          These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable 
          information for any secondary purposes. We partner with another party 
          to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, 
          we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary 
          for the third party to provide these services. These parties are not 
          allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose 
          of providing these services. </font></p>

          or business practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to 
          be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements 
          of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. 
          This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this 
          Web site. Please report links that are broken or point to sites engaged

        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Newsletter</b><br>
          If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact 
          information such as name and email address.</font></p>

          about our site, we ask them for the friend’s name and email address. 
          The eMA will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting 
          them to visit the site. eMA stores this information for the sole purpose

        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Security</b><br>
          This website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. 
          When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information 
          is protected both online and off-line. When our registration/order form 
          asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number 
          and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is 
          protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL.While 
          on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom 
          of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer 
          becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 
          ‘surfing’. While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information 
          online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information 
          off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information 
          mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need 
          the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing 
          clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally 
          identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected 
          screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must 
          re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information. Furthermore, 
          ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. 
          Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees 
          are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, 
          and what they can do to ensure our customers’ information is protected. 
          If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can 
          send an email to <a href="mailto:security@emarketingassociation.com">security@emarketingassociation.com</a> 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Special 
          Offers</b><br>
          We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. 
          Established members will occasionally receive information on products, 
          services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy 
          of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. 
          Please see our choice and opt-out below.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
          <b>Site and Service Updates</b><br>
          We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members 
          are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain 
          important information about the service. We communicate with the user 
          to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their 
          account via email or phone.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Correction/Updating 
          Personal Information:</b><br>
          If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as your 
          zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor 
          to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user’s personal data 
          provided to us Choice/Opt-out.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our users 
          are given the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having their information used 
          for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we 
          ask for the information. For example, our order form has an ‘opt-out’ 
          mechanism so users who buy a product from us, but don’t want any marketing 
          material, can keep their email address off of our lists.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Users who 
          no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials from 
          our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying 
          to unsubscribe in the subject line in the email or email us at <a href="mailto:optout@emarketingassociation.com">optout@emarketingassociation.com</a> 
          Users of our site are always notified when their information is being 
          collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an 
          informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that 
          require an outside party, or not. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Notification 
          of Changes</b><br>
          If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes 
          on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we 
          collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose 
          it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information 
          in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, 
          we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as 
          to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. 
          We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under 
          which the information was collected. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Use 
          of Third Party Ads: </b><br>
          Our websites allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or 
          ad networks to display advertisements on our web pages. Some of these 
          ad networks may place a persistent cookie on your computer. Doing this 
          allows the network to know what ads you have seen during your visit 
          and which ads you have clicked on. This is how the program determines 
          what their payments will be for our hosting them on our servers. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We do not 
          have access and cannot control the information shown by these companies. 
          Any clicking and visiting of these programs is up to the viewer and 
          is not the responsibility of the eMarketing Association. <br>
