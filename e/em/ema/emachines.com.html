<font class="disclaimer">Revised as of September 14, 2004</font><br><br>
<font class="pagesubtitle">Privacy Statement</font><br>
<font class="text">Gateway respects our customers' rights to privacy. We hold your detailed customer information in confidence.  This policy applies to information held by Gateway and its affiliated brands, including eMachines, in connection with Gateway's domestic activities.</font>
<br><br>
<font class="pagesubtitle">Asking for your information</font><br>
<font class="text">There are times when we may ask our customers for personal information such as your name, address, e-mail address, occupation, hobbies and other specifics. This information assists us in offering products and services we think you'd like to hear about. If you prefer not to be contacted, please follow the unsubscribe instructions in the e-mail, or contact Gateway at 800-846-2000.
<br><br>
Gateway also collects purchasing information, including credit card numbers and information used to provide requested services, such as order fulfillment. Information collected with our "E-mail this Page to a Friend" Web feature is used one time for that purpose only.
<br><br>
When you choose to give personal information to us over the Internet that we or our business partners may request, we will do our best to inform you how we will use the information. Information collected by using our online financing option is held in confidence by Gateway and our third party vendors. If you accept a financing offer, you are then considered a customer of the vendor, who may market to you consistent with their policies.
<br><br>
When we ask for personal information for any reason, we will provide a link to this policy statement to make our intentions clear.</font>
<br><br>
<font class="pagesubtitle">Personal Information Privacy</font><br>
<font class="text">Gateway will take all appropriate steps to keep your personal information confidential, including limiting access to customer information databases, communicating this policy statement to all Gateway employees and establishing and enforcing penalties for violating this statement. Additionally, Gateway annually certifies itself to the U.S. Department of Commerce Safe Harbor program and ensures its adherence to the Safe Harbor.s standards for privacy protection.

Gateway will not sell, rent or give away customer information to other companies for use in selling others' products or services. When we do contract with another company to market or advertise products or services for us, we will insist on binding agreements from those companies protecting our customer information. We will vigorously enforce all privacy agreements we have with other companies. However, when you receive services directly from a third party, such as a shipping company or internet service provider, your personal information is treated in accordance with that service provider's privacy policy even though you may have purchased the services through Gateway.
<br><br>
We gather personal information from our customers so we can better develop our relationship with those customers. Occasionally, we seek customer comments on our products and services. These comments allow us to determine which products and services our customers should be made aware of based on their specific needs.
<br><br>
We will proactively communicate with customers via e-mail or other online delivery devices to provide offers and information we believe will be of interest. Customers who no longer wish to receive these communications should inform us and we will remove their names from our mailing lists. Gateway will be judicious in the use of e-mail and paper mail to communicate with customer, putting ourselves in the place of the recipients of our mail and treating our customers as we ourselves would like to be treated.
