  <div class="title">Privacy Policy</div>
  <!--Effective October 12, 2003-->
<div id="policyBody">
<div class="policySection">Privacy Statement</div>
<p>
Gateway respects our customers' rights to privacy. 
We hold your detailed customer information in confidence. 
This policy applies to information held by Gateway and its affiliated brands, including eMachines, in connection with Gateway's domestic activities.
</p>
<div class="policySection">Asking for your information</div>
<p>
There are times when we may ask our customers for personal information such as 
your name, address, e-mail address, occupation, hobbies and other specifics. 
This information assists us in offering products and services we think you'd 
like to hear about. If you prefer not to be contacted, please follow the 
unsubscribe instructions in the e-mail, or contact Gateway at 800-846-2000. 
</p>
<p>
Gateway also collects purchasing information, including credit card numbers and 
information used to provide requested services, such as order fulfillment. 
Information collected with our "E-mail this Page to a Friend" Web feature is 
used one time for that purpose only.
</p>
<p>
When we ask for personal information for any reason, we will provide a link to 
this policy statement to make our intentions clear. 
</p>
<div class="policySection">Personal Information Privacy</div>
<p>Gateway will take all appropriate steps to keep your personal information confidential, including limiting access to customer information databases, communicating this policy statement to all Gateway employees and establishing and enforcing penalties for violating this statement. Additionally, Gateway annually certifies itself to the U.S. Department of Commerce Safe Harbor program and ensures its adherence to the Safe Harbor.s standards for privacy protection.
</p>
<p>
Gateway will not sell, rent or give away customer information to other companies for use in selling others' products or services. When we do contract with another company to market or advertise products or services for us, we will insist on binding agreements from those companies protecting our customer information. We will vigorously enforce all privacy agreements we have with other companies. However, when you receive services directly from a third party, such as a shipping company or internet service provider, your personal information is treated in accordance with that service provider's privacy policy even though you may have purchased the services through Gateway.
</p>
<p>
We gather personal information from our customers so we can better develop our relationship with those customers. Occasionally, we seek customer comments on our products and services. These comments allow us to determine which products and services our customers should be made aware of based on their specific needs.
</p>
<p>
We will proactively communicate with customers via e-mail or other online delivery devices to provide offers and information we believe will be of interest. Customers who no longer wish to receive these communications should inform us and we will remove their names from our mailing lists. Gateway will be judicious in the use of e-mail and paper mail to communicate with customer, putting ourselves in the place of the recipients of our mail and treating our customers as we ourselves would like to be treated.
</p>

</p>
<div class="policySection">Order Information Privacy and Credit Card Security</div>
<p>
We currently use the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to safeguard your 
information, including your credit card number, during online transactions. 
None of the tens of thousands of people, who have made purchases through 
Gateway's Website using SSL, have reported to us fraudulent use of their 
credit card as a result of their online order. We believe SSL to be a very 
safe encryption method, but we are always looking for even more secure 
encryption methods to safeguard information sent online. Our server will run 
detection software to help ensure you are using a secure browser and your 
information is secure when you check out. If our browser determines you are 
not using a secure browser, a message will appear at checkout. 
</p>
<p>
For more information on SSL technology, read the Gateway <a href="http://www.gateway.com/about/legal/ssl.shtml" onclick="return policypops('http://www.gateway.com/about/legal/ssl.shtml');">Privacy &amp; Data Security</a> policy page.
</p>
<p>
To protect your information once your transaction is complete, Gateway stores 
your information on an off-line server stored securely behind our firewall. 
There is no external access to this information and its internal access is 
strictly monitored. 
</p>
<p>
For your protection, never put your credit card number or other sensitive 
information in unencrypted e-mail. In the extremely unlikely event that we 
ever do suspect a customer's credit card number has been intercepted, we will 
immediately notify the customer. 
</p>
<div class="policySection">Gateway.com Safe Shopping Guarantee</div>
<p>
Gateway helps ensure your protection by offering a safe shopping guarantee. 
Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your credit card bank cannot hold you 
liable for more than $50 in unauthorized or fraudulent charges. Gateway will 
cover the amount for which you are held liable up to the full $50 if the 
fraudulent transaction resulted through no fault of your own from purchases 
made at Gateway.com using our secure server. Gateway also requires that you 
have followed all rules and procedures of your credit card provider relating 
to fraudulent and authorized use. 
</p>
<div class="policySection">Cookies</div>
<p>
Gateway currently uses "cookies" on our site. Our cookies tag each visitor's 
browser with a random, unique number. The cookie simply assigns a number and 
does not disclose any personal information about the person using the browser. 
By noting where these uniquely numbered browsers go on our site, we can study 
traffic patterns and improve our site. To learn more about cookies, read 
<a href="http://www.gateway.com/about/legal/cookies.shtml" onclick="return policypops('http://www.gateway.com/about/legal/cookies.shtml');">Gateway's Cookie Policy</a>.
