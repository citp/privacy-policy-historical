  * Keeping you signed in
  * Understanding how you use our site
  * Showing you content that is relevant to you
  * Showing you EmailMeForm products and services that are relevant to you
  * Working with partners to serve you relevant advertising



Ultimately, this allows us to publish the content that you read on our sites and apps.

In the next section, we explain in more detail how we use cookies and similar technology on our sites and apps for a number of purposes.

Other organizations also collect user information on our sites through cookies, tags and pixels. Tags and pixels, also known as web beacons, are similar to cookies but are collected through embedded images.

Using cookies and other technology allows other organizations to help us to analyze how our site is being used, measure the number of visitors to the site, and display advertising.

Cookies that are used by EmailMeForm are referred to as "first-party cookies" and those that are used by our partners are "third-party cookies". Because of how cookies work, our website cannot access third-party cookies; nor can other organizations access the data in the cookies we use on our website. There are more details about both in the following sections.

### 6.3 What types of cookies do we use?

We use four types of cookies, which we describe in this section.

  * **Essential** – cookies that are essential to provide you with services you have requested. For example, these include the cookies that make it possible for you to stay logged into your EmailMeForm account and make comments. If you set your browser to block these cookies, then these functions and services will not work for you. In particular, we won’t be able to save your preferences about cookies.

  * **Performance** \- cookies which measure how often you visit our sites and how you use them. We use this information to get a better sense of how our users engage with our content and to improve our sites and apps, so that users have a better experience. For example, we collect information about which of our pages are most frequently visited, and by which types of users. We also use third-party cookies to help with performance. For example, the Google Analytics cookie gives us information such as your journey between pages and whether you have downloaded anything (details of how to opt out of it are below).

  * **Functionality** – cookies that are used to recognize you and remember your preferences or settings when you return to our site, so that we can provide you with a more personalized experience. For example, if you are based in the United Kingdom, we will remember this and make sure that you receive the UK homepage when you visit our site, rather than the US or Australia homepage. A mix of first-party and third-party cookies are used.

  * **Advertising** – cookies that are used to collect information about your visit to our site, the content you have viewed, the links you have followed and information about your browser, device and your IP address. We have set out more details on this below.

If you are located outside the EU and choose to use the Service or provide your information to us, please note that your information may be transferred, processed and stored by our service providers in other non-EU countries. Privacy laws of the European Union and third countries may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. Your agreement to the terms of this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of information in connection with the Service represents your agreement to this practice. If you do not want your information transferred to or processed or stored in the EU or in the United States, you should not use the Service. If you are located in the EU, we guarantee that we will only transfer your data to companies that have signed our Data Privacy Agreement or that are registered with the Privacy Shield, to ensure a level of data protection compliant with the GDPR.

Your data is not disclosed to any third party except (i) for providing the services you requested and for which EmailMeForm collaborates with third parties, (ii) when we have your permission, (iii) when it is required by a competent authority in the exercise of its duties (for example in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities) or (iv) as otherwise required by law.

We do not use your data other than as described in this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use.

## 13\. Canceling Your Account and Modifying Personal Information

**13.1** You may cancel your account at any time by changing the settings in your account settings page. Deleting your account will cause all the data in your EmailMeform account to be permanently deleted from our systems within a reasonable time period, as permitted by law and will disable your access to any other services that require an EmailMeForm account. We will respond to any such request, and any appropriate request to access, correct, update or delete your personal information within the time period specified by law (if applicable) or without excessive delay. We will promptly fulfill requests to delete personal data unless the request is not technically feasible or such data is required to be retained by law (in which case we will block access to such data, if required by law).

**13.2** You may modify your personal information by logging in and visiting your [Account settings page](https://app.emailmeform.com/builder/account), following the instructions provided, or open a support ticket.

**14.2** The information we retain about you will be handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy during the maximum terms permitted by law, and will exclusively be used for the purposes described in section 14.1 above.

If you are a Respondent, you will need to ask the Creator how long your responses will be stored in EmailMeForm services.

**14.4** EmailMeForm is committed to maintaining your privacy and security. We respect the privacy of all of our account holders and the data collected from the forms. Although EmailMeForm may own the data storage, databases and the service, you retain all rights to your data. We will also not utilize your data in our databases to compete with you, market to your clients, advertise to, or contact them for any reason. The only exception to our strict adherence to your privacy is if it becomes necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of the Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law.

## 15\. EU-U.S. Privacy Shield

**15.1** EmailMeForm is located in the United States and accordingly, data (to include Respondent data) will be transferred to the United States.

EmailMeForm participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. EmailMeForm is committed to subjecting all personal information and data received from European Union (EU) member countries, in reliance on the Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework’s applicable Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List. https://www.privacyshield.gov/.

EmailMeForm also complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU, including the onward transfer liability provisions.

When EmailMeForm receives personal information under the Privacy Shield and then transfers it to a third-party service provider acting as agent on EmailMeForm’s behalf, EmailMeForm has certain liability under the Privacy Shield if both (i) the agent processes the information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield and (ii) EmailMeForm is responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, EmailMeForm is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, EmailMeForm may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
