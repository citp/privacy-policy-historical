**Collection and Use of Information**

**Parental Consent for Students' Use of the Website**

EMC will presume/require that the applicable school or school district has obtained the consent of the parent or legal guardian of all Students ("students") using the Website. By arranging with EMC for Students to access and use the Website, (i) students and their parents and legal guardians, schools and school districts are consenting to the provisions of this Privacy Policy, including the use of Personal Information and Performance Data by EMC in the manner described above; and (ii) schools and school districts are accepting responsibility for obtaining any and all necessary parental consents for EMC to collect and use the Personal Information and Performance Data in the ways described in this policy.

COPPA is a regulation that requires parental consent for the online collection of information about users under 13. Any school administering the Website acknowledges and agrees that it is solely responsible for compliance with COPPA, including, but not limited to, obtaining parental consent concerning collection of students' personal information used in connection with the provisioning and use of the Services by the Customer and End Users.

For parents and legal guardians of K12 students: If you have any questions concerning use of the Website, and/or with respect to the collection and use of information or materials uploaded to this site, please contact an authorized representative at the School District.

**Registration and User Profiles**

In connection with the registration process, each School District User will provide user profile information as instructed by the School District. User profile information may include a user ID and an email address.

When a School District User registers with the School District to use the Website, he or she will also be asked to create a password. This password should not be disclosed to anyone. If a School District User shares his or her password or other Personal Information or Performance Data with others, the School District User shall be responsible for all resulting actions, including actions taken in the name of the School District User's account. Therefore, if a School District User's password has been compromised for any reason, the School District User's (and in the case of students, such student's parent and/or legal guardian) should immediately notify an authorized representative at the School District.

**Collection of Personal Information**

Once a School District User is registered to use the Website, a user ID will be created for the School District User and Personal Information will be collected for such User, *[[including name and email address]]*. You do not have an option to hide your user ID from others. All use of user IDs must conform to any requirements set out in the Website's [Terms and Conditions of Use](https://www.emcp.com/terms-of-use). Personal Information may also be provided when a School District User uploads certain materials to the Website, such as videos of the School District User.

**Use of Cookies and Plug-ins**

The Website uses a web browser feature called a "cookie". A cookie is a small data file that certain websites write to a user's hard drive when the user visits the site. A cookie can't read data off a user's hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. A user may disable or adjust a browser's acceptance of cookies by looking within the settings and/or preferences within that user's web browser. Please note that if a user disables cookies, the user may not be able to take advantage of certain aspects of a website's interactive features. The Website also uses plug-ins. A plug-in is a piece of software that the user downloads into the user's web browser that allows certain web-based software to operate. In order to interact on the Website, School District Users must install certain plug-ins.

Cookies are used on the Website to recognize visitors when they are on the site. Cookies enable the School District Users' online visits to be customized. For instance, cookies can be used to track and target our users' activities, and alert users to new features. We may also evaluate our content and services and tailor our School District Users' experiences based on other information we collect such as IP addresses, pixel tags, and the type of Internet browser or operating system you are using. The information so collected may be tied to a specific School District User through the cookie used as described above; however, no one at EMC will be able to determine that it is tied to a personally identified School District User for any purpose and such information will not be tied to any personally identifiable information except as needed to diagnose and/or remedy a problem with the online service.

This information is used to gather demographic information on visitors to the Website (such as geographic locations users are visiting from and the time spent on the site), help diagnose problems with the server, administer and improve the Website and analyze usage trends. As part of this use of information, we may provide this aggregate information to the schools and school districts, and may also provide aggregate information to our Affiliates and partners about how school districts (and their students), use the Website.
