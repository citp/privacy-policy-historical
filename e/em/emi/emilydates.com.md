# Privacy policy - EmilyDates

Welcome to [Emilydates.com](https://emilydates.com/) (the "Service"), operated by Internet Website Limited ("Emilydates" or "we"). When you use the Service, we process your Personal Data and other information. "Personal Data" refers to any data that allows us (regardless of whether we do this or not) to identify you (the "User") as a natural person. 

Your privacy is important to us and we have prepared this Privacy Policy to explain to you:

  * What information we collect and why.
  * How we use and share that information.
  * How you can access and update that information.

By providing Sensitive Data to us, you give consent to the collection, use and disclosure thereof as permitted by applicable privacy laws. We may also collect your geolocation information with your consent. By using the Service, you authorize us to gather, parse and retain data related to the provision of the Service.

Please note that we may store the first six and the last four digits of your credit card number as envisaged by the Payment Card Industry Security Data Standard ("PCI DSS") to help us identify any possible credit card fraud or other illegal behaviour.

The Service may contain links to websites operated and maintained by third parties over which we have no control. Privacy policies on such linked websites may be different from our Privacy Policy. You access such linked websites at your own risk. Similarly, the Service may be accessed and used from third-party websites that we do not control. We have no control over the privacy policies of such third-party websites and therefore you access such third-party websites at your own risk.

If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child, we will dispose of that information in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your child has provided us with personal information, please email us immediately.

## Consent to transfer

To provide our products and services to you, we may send and store your Personal Data outside of the country where you reside or are located. Accordingly, if you reside or are located outside of the United States, your personal information may be transferred outside of the country where you reside or are located, including to countries that may not or do not provide the same level of protection for your personal information. We are committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of personal information when it is transferred.

## Data retention

We keep your information only for as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes and as permitted by applicable legal requirements. If you close your account, we will retain certain data for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, enforce our Terms of Use, take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity of our Service or our users, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law. In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, retention of that information will be subject to the policies of those third parties. 

## Security measures

We take security measures to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, chats, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the law, our data collection and use practices, the features of our Service, or advances in technology. We recommend that you check our Service from time to time to inform yourself of any changes in this Privacy Policy or any of our other policies. Your continued use of the Services following the posting of changes to this policy will mean you consent to and accept those changes.
