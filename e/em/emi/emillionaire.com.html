          Your privacy is very important to us. We want to make your experience 
          on the Internet as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we want 
          you to use the Internet's vast array of information, tools, and opportunities 
          with complete confidence.<br>
          <br>
          We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment 
          to privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes how our company 
          collects information from all end users of our Internet services (the 
          "Services")-those who access some of our Services but do not 
          have accounts ("Visitors") as well as those who may purchase 
          Products and/or pay a monthly service fee to subscribe to the Service 
          ("Members")-what we do with the information we collect, and 
          the choices Visitors and Members have concerning the collection and 
          use of such information. We request that you read this Privacy Policy 
          carefully.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Personal Information Our Company Collects and How It Is Used</strong><br>
          <br>
          Introduction. Our company collects information in different ways from 
          Visitors and Members who access the various parts of our Services and 
          the network of Web sites accessible through our Service. We use this 
          information primarily to provide a customized experience as you use 
          our Products and Services, and generally, do not share this information 
          with third parties. However, we may disclose personal information collected 
          if we have received your permission beforehand or in very special circumstances, 
          such as when we believe that such disclosure is required by law or other 
          special cases described below.<br>
          <br>
          Registration: Members may be asked to provide certain personal information 
          when they sign up for our Products or Services including name, address, 
          telephone number, billing information (such as a credit card number), 
          and the type of personal computer being used to access the Services. 
          The personal information collected from Members during the registration 
          process is used to manage each Member's account (such as for billing 
          purposes). This information is not shared with third parties, unless 
          specifically stated otherwise or in special circumstances.<br>
          <br>
          However, in instances where our company and a partner jointly promote 
          our Services, we may provide the partner certain personal information, 
          such as the name, address, and username of persons who subscribed to 
          the Services as a result of the joint promotion for the sole purpose 
          of allowing us and the partner to assess the results of the promotion. 
          <br>
          <br>
          In this instance, personal information may not be used by the partner 
          for any other purpose. We may also generate non-identifying and aggregate 
          profiles from personal information Members provide during registration 
          (such as the total number, but not the names, of Members). As explained 
          in more detail below, we may use this aggregated and non-identifying 
          information to sell advertisements that appear on the Services.<br>
          <br>
          Our Company Partners and Sponsors: Some products and services may be 
          offered to Visitors and Members in conjunction with an affiliate, independent 
          contractor seller or non-affiliated partner. To provide Visitors and 
          Members some of these products and services, the partner may need to 
          collect and maintain personal information. In these instances, you will 
          be notified before any such data is collected or transferred and may 
          decide not to use that particular service or feature. <br>
          <br>
          Additionally, our partners may have advertisements or co-branded Web 
          Pages that are cosponsored by an affiliate, independent contractor seller, 
          or non-affiliated partner. Our company may share non-identifying and 
          aggregate information (except as described above), but not personal 
          information, with such partners in order to administer the co-branded 
          products or services offered. <br>
          <br>
          Online Shopping: At some Web sites, you can purchase products and services 
          or register to receive materials, such as a newsletter, catalog or new 
          product and service updates. In many cases, you may be asked to provide 
          contact information, such as your name, address, email address, phone 
          number, and credit/debit card information. <br>
          If you complete an order for someone else, such as an online gift order 
          sent directly to a recipient, you may be asked to provide information 
          about the recipient, such as the recipient's name, address, and phone 
          number. Our company has no control over the third parties' use of any 
          personal information you provide when placing such an order. Please 
          exercise care when doing so. <br>
          <br>
          If you order services or products directly from our company we will 
          use the personal information you provide only to process that order. 
          We do not share this information with outside parties except to the 
          extent necessary to complete that order. <br>
          Online Advertisements: Our company may display our online advertisements. 
          In those cases we share aggregated and non-identifying information about 
          our Visitors and Members collected through the registration process 
          as well as through online surveys and promotions with these advertisers. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Additionally, in some instances, we use this aggregated and non-identifying 
          information to deliver tailored advertisements or joint ventures. For 
          instance, an advertiser or joint venture company tells us the audience 
          they want to reach and provides us an advertisement tailored to the 
          audience. Based upon the aggregated and non-identifying information 
          we have collected, we may then display or send the advertisement to 
          the intended audience. Our company does not share personal information 
          about its Visitors or Members with these advertisers or joint venture 
          companies.<br>
          <br>
          Responses to Email Inquiries: When Visitors or Members send email inquiries 
          to our company, the return email address is used to answer the email 
          inquiry we receive. Our company does not use the return email address 
          for any other purpose and does not share the return email address with 
          any third party. <br>
          <br>
          Voluntary Customer Surveys: We may periodically conduct both business 
          and individual customer surveys. We encourage our customers to participate 
          in these surveys because they provide us with important information 
          that helps us to improve the types of products and services we offer 
          and how we provide them to you. Your personal information and responses 
          will remain strictly confidential, even if the survey is conducted by 
          a third party. Participation in our customer surveys is voluntary.<br>
          <br>
          We may take the information we receive from individuals responding to 
          our Customer Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses 
          of other customers we may have, to create broader, generic responses 
          to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, 
          employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). We then 
          use the aggregated information to improve the quality of our services 
          to you, and to develop new services and products. This aggregated, non-personally 
          identifying information may be shared with third parties.<br>
          <br>
          Special Cases: It is our company's policy not to use or share the personal 
          information about Visitors of Members in ways unrelated to the ones 
          described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt out 
          or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.<br>
          <br>
          However, we may disclose personal information about Visitors or Members, 
          or information regarding your use of the Services or Web sites accessible 
          through our Services, for any reason if, in our sole discretion, we 
          believe that it is reasonable to do so, including: credit agencies, 
          collection agencies, merchant database agencies, law enforcement, or 
          to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 
          the Child Online Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental or legal 
          requests for such information; to disclose information that is necessary 
          to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may 
          be violating our Acceptable Use Policy or Terms Of Service, or other 
          user policies; to operate the Services properly; or to protect our company 
          and our Members. <br>
          <br>
          "Cookies" and How Our Company Uses Them. A "cookie" 
          is a small data file that can be placed on your hard drive when you 
          visit certain Web sites. Our company may use cookies to collect, store, 
          and sometimes track information for statistical purposes to improve 
          the products and services we provide and to manage our telecommunications 
          networks. <br>
          <br>
          If you are a Visitor or Member we may use a cookie to save your settings 
          and to provide customizable and personalized services. These cookies 
          do not enable third parties to access any of your customer information. 
          Additionally, be aware that if you visit other Web sites where you are 
          prompted to log in or that are customizable, you may be required to 
          accept cookies. <br>
          <br>
          Advertisers and partners may also use their own cookies. We do not control 
          use of these cookies and expressly disclaim responsibility for information 
          collected through them. <br>
          <br>
          Our Company Commitment to Children's Privacy. Protecting children's 
          privacy is especially important to us. It is our policy to comply with 
          the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and all other applicable 
          laws. Therefore we restrict our Web site to persons eighteen years or
