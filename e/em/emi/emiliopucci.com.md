    * Provision of services offered on the Website;

The provision of your personal data for these activities is a contractual obligation.

The processing of voluntarily sent CVs, carried out to evaluate candidates with respect to a possible job position at Emilio Pucci Srl, is legitimate because it is expressly authorised by a law, which specifies that in this case the consent of the person to whom the personal data refers is not required. You are free to send us your CV or not, but without it we will not be able to evaluate your candidacy for a job position at Emilio Pucci Srl.
  3. For our legitimate interest.  
If you purchase products on the Website by credit or debit card, some of your personal data may be processed to carry out anti-fraud activities: we have a legitimate interest in carrying out this activity to prevent and pursue any fraudulent activity.
