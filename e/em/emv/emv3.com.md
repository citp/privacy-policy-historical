In these cases, personal data collected from End Users is owned by the applicable Client, and Emailvision processes this data on the Client's behalf.

Such data may include, name, billing address, business address, email address, telephone number, , and other information, depending on the particular Client, Web site or other application or service at issue.

Emailvision will not review, share, distribute, or reference any such Customer Data except as provided in the Emailvision Master Subscription Agreement, or as may be required by law.

**10\. Children’s Protection**   
We do not collect, use, or disclose information from children under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personal information without their consent, he or she should contact us at **[privacy@Emailvision.com](mailto:privacy@Emailvision.com)**.

**11\. Security**  
Emailvision uses robust security measures to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and help ensure the appropriate use of Customer Data. When the Service is accessed using Internet Explorer version 6.0 or later, Firefox version 2.0 or later, or Safari version 3.0 or later, Secure Socket Layer (“SSL”) technology protects Customer Data using both server authentication and data encryption. These technologies help ensure that Customer Data is safe, secure, and only available to the Customer to whom the information belongs and those to whom the Customer has granted access. Emailvision also implements an advanced security method based on dynamic data and encoded session identifications, and the Company hosts its Web sites in a secure server environment that uses firewalls and other advanced technology to prevent interference or access from outside intruders. Emailvision also offers enhanced security features within the Service that permit Customers to configure security settings to the level they deem necessary. Because the Company uses the Service to maintain Data About Emailvision Customers, this information is secured in the same manner as described above for Customer Data.

The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
