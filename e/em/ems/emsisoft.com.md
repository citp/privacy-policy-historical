If it ever comes to a legislative or court decision that forces us to do this then we will immediately notify our users of this fact. Especially the behavior analysis module of Emsisoft Anti-Malware does not distinguish between "benign" and "malignant" pests. As a user, you always have the possibility of immediately blocking a suspicious program.
