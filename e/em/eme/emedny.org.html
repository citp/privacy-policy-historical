<h2>Information Collected When You E-mail this Website or Complete a Transaction</h2>
<p>During your visit to this website you may send an e-mail to the New York State Department of Health. Your e-mail address and the contents of your message will be collected.

<p>During your visit to this website you may complete a transaction such as a survey, registration, or order form. The information, including <em>personal information</em>, volunteered by you in completing the transaction is used by the New York State Department of Health to operate New York State Department of Health programs, which include the provision of goods, services, and information. The information collected by the New York State Department of Health may also be disclosed by the New York State Department of Health for those purposes that may be reasonably ascertained from the nature and terms of the transaction in which the information was submitted.</p>
<p>The New York State Department of Health does not knowingly collect <em>personal information</em> from children or create profiles of children through this website. <em>Users</em> are cautioned, however, that the collection of <em>personal information</em> submitted in an e-mail will be treated as though it was submitted by an adult, and may, unless exempted from access by federal or State law, be subject to public access.

<p>However, the New York State Department of Health may collect or disclose <em>personal information</em> without consent if the collection or disclosure is: (1) necessary to perform the statutory duties of the New York State Department of Health, or necessary for the New York State Department of Health to operate a program authorized by law, or authorized by state or federal statute or regulation; (2) made pursuant to a court order or by law; (3) for the purpose of validating the identity of the <em>user</em>; or (4) of information to be used solely for statistical purposes that is in a form that cannot be used to identify any particular person.</p>
