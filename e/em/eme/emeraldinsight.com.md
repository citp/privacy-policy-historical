  1. ### Definitions

In this Licence, the following terms shall have the meanings set out below:

“You” means either an individual subscriber or a student, faculty member, alumnus or employee of an institution, corporate or government subscriber, or a non-subscriber accessing free content.

“Publisher’s Content” means the whole or any part of a copyright-protected literary work, of a database or of any other information product owned or controlled by the Publisher or its suppliers, and includes (without limitation) any illustration, table, figure, header information, abstracts, bibliographic information or any video or computer-animated design embedded or incorporated in such literary work, database or information product. For avoidance of doubt, Publishers’ Content includes manuscripts of books, published journal articles, abstracts and bibliographic information contained in the institutional or subject repositories, where the Publisher has not expressly agreed to the text and data mining of any such content.

“Text and Data Mining” or “TDM” means to perform extensive automated searches of Publisher’s Content, the sorting, parsing, addition or removal of linguistic structures, and the selection and inclusion of content into an index or database for purposes of classification or recognition of relations and associations.

“Text and Data Mining Output” or “TDM Output” means the result of any Text and Data Mining activity or operation, capable of fixation, reproduction and/or communication in any form, such as the creation of an index, reference, abstract, relative or absolute description or representation of Publisher’s Content, an algorithm, formula, metrics, method, standard or taxonomy describing or based on Publisher’s Content, a relational expression or measurement, whether scalable or not, of Publisher’s Content, extraction, alternative representation or translation, expression or discussion of any extracts from mined Publisher’s Content, whether in the form of a direct extraction or a representation in any form which is based on Publisher’s Content.

  2. ### Description and term of text and data mining activities

    1. Upon the terms of this Licence, the Publisher grants you the non-exclusive, non-transferable right to TDM the Publisher’s Content. For the avoidance of doubt, TDM rights are granted here purely for internal non-commercial research purposes.
    2. You may access and use the Publisher’s Content for TDM for so long as you contemporaneously maintain a subscription to such Publisher’s Content (unless you are a non-subscriber accessing only free content).
    3. You acknowledge that all right, title and interest in and to the Publisher’s Content remains with the Publisher and that unauthorized use and/or redistribution of the Publisher’s Content or the TDM Output could materially harm the Publisher.
    4. You may load and technically format the XML version of the Publisher’s Content on your server, PC or laptop to enable access to and use of such Publisher’s Content for TDM purposes by using automated programs or devices to continuously and automatically: (i) download, extract and index information from the Publisher’s Content for the purpose of enhanced navigation of the emeraldinsight.com website to which you separately subscribe; (ii) extract semantic entities from the Publisher’s Content for the purpose of recognition and classification of the relations between them and mount, load and integrate the results on a server used for your text-mining system (i.e. not in libraries, repositories or archives); (iii) derive patterns within the Publisher’s Content; and (iv) evaluate and interpret the TDM Output for access and use by you.
    5. Publisher excludes any warranty regarding the quality of the data, formatting and errors or omissions. The Publisher’s Content is made available “as is” and without warranty of fitness for purpose, satisfactory quality, reliability or completeness and the Publisher disclaims any implied quality in relation to it.
    6. Except as expressly stated in this Licence or otherwise permitted in writing by Publisher, you may not: 
      1. perform systematic or substantive extracting, especially when performed for the purposes to create a product or service for use by third parties;
      2. utilise the TDM Output to enhance institutional or subject repositories in a way that would compete with the value of the final peer-review journal articles, or have the potential to substitute and/or replicate any other existing Publisher product, service and/or solution;
      3. make the results of any TDM Output available on an externally facing server or website;
      4. allow a third party to harvest any TDM Output to an internal server;
      5. extract, develop or use the Publisher’s Content in any commercial activity;
      6. abridge, modify, translate or create any derivative work based on the Publisher’s Content, except to the extent necessary to make it perceptible on a computer screen;
      7. remove, obscure or modify in any way any copyright notices, other notices or disclaimers as they appear in the Publisher’s Content; and/or
      8. substantially or systematically reproduce, retain or redistribute the Publisher’s Content.
  3. ### Breach

    1. In addition to any contractual rights and remedies under the applicable law, the Publisher shall retain the right to deny access to any Publisher-hosted content where you are in breach of any of the conditions of this Licence. Where you have made available any of the Publisher’s Content or any resulting TDM Output available to third parties, Publisher shall be entitled to terminate this Licence and also to charge you any subscription fee that would have been payable to the Publisher, had the use in question been agreed. For avoidance of doubt, the foregoing contractual remedies apply in addition to and not in substitution of any rights and remedies for breach available in law, such as the right to claim damages and disgorging of any profits generated by reason of any TDM Output in contravention of this Licence.
  4. ### Deletion of locally loaded publisher's content

    1. Upon termination or expiry of this Licence, howsoever arising, you shall destroy any copies of Publisher’s Content where this has been locally loaded for purposes of TDM. Where requested by the Publisher, you may be asked to provide a signed certificate of destruction no later than 30 days after termination or expiry.
    2. For the avoidance of doubt, Clause 2.6 of this of this Licence shall remain effective and survive termination of this Licence.



### Emerald text and data mining policy

Emerald believes that a right to read is a right to mine, and supports researchers’ rights to be able to text and data mine content that they have legal access to. 

Authorised users at subscribing institutions have our permission to mine journal content they have legal access to for non-commercial purposes, subject to the terms of our subscription agreements. The outputs of any TDM activities should bear the appropriate attribution of the original Emerald content where possible. 

To allow Emerald to manage server capacity, we would ask that you notify us before conducting any TDM activities on [www.emerald.com/insight](https://www.emerald.com/insight). This will allow us to enable you to complete your activity without technical obstacles and to maintain access for all Emerald users. 

If you have any questions about this policy, or wish to notify us of your planned TDM activity, please contact us at [permissions@emeraldinsight.com](mailto:permissions@emeraldinsight.com)
