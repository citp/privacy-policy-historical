_"We contacted Emergency reporting to explore their internet based reporting system. After just a few weeks of trial reporting and working with representatives from MBI and Emergency Reporting, we were convinced our department was entering into an agreement with two highly trained and professional corporations focused on customer service. The continued support from MBI and Emergency Reporting made this critical change in our operations a pleasurable experience for our department."_
