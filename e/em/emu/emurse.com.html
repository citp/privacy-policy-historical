		computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We link the information
		we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while
		on our site. This helps provide a similar user experience from one session to
		the next. </p>
		
		
		<p>We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.  We
		use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session
		ID cookie expires when you close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on
		your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent
		cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browsers help file</p>

		dont have to enter it more than once.  Persistent cookies also enable us to
		track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our
		site.  </p>
		
		
		<p>If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your
		ability to use some areas of our site, such as contests or surveys, will be
		limited. </p>

		<h3>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</h3>
		
		<p>We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a users computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers personally identifiable information. </p>
		
		<p>We use clear gifs in our
		HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. 
		This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the
		effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.  If you would like to opt-out of
		these emails, please see Choice and Opt-out. </p>
		
		<h3>Third Party Advertisers</h3>
		
		<p>The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to users by our advertising partners.   We share Web site
		usage information about users with a reputable third party for the purpose of
		targeting our Internet banner advertisements on this site. </p>
		
		<p>These advertising partners may
		use cookies and clear GIFs on this site, which allow it to recognize a user's
		cookie when a user visits this site. The information that is collected and shared
		through this technology is not personally identifiable.  </p>

		owned or controlled by postGorilla, Inc. Please be aware that we, postGorilla,
		Inc., are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.  </p>
		
		
		<p>We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to

		identifiable information.  </p>
		
		<p>This privacy statement applies only to information collected
		by this Web site. </p>

		<p>If your personally identifiable information changes, or if
		you no longer desire our service, you may deactivate it by emailing our
		Customer Support at postGorilla, Inc. or by contacting us by telephone or
		postal mail at the contact information listed below.</p>
		
		<h3>Security</h3>
		
		<p>The security of your
		personal information is important to us.  When you enter sensitive information
		(such as credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration
		or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer
		technology (SSL). </p>
		
		
		
		<p>We follow generally
		accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to
		us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission
		over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. 
		Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your
		personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

		be notified via prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days of any such change
		in ownership or control of your personal information.</p>

		post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we
		deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we
