When you request access, we may need to take measures to verify your identity.  An access request may be subject to a reasonable fee to meet our costs in providing you with the information that we hold about you. We can inform you of the current costs when you contact us about obtaining access.

If you think that any personal information we hold about you is inaccurate and would like to request that we correct it, please contact our Privacy Officer using the details set out in section 10 of this Privacy Policy and we will take reasonable steps to ensure that it is corrected. If appropriate, we will send the amended information to third parties to whom the information has been disclosed.
