Our Website also uses various technologies, including cookies and web beacons, to collect information from Website users.  Cookies are small pieces of electronic information stored on your hard drive. They help us to learn which portions of our Website are most useful to you. This data is collected completely anonymously and does not identify you personally.  Web beacons notify us of your visit to particular web pages and are used in combination with cookies.

You may delete or disable cookies or prevent your device from receiving cookies by amending your browser settings.  You will need to go into your web browser’s settings/preference and do this from there. Each browser has different settings to manage these and you may need to read through your browser’s Help section.   However, if you do so, this will affect your browsing experience with us, especially when trying to add products to your basket for checkout.   

For detailed information on the cookies we use and the purposes for which we used them see our Cookies Policy [here](http://www.emuaustralia.com/us/cookies-policy.html).

We do not use our Website to knowingly solicit information from or market to minors under the age of 18.  If you are under the age of 18, permission from your parent or guardian will be required to use our Website or online services.

You may encounter cookies or pixel tags on websites that we do not control. For example, if you view a web page created by a third party or use an application developed by a third party, there may be a cookie or pixel tag placed by the web page or application. Likewise, these third parties may place cookies or pixel tags that are not subject to our control and our Privacy Policy does not cover their use.

Third parties that link on this site may use cookies or collect other information when you go to their site. We do not control the collection or use of your information by these organizations. You should contact these organizations directly if you have any questions about their collection or use of information about you.

## **4.     ** **Keeping your information secure**

We want you to have continuing trust in us and in our products and services and, so, we have put in place reasonable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure your personal information.

We use a Verisign Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to encrypt all sensitive data transferred to and from your computer when making an online transaction via our Website. This enables you to have the most secure shopping experience possible and aims to ensure that your private data is not captured by anyone else other than the bank of your choice. We do not keep a copy of any credit card details used when making a purchase. 

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through our Website cannot be guaranteed; and (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party.

To process your payments, we may share some of your personal information with the service providers that process that payment.  We have requested that such service providers not use your information to market their services to you unless you have agreed to it. If an attempted payment fails, or is later invalidated, we may also provide the service provider or any payment service providers with details of the unsuccessful payment.

We work with third parties, including financial institutions, to enable them to accept or facilitate payments from you using our website. In doing so, a third party may share information about you with us.  Please note that payment service providers have their own privacy policies, and we may not be held responsible for their operations, including, but not limited to, their information practices.  All such third parties are independently responsible to monitor and disclose to you their privacy policies.

Other than as described herein, we will not disclose your credit card number or bank account number to anyone, except with your express permission or if we are required to do so to comply with a credit card rules, subpoena or other legal process.

By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

We protect your personal information by maintaining physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in compliance with applicable United States federal and state regulations. We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and employing the latest version of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Technology to encrypt all sensitive information providing you with the safest, most secure shopping experience possible with data encryption.  We enforce physical access controls to our buildings and files, and we authorize access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfil their job responsibilities.  

Throughout this policy, we use the term "personal information" to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal information to include information that has been rendered anonymous so that it does not identify a specific user.
