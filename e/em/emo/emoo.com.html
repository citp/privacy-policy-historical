Welcome to www.eMoo.bm ("eMoo"). Thanks for stopping by. These Terms of Use, the Privacy Policy, the Mobile Devices Terms and all policies posted on our site set out the terms on which we offer you access to and use of our site, services, applications and tools (collectively "Services").

<b>Your Account.</b> In order to access and use some or a portion of the Services, you may be required to register with us and set up an account with your email address and a password (your "Account"). The email address you provide will be your email address, and you are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password. You are solely responsible for all activities that occur under your Account. Therefore, you should protect your password and make your password difficult for others to guess.You may connect to the Services with a third-party service and you give us permission to access, store, and use your information from that service as permitted by that service and as may be described in our Privacy Policy. If you believe your Account may have been compromised or misused, contact us immediately at eMoo Customer Support.</p><p>

<b>Abusing eMoo Services.</b> Please use the flagging system to tell us about any problems or offensive content so that together we can keep the Services site working properly. We may limit or terminate our Services, remove hosted content and take technical and legal steps to keep users off eMoo if we think that they are creating problems or acting inconsistently with the letter or spirit of our policies. However, whether we decide to take any of these steps, remove hosted content or keep a user off eMoo or not, we do not accept any liability for monitoring eMoo or for unauthorized or unlawful content on eMoo or use of eMoo by users.</p><p>
<b>Global Marketplace.</b> Some of eMoo's features may display your ad on other sites that are part of the global Bermuda Press Holdings Limited (hereinafter referred to as the 'BPHL') community, like on The Royal Gazette or our classifieds sites in other countries. By using eMoo Services, you agree that your ads can be displayed on these other sites. The terms for our other sites are similar to these terms, but you may be subject to additional laws or other restrictions in the countries where your ad is posted. When you choose to post your ad to another site, you may be responsible for ensuring that it does not violate our other site policies.

We may choose to temporarily change our fees for promotional events or new services; these changes are effective when we announce the promotional event or new service. Our fees are non-refundable, and you are responsible for paying them when they're due. If you don't, we may limit your ability to use the Services. If your payment method fails or your account is past due, we may collect fees owed using other collection mechanisms. </p><p>
<b>Content.</b> eMoo Services contains stuff from us, you, and other users. You agree not to copy, modify, or distribute eMoo Services, our copyrights or trademarks. When you give us content, you are granting us a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, sub-licensable right to exercise the copyright, publicity, and database rights to that content. If you believe that your rights have been violated, please notify eMoo Customer Support and we will investigate the matter. We reserve the right to remove content where we have grounds for suspecting the violation of these terms or the rights of any other party.</p><p>
<b>Reporting Intellectual Property Infringements.</b> Do not post content that infringes the rights of third parties. This includes, but is not limited to, content that infringes on intellectual property rights such as copyrights and trademarks (e.g. offering counterfeit items for sale). We reserve the right to remove content where we have grounds for suspecting the violation of these terms, our policies or of any party's rights. The following steps are for reporting a listing to eMoo that you believe to be infringing on your intellectual property rights. Only the intellectual property rights owner can report of potentially infringing items or listings by contacting eMoo's directly. If you have a good faith belief that a listing on any of the eMoo Services infringes your copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights, please contact eMoo.</p><p>
<b>Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability.</b> The eMoo Services are provided "as is" and "as available". You agree not to hold us responsible for things other users post or do. You also agree not to hold us responsible for the payment processing of other service providers such as PayPal (each a "Third Party Payment Processor".  For greater certainty, as applicable, if you link a Third-Party Payment Processor account to your eMoo Account, you acknowledge and agree that by making payments through eMoo with that Third Party Payment Processor, you are bound by that Third Party Payment Processor's applicable terms and conditions, and we are not liable for any loss, claims or damages howsoever arising in connection with that third party's services). As most of the stuff on the eMoo Services comes from other users, we do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, efficacy or timeliness of any postings or user communications or the quality, safety, or legality of what is offered. We also cannot guarantee continuous or secure access to our Services. Notification functionality in our Services may not occur in real time. Such functionality is subject to delays beyond our control, including without limitation, delays or latency due to your physical location or your wireless data service provider's network. Accordingly, to the extent legally permitted we expressly disclaim all warranties, representations and conditions, express or implied, including those of quality, merchantability, merchantable quality, durability, fitness for a particular purpose and those arising by statute. We are not liable for any loss, whether of money (including profit), goodwill, or reputation, or any special, indirect, or consequential damages arising out of your use of eMoo, even if you advise us or we could reasonably foresee the possibility of any such damage occurring. Despite the above, if we are found to be liable, our liability to you or any third party (whether in contract, tort, negligence, strict liability in tort, by statute or otherwise) is limited to the greater of (a) the total fees you pay to us in the 12 months prior to the action giving rise to liability, and (b) 100 Bermuda Dollars.
<b>Indemnification.</b> You will indemnify and hold harmless eMoo and its affiliates and our and their respective officers, directors, agents and employees (each an "Indemnified Party"), from any claim made by any third party, together with any amounts payable to the third party whether in settlement or as may otherwise be awarded, and reasonable legal costs incurred by any of the Indemnified Parties, arising from or relating to your use of the eMoo Services, any alleged violation by you of the applicable terms, and any alleged violation by you of any applicable law or regulation. We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, but doing so will not excuse your indemnity obligations.</p><p>
<b>Personal Information.</b> By using eMoo Services, you agree to the collection, transfer, storage and use of your personal information by eMoo Ltd. (the "data controller") on servers located in the United States, Canada, Bermuda and in and our data centers in other parts of the world as further described in our privacy policy. By using eMoo Services, you also agree to the use of your personal information by eMoo Ltd. for any brand, promotional, communications or marketing related activity carried out by BPHL.</p><p>
<b>General.</b> These terms and the other policies posted on eMoo Services constitute the entire agreement between us and you, superseding any prior agreements. This agreement is governed by the laws of Bermuda and the federal laws of Bermuda applicable therein. We both submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of Bermuda. This will not affect your statutory rights if you are a consumer and applicable consumer law requires application of another law for certain topics. If we don't enforce any particular provision, we are not waiving our right to do so later. If a court strikes down any of these terms, the remaining terms will survive. We may automatically assign this agreement in our sole discretion in accordance with the notice provision below (our assignment to an affiliate will not require notice). We will send notices to you via the email address you provide, or by registered mail. Notices sent by registered mail will be deemed received five days following the date of mailing. We may update this agreement at any time, with updates taking effect when you next use the site or after 30 days, whichever is sooner. No other amendment to this agreement will be effective unless made in writing, signed by users and by us. Send questions, comments or complaints to eMoo Customer Support.
Mobile Devices Terms. If you're accessing eMoo Services from a mobile device using an eMoo Mobile Application (the "Application"), the following terms and conditions ("Terms of Use") apply to you in addition to the applicable Mobile Privacy and Legal Notice or End User License Agreement, as the case may be. Your use of the Application confirms your agreement to these Terms of Use.</p>
<p>
<b>Application Use.</b> eMoo grants you the right to use the Application only for your personal use. You must comply with all applicable laws and third party terms of agreement when using the Application (e.g. your wireless data service agreement). The Application may not contain the same functionality available on the www.eMoo.bm website.  Your download and use of the Application is at your own discretion and risk, and you are solely responsible for any damages to your hardware device(s) or loss of data that results from the download or use of the Application.
