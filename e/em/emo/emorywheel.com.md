This site collects first name, last name, email address, user name and password for all registered users. IP addresses are also collected (the location of your computer on the Internet).

If you are concerned about being identified or about having your web browsing traced through the use of a cookie, set your browser to not accept cookies. Please note that blocking all cookies prevents some online services from working. 

Emorywheel.com does not share, sell, trade, rent or give to other parties any information users of our site provide us. 

Emorywheel.com does not “spam” users and it is not our policy to send unsolicited email. As a registered user, however, you are requesting and will receive an email update of headlines with links back to our website with the publication of each print edition of the Emory Wheel. 

Emorywheel.com may contain links to other websites and is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of other sites. We suggest you consult these sites for their specific privacy policies.
