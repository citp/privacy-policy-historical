It may also be collected about you from the messages and posts and account activity of others regarding you. It also includes information like your browser type and IP address. We may use "cookies" to help us store and collect other information based on your browsing.<sup><a href="#cookie">[1]</a></sup></li>
      <li><a name="reg-test"></a>When you register as a <a href="/legal/terms/" title="">Registered User</a>, Empire Avenue will enable you to provide us with your login information for various third party sites (including but not limited to Facebook, Twitter, Flickr and your Blog site). Empire Avenue will then access your account and gather all necessary  information from these third party sites as dictated by your <a href="/profile/privacy" title="">Privacy Settings</a> on those sites and as required in providing scores, recommendations and share prices. This information is called Third Party Information. We will remove this Third Party Information from our system after a certain period of time (currently set at a month).</li></ol>
