In addition, where you request or authorise us:

If you do not provide us with the personal information described in this policy:

  * we may not be able to provide you with information about products and services that you requested;
  * we may not be able to provide you with the products or services you requested;
  * we may be unable to tailor the content of the Services to your preferences and your experience of the Services may therefore not be useful.

###  **8\. Storage & Security of Personal Information**

To provide the Services, Employment Hero contracts with Amazon Web Services (AWS) Australia who store data on secure data centres within Australia.  Further details on AWS’s location and security can be found [here.](https://aws.amazon.com/security/)

While we take all reasonable steps to ensure the security of our system, we cannot provide any guarantee regarding security of the personal information and other data transmitted to the Services and we will not be held responsible for events arising from unauthorised access of your personal information.

Employment Hero’s team includes members based in Vietnam and the Philippiness and as part of our processes data may be accessed or temporarily hosted offshore. Our entire team, including those outside Australia, is recruited, trained and managed by Employment Hero’s Sydney based management and access to personal information is subject to the same security and control procedures and policies across our whole business.

Where we disclose data overseas, we are required to take measures to ensure your information is treated in accordance with at least the standards that apply in Australia (other than when compelled to make disclosure under local laws).

We allow you to access your information at any time to keep it accurate and up to date. You can also play an important role in keeping your personal information secure, by maintaining the confidentiality of any password and accounts used on the Services. Please notify us immediately if there is any unauthorised use of your account by any other Internet user, or any other breach of security relating to your account at [support@employmenthero.com](mailto:support@employmenthero.com).

###  **9\. Links**

The Services may contain links to other websites operated by third parties. We make no representations or warranties in relation to the privacy practices of any third party website. Third party websites are responsible for informing you about their own privacy practices and policies.

###  **10\. Access to and Correction of your Personal Information**

If you wish to verify or correct any of the details you have submitted to us, you may do so by contacting us via support@employmenthero.com. You have the right to access the information which we hold about you and for corrections to be made to this information.

Our security procedures mean that we may request proof of identity before we reveal personal information. This proof of identity will take the form of your e-mail address and password submitted upon registration. You must therefore keep this information safe as you will be responsible for any action which we take in response to a request from someone using your email and password.

###  **11\. Contact Us**

Any questions or concerns that you have regarding this Privacy Policy or a breach of the Privacy Act should be directed to support@employmenthero.com.

Once we receive a complaint, whether it is in writing or verbal means, we will endeavour to commence an investigation as soon as practicable. The investigator will endeavour to determine the nature of the breach and how it occurred. We may contact you during the process to seek any further clarification if necessary. We will also contact you to inform you of the outcome of the investigation and where a breach is found we will discuss your concerns and outline options regarding how they can be resolved.

We will aim to ensure that all questions and concerns are resolved in a timely and appropriate manner.

If you are not satisfied with the outcome of your complaint, or require further information on privacy, you are entitled to contact the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (www.oaic.gov.au).

###  **12\. Privacy Policy Amendment**

From time to time, we may review and update our Privacy policy. Revised versions will be updated on the Services.
