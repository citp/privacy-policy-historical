# Privacy Policy | Employment Hero

As the owner and operator of [https://www.employmenthero.com](http://www.employmenthero.com/), the Employment Hero website (“ **Site** ”), Employment Hero Pty Ltd (“ **we** ”/“ **our** ”/” **us** ”) and its related bodies corporate (as that term is defined in the _Corporations Act 2001_ (Cth) (“ **Related Bodies Corporate** ”) and our contractors are required to collect, store and use information about you, as a user of the Site, and third parties including your employees and prospective employees and contractors and prospective contractors (collectively, “ **Site Users** ”) in order to provide the Employment Hero services and any associated support (“ **Services** ”).

We are committed to protecting the privacy of all personal information (as defined by this Privacy Policy) stored on the Site and provided by you in connection with the Services. The  _Privacy Act 1988_  (Cth) (“ **Act** ”) governs the way we collect, use, disclose and store your personal information. This Privacy Policy describes how we aim to adhere to those principles contained within the Act.

### Personal Information

For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, personal information means information or an opinion (including information or an opinion forming part of a database), whether true or not, and whether recorded in a material form or not, about an individual whose identity is apparent, or can reasonably be ascertained, from the information or opinion. Examples of personal information which may be collected and stored on the Site may include:

  * names and addresses of Site Users;
  * details regarding gender, nationality and marital status of Site Users;
  * dates of birth and phone numbers of Site Users;
  * email addresses of Site Users; and
  * computer IP addresses of Site Users.



### Privacy Principles

Subject to the other provisions of this Privacy Policy, we adhere to the following general privacy principles:

  * We only collect personal information by fair, lawful and non-intrusive means.
  * We only use or disclose information for the purpose for which it was collected.
  * We take reasonable steps to ensure the personal information we collect, use or disclose is accurate and up-to-date.
  * We have procedures in place to protect the personal information we hold from misuse, loss or unauthorised access.
  * We clearly set out our management of personal information in this Privacy Policy, which we make available to anyone who asks for it.
  * We provide individual access to personal information held about the individual, and if we cannot provide access we will give reasonable written reasons for declining the request.
  * We will use Commonwealth Government identifiers for the purpose for which they were issued, and we will not adopt our own identifiers of an individual except where it is necessary to carry out our functions effectively.
  * Given the nature of the Services, you will need to identify yourself using personal information in order to access and use the Site.
  * We will only transfer personal information to a recipient in a foreign jurisdiction in circumstances where the information will have an appropriate level of protection.



We do not collect sensitive information, such as information on the health or criminal record of an individual, unless the individual has consented or it is required by law, or in special circumstances relating to the health and safety of an individual or the public in general.

### Collection of Personal Information

We may collect personal information from Site Users in various ways, including by way of dealing with you in person, over the telephone, through the Site (including details entered upon registration for use of the Site or use of any of the template documents) or email server, or through customer feedback or survey forms. We may also collect personal information relating to third parties through your use of the Site or through their use of the Site as Site Users.  We may collect personal information about Site Users from a third party where the Site User has consented to the personal information being provided by a third party (for example where you provide information about one of your employees to the Site for the purpose of using the Services).

### Use of Personal Information

We usually collect personal information so that we can provide Site Users with the Services. We may also use personal information for other reasons, including updating you on our latest products, services and news (unless you tell us not to – which you can do at any time by emailing us at support@employmenthero.com).

### Disclosure of Personal Information

We may disclose your personal information to any of the Related Bodies Corporate or any of our contractors, as we see fit for the purposes of our business and providing the Services.

If we disclose personal information about a Site User to any of the Related Bodies Corporate or our contractors, they may use it for the same purposes that we may, namely for providing the Services and also so that they can update you on their latest products, news and special offers via e-mail, post & telephone.

Additionally, we may disclose personal information regarding Site Users where such information is provided by Site Users, provided that such disclosure is:

  * indicated at the time of supply of the information to us;
  * expressly permitted under any agreement between us and you;
  * required for performance of the Services;
  * required for the ordinary operation of the Site or our business (eg to send you information about the Services or any of our other services);
  * required under compulsion of law or provided in co-operation with any governmental authority; or
  * of personal information that is already publicly available or is disclosed by us in a manner that does not readily permit identification of personal information relating to you.



### Cookies and Statistical Analysis

The Site uses cookies. When a Site User visits the Site, certain information may be recorded for statistical purposes, including information regarding a Site User’s:

  * server address;
  * domain name;
  * date and time of visit;
  * previous websites visited; and
  * browser type.



### Site and Information Security

Although we have implemented substantial security measures in relation to personal information, as the Site is linked to the internet (and the internet is inherently insecure) we cannot provide any guarantee regarding security of the personal information and other data transmitted to the Site. We will not be liable in any way in relation to any breach of security or unintended loss or disclosure of personal information or other data due to the Site being linked to the internet. Furthermore, although we will not give any of your personal information to a third party without your permission except in circumstances permitted or required under the Act, we will not be liable in any way for the actions of third party sites from which you may have linked and been directed to from our Site. When we no longer need your personal information in order to provide the Services and there is no obligation under law (either for us or any Site Users) to retain the personal information, we will take steps which are reasonable in the circumstances to delete or de-identify the personal information.

### Third Party Sites

The Site may contain links to and from the websites of third parties (“ **Third Party Sites** ”). If you follow a link to any of these Third Party Sites, please note that they have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for the use of any personal information or other data by third parties.

### Transfers of personal information outside Australia

The personal information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside Australia for the purpose of providing the Services and for other purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. The personal information may also be processed by individuals working outside of Australia who work for any of the Related Bodies Corporate or who are or work for contractors of us or the Related Bodies Corporate. Such processing may, for example, be required in order to provide support and signature services or for development works on the Site.

### Access to and correction of your personal information

If you wish to verify or correct any of the details you have submitted to us, you may do so by contacting us via support@employmenthero.com. Our security procedures mean that we may request proof of identity before we reveal personal information. This proof of identity will take the form of your e-mail address and password submitted upon registration. You must therefore keep this information safe as you will be responsible for any action which we take in response to a request from someone using your e-mail and password. You have the right to access the information which we hold about you and can also ask for corrections to be made to this information.

### Questions and concerns

Any questions or concerns that a Site User has regarding this Privacy Policy or a breach of the Act should be directed to support@employmenthero.com.  We will endeavour to look into your question or concern and respond to you as soon as possible.

### Privacy Policy Amendment

We reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time and will publish all amendments on the Site.
