# EmptyEasel Privacy Policy

I'm not a lawyer by any means, but I thought I should at least take a moment to write out EmptyEasel's privacy policy. Here are the details if you're interested. 

1\. EmptyEasel may log your IP address to make sure everything is working properly and to keep track of overall traffic statistics. All IP addresses are kept private. 

2\. EmptyEasel also uses cookies to store some information. For example, I keep track of which pages are most visited, which pages visitors arrive at, time of visits, etc. However, no personally identifiable information is ever collected. In a similar way, the Google Adsense ads on EmptyEasel make use of cookies too, so you may see some ads that relate to your prior search activity. If you'd like to opt out of Google's ad targeting process you can visit Google's [Advertising and Privacy Page](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html). 

3\. If you choose to share your email address with me via the [contact form](https://web.archive.org/contact/), [artwork submission form](https://web.archive.org/artwork-submission-form/), or [article submission form](https://web.archive.org/article-submission-form/) that address will never be given or sold to a third party. I may use your email address to contact you, but that's about it. 

4\. If you choose to sign up for the free [weekly newsletter](https://web.archive.org/newsletter), your email address will be recorded and kept secure through Feedburner, which I use to distribute my weekly email. Neither Feedburner nor myself will give or sell your address to any third party. 

Naturally, after signing up you'll receive weekly emails from EmptyEasel, but you can unsubscribe from that service at any time. 

5\. You'll notice that throughout EmptyEasel there are links to other websites which I have no control over. Your privacy is assured _here_ , but obviously I cannot guarantee what these other sites may do with your information. 

And. . . that's all there is to it. If you have a question about privacy that's not covered here, please [contact me](https://web.archive.org/contact/) and I'll do my best to answer it.
