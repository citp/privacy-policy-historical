**Providing your social security number is not mandatory.** If you would like to register without providing your social security number, please ask a local One-Stop representative for assistance. If you are not in a One-Stop center, please call 1-800-438-4128 for assistance. This process may take up to thirty minutes for staff to collect the necessary information and create a full registration in the EFM System.

For your protection, please do not use your social security number or FEIN when creating your user name.

Your information allows us to assist you in the following ways:

  * Personally identifying information, including name and social security number, is used to establish an EFM record.
  * Contact information such as home address, telephone number and electronic mail address is used to reach you when a suitable job is available or to schedule other employment-related services.
  * Personal information regarding age, ethnic group and gender is used strictly for statistical purposes to identify which segments of the population are being served. Based on this information, the system can be improved to better serve its users. Statistical information never identifies a specific user.
  * Employment information, including work history and occupational objectives, is used to match you with job openings. With your prior approval, this information can be provided directly to employers in the form of an electronic resume.
  * Service information, including a record of case-management services provided by One-Stop staff, is used to determine the appropriate type of service for you and to measure accomplishments.
  * Employer information such as position descriptions, job titles, number of openings, position locations, duties, hours, wages, and other skill and experience requirements, is used to match job seekers to job openings.
