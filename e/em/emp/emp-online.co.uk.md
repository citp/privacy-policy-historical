## Retargeting

We use retargeting technology from a third party supplier: Criteo GmbH ([www.criteo.com](http://www.criteo.com/)) for our online shop. This makes it possible to provide Internet users who are already interested in our shop and the products in it with targeted advertising. Studies show that advertising with personalised product recommendations is more interesting to customers than ads with little or no personal connection. In addition, the advertisements for products that are probably of interest to you make it easier to go back directly to the advertised products. Because people are frequently interrupted in their online shopping and later have difficulty finding the products they had picked out before. Personalised banners, however, lead you back directly to the products easily.

If you do not wish to use this function during your visit to our site, you can opt out **here**.
