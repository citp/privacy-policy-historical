EmploymentSpot Privacy Policy

StartSpot Mediaworks values the trust its visitors place in the company and strives to adhere to the highest ethical standards in safeguarding customer information. In short, we respect your privacy.

StartSpot Mediaworks does not rent, sell or exchange information about its visitors. Access to information about our sites' visitors is restricted to StartSpot Mediaworks, Inc. We accept or collect only the information that is needed to administer business, provide service and communicate offers that we truly believe will be of interest to our visitors.

If, at any time, visitors wish to be removed from any list, including monthly site newsletter lists, StartSpot Mediaworks will be glad to delete their e-mail addresses from existing files.

Children

StartSpot Mediaworks does not intend to accept or collect personally-identifiable information (name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address) from children (individuals under the age of 13) or use that information for marketing purposes.

If a child has provided StartSpot Mediaworks with an e-mail address, we ask that a parent or guardian of the child contact [webmaster@startspot.com](mailto:webmaster@startspot.com) if they would like the e-mail address deleted from StartSpot lists. StartSpot Mediaworks will use reasonable efforts to delete their e-mail addresses from existing files.

This policy is not intended to be a contractual obligation of any kind. It is intended to set forth StartSpot Mediaworks' current policy. StartSpot Mediaworks will take reasonable measures to implement this policy.
