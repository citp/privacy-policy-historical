### 2 Collected data and purpose of data use

We will collect personal data on the basis of your consent, to perform contracts with you and/or to perform legal obligations. Personal data include any information related to an identified or identifiable natural person.

### 2.1 Usage data

When you visit our website or use the EMP app, we will collect usage data (for example, your browser, times of access, product pages you visit, device data, version of the app, etc.) for statistical purposes, to optimize our products and services, and to guarantee system security.

### 2.2  Data collected when you place an order as a non-registered user

If you place an order without registering ("order as a guest"), we will store the personal data we need to process the transaction (name, address, e-mail address, payment information).  In addition, you may provide us with your telephone number, so that we can reach you more quickly if we have any questions. If you have filled out the optional field "date of birth," we will also send you our birthday special. Guest customers also benefit from our international customer service.

We will process your personal data to process and fill your order and to optimize our products and customer services. To process and fill your order, to ship products, or to process and maintain customer data, we will transfer personal data to specialized service providers, such as shipping companies.

### 2.3 Data collected when you place an order as a registered user

Ordering from EMP is very convenient. We offer free registration – in which case your personal data will be stored in a password-protected customer account independently of any particular order. Your EMP customer account will simplify the ordering process and offers the following:

  * Products will be placed in your shopping basket, allowing you to continue shopping
  * There is no need for you to reenter your data every time you place an order
  * You have access to your data from anywhere and can use the international customer service of EMP
  * You can change your personal data under "Your Account" or delete your customer account in the Online Shop (see below)
  * Registration is absolutely free and requires no purchase on your part.



To create a customer account, we will need your name and your e-mail address. In addition, you may provide your telephone number and your date of birth. You may view your customer account and the data stored in your account at any time. You can do so in your personal area under "Your Account" (after you have logged in). To delete your customer account in the Online Shop, please use the link "Delete Account." Please note that if you delete your account, data that have been collected for your customer account will be erased from the customer account in the Online Shop unless they are needed for filling open orders and/or to perform legal obligations, and that if you were to place a new order, you would have to reenter your data.

To prevent any misuse of your customer account, be sure to log out from your customer account after every session/registration. Some browsers allow you to save the username and password and to automatically fill in this information the next time you access the login page. Especially when you use a public computer or if you share a computer with another user, you should keep this in mind.

If you want to become a member of the Backstage Club, you will first have to create a customer account. Data collected by us will then also be processed for the services offered to members of the Backstage Club.
