            <br><br>
            <strong>Why is your privacy so important to us?</strong><br>
            EmploymentCrossing is committed to protecting the privacy of our users, and we are firmly devoted to maintaining your trust in us. We work extremely hard at safeguarding our customers' important information and keeping it secure. Our privacy policy is designed to help you understand our genuine dedication to preserving your privacy. 
			<br><br>
			Confidentiality and discretion are the cornerstones of every job search. We consistently challenge ourselves to rise above every competitor in our honesty and discretion, and we believe we have met this challenge day after day. 
			<br><br>
            <strong>What personally identifiable information is collected on this site?</strong><br>
            In order to register as an EmploymentCrossing member, users are required to provide pertinent contact information such as their name, an email address, and a mailing address. To complete the sign-up process and subscribe to the service, users are also required to provide financial information, in the form of a valid credit card number and billing address. After subscribing, members may also provide personally identifiable information for other purposes in their use of the site. This includes, but is not limited to, submitting a resume or cover letter. However, any submitted resume or cover letter is viewable only by the person who uploaded or pasted it into the account. Any transmission of these materials can only be achieved through the initiative of the user. EmploymentCrossing does not collect personal information from its subscribers unless they voluntarily and knowingly provide it to us. This means that a user can visit our site without telling us who they are and without revealing any personally identifiable information. The site visitor is never required to provide any personally identifiable information, unless he or she would like to subscribe to the service.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Tell-A-Friend</strong><br>
            If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, you are asked to provide a friend's name and email address. EmploymentCrossing will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. EmploymentCrossing does not store this information.
            <br><br>
            <strong>How is the information used?</strong><br>
            When you supply personal information about yourself for a specific purpose, we use the information for only that purpose (such as to provide the service or information you have requested). Your contact information may also be used to contact you when necessary in order to respond to your inquiries regarding the service. Every communication with EmploymentCrossing is held in strictest confidence and handled with integrity. None of your personal information will be disclosed to a potential employer without you taking affirmative action to disclose this information. Your personal information will not be disclosed to third parties under any circumstances, except as disclosed in this privacy statement. Any general demographic information that we receive will never be utilized to identify you. While it may be used for research purposes in order to further develop our understanding of the job market or to improve the Web site, none of this demographic information is attributable to your account. This general information may be disseminated or published in its basic form. 
			<br><br>
			EmploymentCrossing will never sell any personal information about any of our customers to any third parties. We will never sell your email address or any other contact information to any third parties for any purpose. 
			<br><br>
			EmploymentCrossing will absolutely never share any information relating to your employment situation with any third parties. We will absolutely never share any information from your resume with any third parties. Any such information which you provide to us will remain completely confidential. Each employee of EmploymentCrossing signs a strict confidentiality and nondisclosure agreement to ensure your privacy. 
			<br><br>
			EmploymentCrossing is a dba of LawCrossing, one of the Juriscape companies, which include Attorney Resume, BCG Attorney Search, EdFed, General Counsel Consulting, JD2B, LawCrossing, Law School Loans, Law Firm Staff, Legal Authority, Law School Loan Report, and SouthLake Properties LLP. Each company is a distinct and separately incorporated entity, and each company's databases and servers are maintained independently. The fact that you contacted EmploymentCrossing will never be shared with any other Juriscape company or its employees. Each employee of each company signs a strict confidentiality and nondisclosure agreement, ensuring that they do not disclose your private information to any other person or company. 
			<br><br>
			After contacting EmploymentCrossing, you may be notified of the potentially complementary services of another Juriscape company. However, no information regarding your employment status, or information from your resume, will ever be shared with any other Juriscape company. Furthermore, the fact that the offer is coming from another Juriscape company will be fully disclosed in the mailing, and you may opt out of such offers at any time as described below. No information will be used for purposes of such offers except your name, contact address, and year of graduation if applicable, and access to such information will be restricted to the sole purpose of communicating with you. Moreover, all other personal information, such as employment status or information from your resume, will absolutely never be shared with any other Juriscape company. 
			<br><br>
			Should any material changes be made to the manner in which we use personally identifiable information, EmploymentCrossing will post the changes on our Web site no less than 30 days prior to a change. This is done in order to give users time to request removal of their information from our database or to make inquiries about any new practices.
			<br><br>
            <strong>Security</strong><br>
            Personally identifiable information is stored on our database and is not publicly accessible. All EmploymentCrossing employees must sign non-disclosure contracts that ensure the confidentiality of all personally identifiable information before gaining access to such information.
