If you do not want to receive email or other communications from us, you can also contact us at <a href="mailto:%63%6f%6e%74%61%63%74@%69%6e%64%69%65%6c%61%62%73.%63%6f%6d">contact (at) indielabs.com</a>. However, as part of your registration for the Services, you may receive certain communications from Indie Labs, such as administrative announcements and customer service messages regarding the Services and products, and you will not be able to opt out of receiving such communications.</p>
	<p>From time to time, we may implement solutions designed to more efficiently capture your communications preferences. In any such event, we will strive to reflect any previously stated communicated preferences within such solutions.</p>
	<p>We do not sell or rent your Personal Information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. We may share and you hereby consent to our sharing of personal information with the following:</p>

		<li>Entities who acquire Us or assets from Us. In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information, including your Personal Information, is typically one of the business assets that are transferred. Moreover, if Indie Labs, all or our assets or the Site were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Indie Labs goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information, including your Personal Information, would be one of the assets that is transferred to or acquired by a third party.
