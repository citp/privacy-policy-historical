# Privacy Policy - Empxtrack

## Privacy Policy

(updated on : 25th may, 2018)

Empxtrack recognizes the need for appropriate protections and management of your personal information that you provide to us. We are committed to the highest standards in protecting and safeguarding your right to privacy while using and interacting with our Web site. By using our Web site or providing any personal information using our Web site, you are agreeing to the collection and use of information in the manner described in this Privacy Policy.

While you can access most areas of our Web site without submitting any personal data, there are certain areas of our site that request specific personal information including name, title, phone number, and e-mail address. Our intent is to allow you as much control as possible over your personal information.

This privacy policy aims to give you information on how Empxtrack collects and processes your personal data through your use of this website, including any data you may provide through this website when you sign up to our newsletter, sign-up for a trial of our products or services, or take part in a webinar.

This website is not intended for children and we do not knowingly collect data relating to children.

It is important that you read this privacy policy together with any other privacy policy we may provide on specific occasions when we are collecting or processing personal data about you so that you are fully aware of how and why we are using your data. This privacy policy supplements the other notices and is not intended to override them.

Unlike our websites, most of the products and services of Empxtrack are intended for use by our business customers, and your use of them is administered by your company.

In such cases, authorized personnel at your company may have access to your personal information processed by Empxtrack, and your company may have policies applicable to your use of them. Empxtrack is not responsible for our business customers’ policies and practices related to data privacy and security, which may be different from this privacy policy and any applicable notice provide by our business customers.

If your company is administering your use of Empxtrack, please contact your company with any privacy questions related to your use of that Empxtrack.

The goal of this policy is to make explicit the information we gather on our customers and users, how we will use it, and how we will not.
