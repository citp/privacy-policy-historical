_This document updated: 19/04/2011_

#### Empire Kred Pty Ltd. (Empire.Kred) considers issues relating to your privacy to be a serious matter. As such, Empire.Kred has created and implemented this Privacy Policy so that you understand what Empire.Kred may and may not do with certain Personal Information. 

#### This Privacy Policy describes the guidelines Empire Avenue uses to protect the information we collect about you during your visit(s) to the Empire.Kred Web site ( the “Web Site”). By registering on the Web Site you consent to the collection and use of information described below and in the [Web Site Terms and Conditions of Use](https://web.archive.org/legal/terms). 

#### This Privacy Policy will apply to all websites of Empire Avenue that link to this Privacy Policy. Information will be shared with other users in accordance with this Policy and your [Privacy Settings](https://web.archive.org/profile/privacy). You are encouraged to review your [Privacy Settings](https://web.archive.org/profile/privacy) on a regular basis to ensure the levels are set appropriately. 

### Collection of Information

Empire.Kred will collect information of three types about you: (1) Personal Information, (2) Web Site Information, and (3) Third Party Information.

  1. Personal Information refers to information that you provide us directly (i.e. through the forms on the site). This includes but is not limited to your name, photo, your date of birth, your e-mail address, your country, your interests, your profile information etc. 
  2. Web Site Information is information that Empire.Kred collects about you during use of the Website. This can be information obtained from posts on your profile pages, your private messaging, and other account activity. It may also be collected about you from the messages and posts and account activity of others regarding you. It also includes information like your browser type and IP address. We may use "cookies" to help us store and collect other information based on your browsing.[1]
  3. When you register as a [Registered User](https://web.archive.org/legal/terms/), Empire.Kred will enable you to provide us with your login information for various third party sites (including but not limited to Facebook, Twitter, Flickr and your Blog site). Empire.Kred will then access your account and gather all necessary information from these third party sites as dictated by your [Privacy Settings](https://web.archive.org/profile/privacy) on those sites and as required in providing scores, recommendations and share prices. This information is called Third Party Information. We will remove this Third Party Information from our system after a certain period of time (currently set at a month). 



The information set out in subparagraphs (2) and (3) above will be gathered by an automated system and will not be available in its original format unless you have given us explicit permission via your [Privacy Settings](https://web.archive.org/profile/privacy). 

### Children Under Age 13

If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register with Empire.Kred or send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete any personal information as quickly as possible.
