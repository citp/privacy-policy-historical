Security & Privacy   
The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our clients and their customers is of utmost concern to us.

We store the information in a database in a secure environment at a Class A Internet service provider. 

Only those employees who need access to your information in order to do their jobs are allowed access, each having signed comprehensive nondisclosure agreements, which provide explicit legal confidentiality protections. _Any employee who violates our privacy and/or security policies is subject to disciplinary action, including possible termination and civil and/or criminal prosecution._

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.

Client E-Mail Campaigns

e-Dialog delivers permission-based electronic marketing campaigns, newsletters and product offerings via e-mail on behalf of our clients. E-mail is sent only to people who have agreed to receive these mailings. 

  * In some cases, e-Dialog stores database lists from our clients. These lists may contain e-mail addresses, street address, contact information and other relevant information. Confidentiality of the client list is a top priority. e-Dialog is contractually bound to keep our clients' customer data private. A client's list is never shared with other clients, partners, etc., and is treated as an asset of our client. 
  * e-Dialog tracks if a recipient has the ability to support HTML e-mail in their e-mail client, as well as whether an HTML e-mail message has been opened or previewed. This capability is used only to deliver the best content to the recipient, and the recipient always has control to change their profile by contacting the client for whom the campaign was deployed. 
  * Information regarding the activity of e-mail recipients is only reported to the client who deployed the e-mail through e-Dialog. Information about specific e-mail recipients is only shared with the client who owns the list on which the e-mail recipients e-mail address originally appeared. 
  * Some e-Dialog clients use Campaign Builder, a self-service product to send their own e-mail campaigns. e-Dialog's policy against sending unsolicited commercial e-mail applies to this product as well. If e-Dialog determines that a client has knowingly used our system for sending unsolicited commercial e-mail, e-Dialog will revoke the right of this client to send e-mail using our product and sending e-mail from our system.
  * e-Dialog does not sell, share or rent the mailing list of our clients.
