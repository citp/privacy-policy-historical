### Overseas Disclosure of Personal Information

As a global organisation, we may store, use, transfer, and otherwise process your personal information in countries outside of the country of your residence. By using our Services, you consent to Edrolo’s transfer to and handling of your personal information in a jurisdiction which may have different (and less stringent) data protection rules than the country in which you reside.

Edrolo stores customer data in the cloud (it would be basically impossible to deliver our resources to students and teachers without doing so). Staff at Edrolo have secure access to this data, and tiered levels of staff access to this information, too. Our databases (containing Name, Contact Details and Subject Enrolments) are stored with Amazon Web Services (AWS) in the Asia Pacific Region (Sydney). Schools can take confidence from our deliberate choice of reliable, high-quality providers, like AWS, who set the industry standards for information security, and operate under the strongest compliance standards and industry certifications. It is of paramount importance to both AWS and us that your data is private and secure. If you have further questions regarding AWS standards and protocols, AWS house a comprehensive set of compliance resources on their website which can be accessed [here](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/resources/).

### Marketing

Where we use your personal information to send you marketing and promotional information, you will be provided with an opportunity to opt-out of receiving such information. Unless you exercise your right to opt-out of such communication, you will be taken to have consented to the receipt of similar information and communications in the future. 

### Website Usage, Tracking Information and Cookies

We collect limited information about people who use our Services so that we can track the use of those resources, maintain and improve our Services, and understand how our users navigate through and use our Services. We do not use these technologies for tracking of any information about your use of other websites or services. Information we collect may include:

  * server and/or internet protocol (IP) addresses;
  * top level domain names;
  * the date, time and duration of your visit;
  * pages accessed and documents downloaded;

  * whether you are a returning visitor;
  * the type of browser used,

(collectively, “ **Usage Information** ”).

In order to collect Usage Information, we may use software embedded in our Websites (such as JavaScript) and we may place small data files (cookies) on your computer or other device. We may also use similar means, including third party services such as Google Analytics, to track Usage Information in relation to our products and services.

Unless you have registered for an account with us and are logged in to our Services, we will not link Usage Information to your personal information such as your user name. If you register for an account with us, Usage Information while you are logged in to the Services will be associated with your registration data.

### Storage of Personal Information

We will retain your information for as long as permitted under the _Privacy Act 1988_ (Cth), or to comply with our legal obligations. When we dispose of personal information, we ensure that it is destroyed or de-identified in a secure fashion according to industry standards and as required by law.

### Security of Personal Information

We take all reasonable steps to keep the personal information we hold about you secure and free from loss, misuse or interference. Personal information we collect and store is stored on secure servers, and is only accessible by those persons who need access to the information in order to carry out their business functions. We also maintain physical security measures to protect the use and storage of physical records containing personal information. However, you acknowledge that no method of transmission or electronic storage is completely secure, and we cannot control the security of data collected, stored, and disclosed on third party platforms. You transfer and store your information at your own risk. You are also responsible for the security of your personal information by taking precautionary measures, such as keeping your account password confidential and using secure wireless connections.

### Accessing Your Personal Information

You may request that we provide you with access to the personal information we hold about you by contacting us using the contact details provided at the end of this Privacy Policy. However, privacy and data legislation in your jurisdiction may set out certain circumstances where we may deny, or only partially comply with such a request. These circumstances may include, for example, where:

  * access would pose a serious threat to the life, safety or health of any individual or to public health or public safety;
  * access would have an unreasonable impact on the privacy of other individuals;
  * the request is frivolous or vexatious;
  * denying access is required or authorised by a law or a court or tribunal order;
  * access would be unlawful; or
  * access may prejudice commercial negotiations, legal proceedings, enforcement activities or appropriate action being taken in respect of a suspected unlawful activity or serious misconduct.



If you require access to any information we hold about you, we request that you identify, as clearly as possible, the type of information requested. We will respond to your request to provide access to your personal information within a reasonable period after the request is made, and you agree we may charge you our reasonable costs incurred in supplying you with this information as permitted under the _Privacy Act 1988_ (Cth).

### Updating Your Personal Information

We take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to ensure that:

  * the personal information we collect and store, is accurate, up to date and complete; and
  * the personal information we use and disclose is accurate, up to date, complete and relevant. 



If you believe that information we hold about you may not be up to date, complete and accurate, you may notify us by contacting us using the contact details below.

You accept that we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity if you contact us with such a request.

### Anonymity and Pseudonymity

If you are making a general enquiry only, you may deal with us on an anonymous basis or through the use of a pseudonym. However, we will not be able to provide you with any specific information about your account if you fail to identify yourself to us.

### Third-Party Links

Our Website, products, and services may include links to other websites whose privacy practices may differ from ours. If you provide your personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies.
