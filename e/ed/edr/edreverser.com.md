The ED Reverser System is not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices of third web sites or applications. 

**1\. Collection of Information.**

**1.1 Survey Information.**

The ED Reverser System collects information from individuals by various methods, including, but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes a The ED Reverser System survey, order form, or a registration pages either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a "Survey"). (As used herein, "online" means using the Internet, including the Websites, and related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, The ED Reverser System or a third party (a "Third Party") may ask an individual to provide various information to The ED Reverser System , which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, "Survey Information"). The ED Reverser System may also collect information concerning an individual from another source and uses that information in combination with information provided from this web site. Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to The ED Reverser System or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from The ED Reverser System or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to The ED Reverser System. 

**1.2 Other Information.**

Other occasions when The ED Reverser System obtains information from individuals include (1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by The ED Reverser System or by a third party, (2) when an individual requests assistance through The ED Reverser System's customer service department, and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a The ED Reverser System service or newsletter (together, "Other Information"). 

**1.3 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.**

The ED Reverser System currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, The ED Reverser System may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, "Technology Information"). 

**(a) Cookies.**

A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows The ED Reverser System to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in The ED Reverser System's database. You may read more about cookies at [http://cookiecentral.com](http://cookiecentral.com/). Individuals who use the Websites need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Websites. 

**(b) Web Beacons.**

A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an programming function -- see [http://truste.org](http://truste.org/) for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows The ED Reverser System to track certain web sites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, The ED Reverser System might place, with the consent of a third party website, a web beacon on the third party's website where fishing products are sold. When Bill, an individual listed in The ED Reverser System's database, visits the fishing website, The ED Reverser System receives notice by means of the web beacon that Bill visited the fishing site, and The ED Reverser System would then update Bill's profile with the information that Bill is interested in fishing. The ED Reverser System may thereafter present offers of fishing related products and services to Bill. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, The ED Reverser System also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in The ED Reverser System's database. 

**(c) New Technology.**

The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is The ED Reverser System's use of new and evolving technology.
