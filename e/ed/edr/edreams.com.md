##  Why do we collect your personal data and which legal basis do we rely on? 

**I. Booking.** During the purchase process, we ask you only for the personal data that we need to provide you with our mediation services to contract travel products. This includes completing and managing your booking, sending you communications by email, call or SMS in relation to your booking (e.g. confirmations, modifications and reminders), allowing us to respond to your queries. Such communications could be managed by us or by our travel partners. The booking process can be done on our website, our app, our customer service… We endeavour to show to you the most relevant travel information and help you in a personalized manner with your booking and post-booking. 

Please bear in mind that the identification data we use is going to be your email that you introduce in your booking/account.

Legal basis: This processing is necessary for the performance of the contract (e.g. to finalize and manage your booking).

**II. User account.** Our users can create a user account on our websites or apps. We use such information you give us to manage your account and with the objective to show you the most relevant travel booking and post-booking experience, allowing you to do a number of useful things. For more information about any of our services, please go to our [General terms and conditions](https://www.edreams.com/terms-and-conditions/). Legal basis: This processing is necessary for the performance of the contract (e.g. to manage your account and offer you a more personalized service).

**III. Other services.** We may offer you other travel related services based on our role as a travel agent. This Privacy Policy shall apply to such data processing based on other travel related services. During the contracting process, prior or when filling in the data, we will inform you if there is any specific information that you should know apart from the one already covered in this Privacy Policy. Legal basis: This processing is necessary for the performance of the contract, to provide you with our services, or consent.

**IV. Communications with you.** There could be a number of reasons for different kinds of communications that we process where we get in touch with you: 

a. To respond to any query or request from you or any travel provider and handle it.

b. To contact you in a personalized manner and help you to finish your booking, if you are still interested, in case you have not finalized a booking online (as we believe that this additional service benefits you as it allows you to carry on with a booking without having to fill in your reservation details again). We also keep it to recognize you when you visit our website again, in order to improve your user experience. 

c. To invite you to provide a review of your experience with us or the travel provider, when you use our services. Please bear in mind that this feedback may be available to other customers to help them take decision about a product or a service.

d. To inform you how to contact us if you need assistance while you are away or other information that we feel might be useful to you in your planning or getting the best of your trip, or information of upcoming trips or a summary of previous bookings you made with us.

e. We may need to send you other administrative messages, which may include security alerts. Legal basis: This processing may rely on the necessity for the performance of the contract, on our legitimate commercial business interest to provide our services or on your consent.

**V. Marketing activities.** We use your information for marketing purposes, such as for: 

a. To send you regular news of travel-related products and services, which you can unsubscribe from email marketing communications easily and at any moment, just by clicking on the unsubscribe link included in each newsletter or other communication.

b. To show to you individualized offers on our website, app or third-party platforms (including social media sites) and the content of the site displayed to you may be personalized. Such offers can be booked on our site, on co-branded sites, or other third-party offers or products we think you might find interesting.

c. To administer any promotional activity where you participate.

When you book with us, we subscribe you to our newsletters, unless you say otherwise before confirming your booking. Anyway, remember that you will be able to unsubscribe at any moment. Legal basis: This processing relies on our legitimate commercial business interest to provide our services or on your consent.

**VI. Customers polls and surveys.** You may be invited to submit a review on a trip you have booked with us or to take part in market research. In this last case, we will explain the personal data collected and how would it be used further. 

Legal basis: This processing relies on our legitimate commercial business interest to improve our services or on your consent.

**VII. Call & chat monitoring.** In the event of contacting our customer services, our staff may ask for authentications, ensuring that your reservation details are kept confidential. Not all calls or chats are recorded and recordings are kept for a limited amount of time and automatically deleted thereafter (unless we have a legitimate interest to keep such recording for a longer period, including fraud investigation and legal purposes). 

Legal basis: This processing basically relies on our legitimate commercial business interest to improve our services (e.g. for quality control or training purposes), on your consent, or for legal dispute purposes.

**VIII. Improving our services or developing new services.** We also use personal data for analytical purposes. This is part of our drive to enhance the user experience, but can also be used for testing purposes, troubleshooting and to improve the functionality and quality of our online travel services. The main goal here is to optimize our online platform to your needs, making our site easier and more enjoyable to use. We strive to use pseudonymized or anonymized data for theses analytical purposes. 

Legal basis: This processing relies on our legitimate commercial business interest to improve our services.

**IX. Promotion of a safe and trustworthy service.** In order to create a trustworthy environment for you, your fellow travellers, our business partners and our travel providers, we may use personal data for the detection and prevention of fraud and other illegal or unwanted activities, as well as for security purposes (e.g. authentication of users and bookings). For such purposes, we may have to stop or put on hold certain bookings. 

One example of this is our five-attempt password policy (if you incorrectly enter your password more than five times, we will block your account, requiring you to change your password).

Another example is our preventive stolen-credential control on the internet (if we could have any hint that your credentials could have been compromised, we may also block your account and ask you to reactivate it with a new password).

With these examples, among other actions, we protect your data and reduce fraud risk.

Legal basis: This processing relies on our legitimate commercial business interest to prevent fraud. Legal obligations could also apply.

**X. Legal purposes.** Finally, in certain cases, we may need to use your information to handle and resolve legal disputes, for regulatory investigations and compliance, to enforce our Terms or to comply with lawful requests from law enforcement. 

Legal basis: This processing relies on legal obligation compliance.

We do not make automated decisions based on profiles, beyond the legitimate prevention of fraud on the internet and the customization of your user experience, marketing and advertising. In any case, such an automated decision will not produce legal effects or similarly significantly affects you.

**I. Travel partners** (e.g. the airline which has to issue your ticket and/or operate your flight, the hotel you have booked, the car rental company you have contracted with us, etc.). In order to provide you with our services, we need to communicate your personal data to the Travel Providers involved, in order that they can provide you with the products or services you have requested, as well as those other parties to which it is necessary to disclose your personal data in order to provide you with the requested services in a diligent manner.

**III. International data transfers.** Our servers are located within the European Union. However, to facilitate our global operations (i.e. by means of third party service providers) the transmission of personal data to the recipients described above may include overseas transfers of personal data to countries whose data protection laws are not as comprehensive as those of the countries within the European Union.
