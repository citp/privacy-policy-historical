# EdSurge Privacy Policy

### EdSurge's Privacy Policy

This website is owned and operated by EdSurge, Inc. ("EdSurge" or "We"). We know you value your privacy. This Privacy Policy governs information we receive from you or about you and explains how we may collect, use, and in some instances share this information. 

#### Information we collect and how we use it 

In order to provide and enhance our website and services, we may collect the following types of information: 

**Information you provide** \- EdSurge collects personal information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions, such as email and online registration forms. Personal information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, your name, Facebook account, Twitter account, and/or email address. The types and amount of personal information we collect may vary, depending on what information you choose to provide. Some of the ways in which we use this information are to 1) provide our application services, 2) provide you with content relevant to you, 3) offer personalized features, 4) tailor your user experience, 5) allow you to connect to and share information with other users, 6) validate your identity, 7) prevent fraud, and 8) provide customer services including technical support. 

When you allow others to view your profile, send messages, post messages, or otherwise share personal information with other users, we cannot control and are not responsible for the actions of other users in handling the information. Any improper collection or misuse of information is a violation of our Terms of Service and should be reported to privacy@edsurge.com 

**Information on Usage** \- We track the usage of our website and our services on other websites to improve the services we offer to our users. For example, we collect user traffic patterns to help improve site flow and usability. We may use anonymous usage data to define various user types and customize the experience for those user types, including notifying them of particular features made just for them or requesting particular actions beneficial to the overall experience with our applications. 

**Information from other sources** \- We may also collect information about you from other sources, such as from other users of our services (for example, messages sent to you by other users) in order to provide our services, more useful information, and a more personalized experience. 

**Cookies** \- Our services are integrating with Facebook and Twitter, whom may send one or more cookies - a small file containing a string of characters - to your computer. Facebook and Twitter both use cookies to identify if a user is logged in, and to customize the user experience. 

Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some services may not function properly if you have cookies disabled. 

**Use of personal data for research purposes** \- We may partner with education researchers and foundations from time to time who may request records of user interactions on our services. Some requests may be for data such as topics followed, industry function, and other data attached to account information and sometimes we may provide this information with numbers or other identifiers that keep your name anonymous. In all cases we will use our best efforts to ensure that the researchers use appropriate security measures to protect all confidential information we provide to them, and that they use the information we provide for grant-making or other research purposes. 

**Use of aggregate information** \- We also may use your personal information without identifying you as an individual. This type of information is generally collected and analyzed for all users of our website and services to determine the overall, aggregate trends of and statistics about our users, not for the behaviors of individual users. For example, we may aggregate demographic data to help us improve and market the services we offer to users. 

We may disclose this non-personal aggregated user information to prospective partners and other third parties, as well as for other lawful purposes. This non-personal information is used by third parties to help us improve EdSurge's website and services. 

**User communications** \- When you send email or other communication to EdSurge or through our services, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests, and improve our services. 

EdSurge may send you service-related announcements from time to time through the general operation of the service. For instance, when one user takes an action relevant to you, you may be notified about that action through various distribution channels, including email. Generally, you may opt out of such emails through the user settings page, though EdSurge reserves the right to send you notices about your account, business practices, and system operations such as outage notifications, even if you opt out of all voluntary email notifications. 

#### Changing or Removing Information

EdSurge offers users the ability to change privacy and security settings on the information collected by EdSurge. Editing or removing personal data can be done through the user settings page. Users who wish to deactivate their EdSurge account may do so on the user settings page. Removed information may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time, but will not be generally available to users of EdSurge services. 

However, where you make use of the communication features of the service to share information with others (e.g. updating a product page), you sometimes cannot remove such communications. 

#### Children

We do not knowingly request or collect personal information from anyone under the age of 13. EdSurge's website and its services are not intended for or designed to be used by anyone under 13 years of age. If you use our service, you represent that you are 13 years of age or older. 

We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet. 

#### EdSurge Transfer and Information Sharing Policy

We may provide information we receive from you to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf, facilitating our business, and for any other purposes identified above. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. 

EdSurge may share personal information about site users with third parties if doing so is 1) appropriate to carry out a user's request, 2) reasonably necessary to offer the service, 3) reasonably believed to be legally required, or 4) is in EdSurge's interest to protect its property or other legal rights or the rights or property of others. EdSurge also shares non-personal information in anonymous aggregate form with third parties as discussed above. 

#### Links

EdSurge's website or its services on other websites may contain links to non-EdSurge websites, such as to school or company webpages. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site to review the privacy terms of other websites that collect personal information. 

#### Merger, Sale, or Other Change of Control 

If EdSurge should ever file for bankruptcy or have its assets sold to or merge with another entity, information EdSurge received from you through its website or through EdSurge's services on other websites is an EdSurge asset and may be transferred to another entity. 

#### International Visitors and Customers 

This website is hosted in the United States. If you are visiting from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that you are transferring your personal data to the United States which does not have the same data protection laws as the EU and by providing your personal data you consent to: 

  * the use of your personal data for the uses identified above in accordance with this Privacy Policy; and
  * the transfer of your personal data to the United States as indicated above.



#### Security

We use standard practices including secure server layer software (SSL) and firewalls to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software. We are not responsible for the circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures associated with our website or our services offered on other websites. No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure security on our systems.

If EdSurge learns of a security systems breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using this website, or providing personal information to us, you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of this website and EdSurge's services on other websites. EdSurge may post a notice on our website if a security breach occurs, the viewing of which requires a web browser. In these circumstances, EdSurge may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us at privacy@edsurge.com 

#### Changes and Updates

We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we do, we will also revise the "Effective Date" on the Privacy Policy. Non-material changes will take effect immediately. For changes to this Privacy Policy that may be materially less restrictive on our use or disclosure of personal information you have provided to us, we will attempt to notify you when implementing the change. Material changes take effect within 30 days of being posted to the Privacy Policy. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about how we are protecting the Personal Information we collect. Your use of EdSurge's website and EdSurge's services on other websites, as well as your continued use thereof following the posting of changes to the terms, constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any updates.
