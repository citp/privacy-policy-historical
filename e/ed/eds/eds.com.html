            <p><b>Privacy and Data Protection at www.eds.com</b><br>
              In accordance with the EDS Privacy and Web Data Protection Policy, 
              the following discloses our information gathering and dissemination 
              practices for this Web site: </p>
            <p><b><a name="use"></a>Use</b>: The site collects data through a 
              feedback form that allows users to request information about EDS 
              and its products and services. For this purpose we request and collect 
              user's contact information, consisting of name and e-mail address. 
              The form also allows a user to provide other information as he or 
              she may desire to provide such as contact information, resumes, 
              and business alliance related data. Information so collected is 
              used solely for the purpose of responding to the request of the 
              user. Such request may include provision of the EDS newsletter and 
              if so, the user's contact information will be used for mailings 
              of such information by EDS. Users may opt-out of receiving future 
              mailings; see the Opt-Out section below. </p>
            <p>Users may also incidentally submit to EDS other sensitive personal 
              data -- like political opinions, opinions related to specific employees, 
              or open business proposals. Such unsolicited information is considered 
              non-confidential and nonproprietary by our <a href="/administrative/legal.shtml">Terms 
              and Conditions</a> statement.</p>
            <p>The site also provides a capability for users to submit their resumes 
              to EDS via e-mail. Any resume so received by EDS will be held in 
              confidence and used only for the purpose of considering the submitting 
              party for employment or such other purpose as requested by the submitting 
              party. Such information is not shared with third parties unless 
              specifically requested or authorized by the submitting party.</p>
            <p>We may use user IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our 
              server and administer our Web site, to analyze trends, to track 
              user movement and use, and to gather broad demographic information. 
              Such data is not linked to any personally identifiable information. 
            </p>
            <p>Use of the site does not require registration and we do not use 
              cookies (except see 'Site Survey' below). </p>
            <p>Data submitted to the site may be transferred within EDS, including 
              to subsidiaries, strictly in order to fulfill or expedite a user's 
              request. Data submitted to this site will not be shared or sold 
              to any outside parties, unless specifically requested by the user; 
              the only exceptions to this being in response to a court order or 
              other legal obligation. </p>
            <p>eds.com links to other outside Web sites and eds.com is not responsible 
              for the privacy practices of these other sites. Users should check 
              their privacy policies (if available) before submitting any personal 
              information since the privacy practices of these other sites may 
              be different from that of eds.com. In some cases, when a user links 
              to another Web site, the user may still see the EDS logo and template. 
              Any easy way to verify this is by checking the location bar within 
              your browser. Users should be aware that any personal information
