        <dd> 
          <p>The site collects data through a feedback form that allows users
            to request information about EDS and its products and services. For
            this purpose we request and collect user's contact information, consisting
            of first name, last name, position title and e-mail address. The
            form also allows a user to provide such other information as he or
            she may desire to provide. Information so collected is used solely
            for the purpose of responding to the request of the user. Such request
            may include provision of EDS news releases and if so, the user's
            contact information will be used for mailings of such information
            by EDS. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the Opt-Out
            section below. </p> 
          <p>Use of the site may require registration in some areas where EDS
            deems it necessary to track user information. Registration may be
            required for proprietary information, marketing analysis, and/or
            lead generation. All personally identifiable information that is
            collected in the registration process will be housed on a database
            or databases in the United States of America and subject to the applicable
            laws of that country. Use of registrant’s information will
            be used solely for the purposes of supplying marketing related material
            that the registrant has opted-in for in the registration process.
            Registered users will have the option to change permissions and opt-out
            of any and/or all communication. </p> 
          <p>The site also provides a capability for users to submit their resumes
            to EDS via e-mail. Any resume so received by EDS will be held in
            confidence and used only for the purpose of considering the submitting
            party for employment or such other purpose as requested by the submitting
            party. Such information is not shared with third parties unless specifically
            requested or authorized by the submitting party.</p> 
          <p>We may use user IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our
            server and administer our Web site, to analyze trends, to track user
            movement and use, and to gather broad demographic information. Such
            data is not linked to any personally identifiable information. Personal
            information provided by the user may also be collected for the purposes
            of internal marketing research, user trend studies and sitewide improvements.
            Such data will not be shared with third parties and is used solely
            to improve our understanding of our audience.</p> 
          <p>EDS may use cookies for the purpose of improving user experience
            and to facilitate the transfer of data between the site and the individual. </p> 
          <p>Data submitted to the site may be transferred within EDS, including
            to subsidiaries and approved third parties strictly in order to fulfill
            or expedite a user's request. Data submitted to this site will not
            be shared or sold to any other outside parties, unless specifically
            requested by the user.</p>

            it is needed to fulfill a user’s request, maintain records
            of interaction with users, and/or to facilitate and support the use

        <dd> 
          <p>Periodically, the eds.com team will collect non-personally identifiable
            information from people who visit the site. We do this by using cookies – a
            small piece of data that our site sends to a person's computer where
            it is stored. For example, eds.com might use a cookie to identify
            a person interested in an industry and the next time that person
            visits the site the previously viewed industry will automatically
            populate the screen.</p> 
          <p>The cookies that eds.com uses are strictly for improving overall
            user experience and site performance. If people do not want to accept
            cookies, they can disable them by working with their settings in
            their browsers.</p>

        <dd> 
          <p>Eds.com will periodically use beacons or spotlight tags in their
            Web page and newsletters to gather metrics in their aggregate form.
            A beacon is usually an electronic image called a clear GIF or a 1x1
            GIF. These files look for specific non-personally identifiable information
            on a person’s computer. This information includes browser information,
            cookie number, page views and any other basic data that we can use
            to improve messaging and usability on eds.com.</p> 
          <p>EDS does not allow for third-party ads on their Web site but we
            do occasionally contract with advertising companies that place ads
            on behalf of EDS. The advertising company may use beacons for campaign
            success measurements.</p> 
          <p>Beacons used by EDS collect data that is anonymous, is not linked
            to personally identifiable information nor attached to any databases.</p> 
          <p>Individuals can prevent the use of beacon and/or cookies by disabling
            them in the security settings of the Internet browsers.</p>

            survey carried out by an independent organization. You may opt-out
            of participation at the time the survey is offered. The survey collects
            generalized statistics only. No personal data is held as a result
            of the site survey, unless you opt to provide specific comments.
            In this case your comments and address information will be passed

            as provided for information collected on the eds.com Web site. Contact
