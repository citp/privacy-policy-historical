<p><b><a id="What types of information are collected through this site or mobile application?">What types of information are collected through this site or mobile application?</a></b></p>

<p>We may collect a range of information from you if you visit our site or mobile application depending upon the features you use.</p>

<p>We may collect personal information, such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card numbers, Social Security numbers or other identifiers that you may provide in the course of completing a form or transaction on our site or mobile application.  Portions of our site may collect additional information from individuals using those features such as accepting resumes from job applicants or collecting application of financial aid information from students and applicants.</p>  

<p>We may collect information about the browser and/or device that you are using to access our website or mobile application (such as the type of browser or device you are using, browser settings, and the device identification number). Device information may or may not be personally identifiable depending upon whether it is linked to the identity of the user.</p> 

<p>We may automatically log information, such as a user's IP address, domain name, browser type, date and time of access, and other log file data.  This information may be used to analyze trends or administer our websites and mobile applications.  We may collect statistical or non-personally-identifiable information about our users, such as which pages are visited, how long a visitor stays on a particular page, the website from which a user came to our site, or similar such information.  We also may collect aggregate information such as the total number of unique or return visitors to our site, using our application, or visiting a particular page in a given timeframe. We may use this information to measure the use of our sites and applications and to improve our content.  We may use Google Analytics, a third party provider of analytics tools or a similar third party service to analyze information about visits to our website.  For information about opting out of Google Analytics please visit: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.</p>

<p><b><a id="Does your website use cookies or similar technologies?">Does your website use cookies or similar technologies?</a></b></p>

<p>Yes, we may utilize "cookies," web beacons and other similar technologies on our website. We may use first and/or third party "browser" or "HTTP" cookies, which are unique text files that may be used for data analysis, and enable our website to tailor information for the visitor. We may use browser cookies for purposes such as to personalize the user's experience on our site, to remember a user when the user registers for products or services, for fraud prevention, or to track visits to our websites. We also may use "web beacons" (also referred to as pixel tags, clear gifs or other terms) or similar technologies to collect information such as how long a visitor remains on a particular page.  If you do not want us to deploy browser cookies to your device when you visit our websites, you may set the browser to reject cookies or to notify the user when a web site tries to place cookies in the browser program (see below). Rejecting cookies may affect your ability to use some of features offered by the website. If you use our website without setting your browser to block cookies, you consent to the placement of cookies on your device.</p>

<p>Third parties, including our service providers or marketing partners may collect information about a visitor to our site over time and/or across different websites when the visitor uses our website.  This information often is aggregate data or individual information that is tied to a browser or device rather than specific identifiers such as the visitor's name and address, but some of this information might be considered to be personally identifiable under some federal or state laws.</p>

<p><b><a id="What choices do I have about online tracking and the placement of cookies on my device?">What choices do I have about online tracking and the placement of cookies on my device?</a></b></p>

<p>Some Internet browsers have begun to offer what often is referred to as "do not track" mechanisms for browser users to automatically signal privacy preferences to websites that they visit.  Internet browsers have only begun to include these features relatively recently and there is not yet a consensus about what steps a website should take when it receives a do-not-track signal from a site visitor's browser or what information collection or use restrictions should be applied when a do-not-track signal is received.  As a result, our site(s) do not currently respond to do-not-track-signals.  We are continuing to monitor do not track developments and may revisit the issue in the future.  In the meantime, you can exercise other choices available to you, including limiting the placement of browser cookies on your device using your browser's cookie control features and other choices described in this Policy.</p>
