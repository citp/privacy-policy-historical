# Edmunds Privacy Statement

**Privacy Statement**

We gather certain types of information about the visitors to this Web site and those visitors who use its services, and we believe our visitors should fully understand how we obtain and use that information. This Privacy Statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it. Any comments or questions about this Privacy Statement or our privacy policies should be directed to us though our [Contact Us](http://help.edmunds.com/cgi-bin/edmunds.cfg/php/enduser/ask.php) form.

**Your Personally Identifiable Information**

The submission by you to Edmunds.com of personally identifiable information (e.g., your name, your address, your e-mail address, your telephone number) may be required in order for you to receive certain services, products or information you request from either Edmunds.com or other companies with which we do business — and some personally identifiable information is required in order to sign up for a [My Edmunds account](https://web.archive.org/apps/dcm/FullLogin.jsp). This personally identifiable information may be shared between Edmunds.com and those companies, and may also be disclosed to other entities who work with Edmunds.com or those companies to fulfill your request. **Edmunds cannot control, and is not responsible for, the manner in which any of such partners and other companies use such information.**

If you give your consent, this information also may be shared with other entities to help us improve our services or to notify you about other products and services. That is, you may receive information from us or from other companies by e-mail, U.S. mail or other means. However, if we do not have your express consent, our policy is to not provide your personally identifiable information to anyone else, except as provided below. Edmunds.com may disclose personally identifying information, without first notifying you or obtaining your consent, upon receipt of legal process seeking such information, or if Edmunds.com determines that disclosure of such information: (i) is or may be required by law; (ii) is or may be reasonably necessary to enforce the Edmunds.com Membership Agreement (see "Edmunds.com" below) or our [Visitor Agreement](https://web.archive.org/help/about/visitoragreement.html), or to take appropriate action if a visitor is determined by Edmunds.com to have violated either of those agreements; or (iii) is or may be reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of Edmunds.com, its visitors or other individuals or entities. Edmunds.com may also disclose to third parties, when it determines such disclosure to be appropriate under the circumstances, portions of this Web site’s log files that show which “Internet service provider” a visitor used when on this Web site. That information may enable third parties to discover, through that Internet service provider, the identity of a visitor.

In certain locations on this Web site in which we obtain personally identifiable information from you, we may include “check boxes” for the purpose of soliciting your consent to receive special offers and other information from Edmunds.com and other entities selected by us. By leaving these check boxes “checked,” you are choosing to receive commercial e-mail communications from Edmunds.com and/or those other entities. In that event, you will have the opportunity at any time to “opt-out” of receiving future commercial e-mails from Edmunds.com (on behalf of itself and/or such third parties) either by modifying your My Edmunds account or by following the instructions located at the bottom of the e-mail we send you. (However, please note that opting-out in this manner will not affect the right of such other entities to send e-mails to you independently of Edmunds.com.) 

**Your Zip Code**

Edmunds.com requests your Zip Code in a number of locations on this Web site, including when you first engage in vehicle research. Providing us your Zip Code enables us to display to you vehicle selling prices adjusted for your region, incentive and rebates that apply in your region, your vehicle's five-year True Cost to Ownsm for your region, and dealer listings specific to your region. Edmunds.com provides this information for Zip Codes that are within one of the 50 states or the District of Columbia, but not those in other U.S. territories or possessions or for the postal codes of Canada or other countries.

When you first provide your Zip Code to us, whether through the use of one of our applications (such as the Edmunds.com True Market Value® tools or Dealer Locator), or in response to a direct request by us that you provide your Zip Code, Edmunds.com serves a “cookie” to you that includes your Zip Code. (“Cookies” are described below.) That cookie permits us to recognize your Zip Code when you use other applications, or upon your return to this Web site, without our having to ask you again for your Zip Code. 

You have the opportunity to change your Zip Code at appropriate times during your visit to this Web site if you want to get information for a different Zip Code; changing your Zip Code in any application automatically updates your Zip Code cookie. 

**Other Cookies**

"Cookies" are small data files that many Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file contains information such as a user ID that a site may use to track the pages you've visited. However, the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. Cookies served by Edmunds.com don’t permit Edmunds.com to read data from your hard drive or read cookie files created by other Web sites.

Edmunds.com uses cookies in many ways, including the following:

First Visits: When you first visited this Web site, Edmunds.com served a cookie to you. This cookie resides permanently on your hard drive (unless you chose to delete it) and enables us to track visitor activity across this Web site.

Applications: Whenever you use an application on this Web site, such as those listed above, Edmunds.com may serve a "session cookie" to you, which is a cookie that is only used by us during your use of that application. In addition, for some applications we may serve a cookie to you that has a longer expiration date. These cookies help us manage our delivery to you of application information and related content.

Lead Forms: In certain applications, such as Dealer Locator, you may be presented with a form that requests, among other items, your name and contact information. When this form is submitted by you the information you provide is stored on our computers, so that we have a record of what we have sent to our partners. We also serve a cookie to you that encodes where on our computers that information is maintained, so that we can "pre-fill" your name and contact information for you when in the future you call up a similar form. You may opt to not have this cookie served to you by deselecting this feature at the bottom of the form.

My Edmunds Registration: When you sign up for a My Edmunds account, Edmunds.com uses a cookie to store your registration information on your computer if you click the “Remember me” box. We use this cookie to enable you to enter this Web site as a member without having to sign in each time.

Newsletters: Edmunds.com uses cookies in connection with the delivery of its newsletters. This allows us to measure and report the click-through rate for the links within the newsletters and then better determine future content. See "Electronic Newsletters" below.

Advertisements: Edmunds.com's advertising system delivers cookies in order to track ad impressions and click rates. See "Third-Party Ad Servers" below. 

**Edmunds.com Forums**

In order to post a message in the message boards that are a part of [Edmunds.com Forums](http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/ForumsLanding), you must both have a My Edmunds account and have selected a username for use in the Forums. You do not need to register in order to browse or read other members' posts.

_Membership Agreement_

If you register as a member of Edmunds.com Forums, you are subject to the [Forums Membership Agreement.](http://www.edmunds.com/townhall/memberagreement.html).

_Information Sharing and Disclosure Practices_

  * When you post a message in the Forums, your ”username” is visible to other visitors. Your username is linked to your member profile, which others may view. You may elect to make the information included in your member profile, such as your e-mail address, public to other members, or you may elect to keep that information private.
  * When you post a message in the Forums, you have the ability to include personally identifiable information about yourself. If you do so, you may receive unsolicited messages from other individuals or entities. 
  * Edmunds.com maintains the privacy of personal information provided by members of the Forums. However, Edmunds.com may disclose personally identifiable information under special circumstances, as described above under " **Your Personally Identifiable Information**." In addition, Edmunds.com may share with third parties the postings in the Forums as well as non-personal, or summary, information concerning members and their activities.
  * Members of Edmunds.com Forums will not be placed on any mailing lists except with their express consent. However, Edmunds.com reserves the right to contact members using their e-mail address regarding our community policies or other matters that Edmunds.com believes are of general interest to the membership.

_Revision and Deletion of Postings_

After you post a message, you have 30 minutes to make any changes or delete your message entirely. After 30 minutes, only the Host of the discussion can delete your post. Edmunds.com does not edit any member messages. You may contact the Host by clicking on his or her username, which can be found at the top of each discussion under the discussion’s title. 

**Electronic Newsletters**

Edmunds.com offers free electronic newsletters that are dispatched by e-mail. Edmunds.com gathers the e-mail addresses of individuals who voluntarily subscribe, as well as demographic information from optional survey questions (see "Surveys" below). Individuals may subscribe, and subscribers may remove themselves from one or more of our mailing lists, through the [Newsletters Page](https://web.archive.org/nlrg/secure/newsletter.do). (Please note that in order to access this page you must first have a [My Edmunds account](https://web.archive.org/apps/dcm/FullLogin.jsp).)

Edmunds.com delivers newsletters, and marketing and product offerings promoted in newsletters, by e-mail only to registered recipients. The e-mail tracking system recognizes the URL that was clicked, and records some information about you and your computer, such as the e-mail address that you provided to us, the browser, operating system and IP address.

While aggregate counts of click-through behavior are provided to advertisers within our newsletters, an advertiser will never know that a specific visitor clicked their ad. Edmunds.com may target advertising according to the optional demographic information you provide at the time of subscription to the Newsletter. However, Edmunds.com will not provide specific visitor information to any third party unless you have given your explicit permission when you signed up for your My Edmunds account. 

**Surveys**

Occasionally Edmunds.com conducts visitor surveys to better target our content to our audience or for the benefit of third parties with whom we do business. Accordingly, sometimes the aggregate survey results are shared with our advertisers and partners. We never share any survey information about specific visitor with any third party unless that visitor expressly consents.

**New Vehicle PowerShopper, Dealer Locator Service and Vehicle InfoPak Services**

Edmunds.com's New Vehicle PowerShopper service may collect personally identifiable information about you, depending on which of our partners you select, and Edmunds.com's Dealer Locator service does collect personally identifiable information about you if you chose to have one or more dealers contact you. You will also be providing personally identifiable information if you purchase an Edmunds.com Vehicle InfoPak or any other Edmunds.com service or product for which we charge a fee. The use of the information obtained by us through your use of these services and purchase of these products is described in other portions of this Privacy Statement.

**Edmunds.com's TMV ® Finance Rate Estimator**

Edmunds.com's TMV® Finance Rate Estimator (the "Estimator") provides you with national average loan rates currently being offered by banks for new and used vehicles; requests specific information concerning your credit history and Zip Code; and then, based on that information, provides you with both (i) the local average loan rates currently being offered for new and used vehicles by lending institutions in your market, and (ii) our estimate of which "credit tier" you will qualify for when you apply for financing.

Edmunds.com does not collect personally identifying information of any kind when you use the Estimator, nor does Edmunds.com record or store any of the information you provide when using the Estimator. As a result, you can use the Estimator with confidence that neither Edmunds.com nor any other person or entity will know the answers you give or the results generated for you by the Estimator.

Edmunds.com may include in the Estimator links to partners, and the partners that are presented to you may depend on which credit tier you have been placed in by the Estimator and/or the Zip Code you provide. As a result, a partner may be aware that individuals who are referred from the Estimator have, based on the information they provided to the Estimator, been placed by Edmunds.com in a particular tier or are located in a particular area. However, that partner will not know your identity or the answers you give to any of the questions in the Estimator (other than your Zip Code) unless you chose to separately provide information about yourself to that partner. Partners will not make any determination to offer or deny you credit or any other product or service other than on the basis of information you separately provide to such partner. Edmunds.com has no control over the privacy practices or information that partner sites may request of you. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these sites. 

**Visitor-Submitted Content**

Edmunds.com provides a number of means by which you may communicate with other visitors and with Edmunds.com. This includes the Edmunds.com Forums, Consumer Ratings and Reviews, Letters to the Editors, Success Stories, Edmunds.com Help and the submittal to us of a general question or comment. All of your communications made through this Web site or submitted to us for that or any other purpose are referred to as your "Visitor-Submitted Content."

For information concerning our use of your Visitor-Submitted Content, please see our [Visitor Agreement](https://web.archive.org/help/about/visitoragreement.html). 

**E-mail this Page to a Friend**

Many of the pages of this Web site include a feature that permits visitors to electronically forward that page to someone else by clicking on a link. The sender must provide his or her e-mail address, as well as that of the recipient. The sender's information is used only in the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient know who sent the page. Neither the sender's information nor the recipient's information is used for any other purpose.

**Third-Party Ad Servers**

We use DoubleClick Inc., a third-party advertising company, to serve advertisements for this Web site. DoubleClick may use information (not including your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about your visits to Edmunds.com and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. Use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by DoubleClick, [view DoubleClick's privacy policy](http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/).

**Changes to this Privacy Statement**

Edmunds.com reserves the right to change this Privacy Statement at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of this Web site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes. Information collected prior to the time any change is posted will be used according to the rules and laws that applied at the time the information was collected.
