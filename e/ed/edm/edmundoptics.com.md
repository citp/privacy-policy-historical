# Edmund Optics: Privacy Policy

**Privacy Policy**

Edmund Industrial Optics, a subsidiary of Edmund Optics, Inc., recognizes the importance of your privacy. To ensure that your needs with regard to this are being met, please take a few moments to familiarize yourself with our policy. 

**B2B**

First, Edmund Industrial Optics is a business-to-business site and is not oriented to the consumer market. As a result, we do not compile, buy, sell, rent or trade consumer mailing lists. Nor do we compile, buy, sell, rent or trade personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union membership, and the processing of data concerning health or sex life. All marketing efforts we undertake are targeted toward a business audience only. Additionally, we neither collect - nor do we want - private information from minors. With that said, the safety of children is very important to us. Children (under age 16) should always ask parents for permission before sending personal information to us, or to anyone else online for that matter. 

**Information Collected by Edmund Industrial Optics**

Edmund Industrial Optics collects information about users during their initial visit to our site, during registration, and while participating in certain activities. Furthermore, we collect the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail. Plus, we do collect aggregate information on which pages our customers access or visit. By "aggregate" we mean that the information is not specific enough to identify any individual user. Our cookies are designed to retain ordering information for customer convenience, to avoid re-keying data. This cookie resides on your hard drive and can be deleted by you at anytime. Additionally, we collect information that customers volunteer to us through our site-registration form and surveys. 

It is important to note that our servers are not programmed to recognize the domain or e-mail addresses of those who visit our site. We do not utilize a third-party ad-server. 

**What We Do With the Information We Gather**

The primary use of the information is to improve our ability to meet your needs. We analyze the information to improve the content of our web site and to determine whether to add or subtract products or services from our catalog. 

We also use the information to contact our customers to apprise them of new products or services that may be of interest, promotional activities and marketing surveys. 

Customers who supply us with their mailing address or telephone number, may be contacted to confirm or reference online or print catalog orders. At times, this information may also be used as part of our ongoing marketing efforts. 

Edmund Industrial Optics may, from time to time, share our customer lists with other reputable organizations that may use the information for marketing purposes. We do not, however, share our e-mail lists. 

We also will disclose information concerning you when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, or to protect the rights or property of Edmund Industrial Optics. 

**Opt-Out Policies**

If you do not want to receive e-mail, postal mailings or telephone calls from Edmund Industrial Optics in the future, please let us know by sending us an e-mail or writing us. Please specify what type of communication you don't want to receive and we will be sure to remove your name from our marketing list and those we share with others from the date we process your notice.

Our site does not provide a means for you to access the information we maintain on you online. If you have reason to believe we have incorrect data, or merely want to review what we have, please contact us as above. 

**Security**

We use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving payment data exchanged with our site. We have security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our site. 

**Links**

We are not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of Web sites to which we may provide links or the Web sites of our advertisers. Posting of a link on our site does not constitute an endorsement of that site for any purpose. 

**Change in Policy**

If our information practices change in the future, we will use only data collected from the time of the policy change forward for these new purposes, or we will contact you before we use your data for these new purposes and offer you with the ability to opt out of these new uses. We will post such changes to our Web site. We invite you to check our site periodically.
