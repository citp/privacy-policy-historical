Government of Nova Scotia websites are covered by the [Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act.](http://www.gov.ns.ca/legislature/legc/statutes/freedom.htm) Our privacy policy arises from that Act, other legislation, and fair information practices. 

### What it means

On our websites, we collect personal information about you only when you explicitly provide it. Examples of that collection would be when you renew your vehicle registration, apply for a marriage certificate online, or request tourist information to be mailed to you. We protect the personal information given to us when you fill out a form. We have implemented a variety of security measures to ensure that your personal information is not lost, misused, altered, or unintentionally destroyed. 

### What do we mean by personal information?

By "personal information" we mean any information about you as an identifiable individual including your name, an identifying number such as your driver's licence number, your birth date, your email address, or your credit card information.

### What we might do
