Cookies

A cookie is a small file that a web server automatically sends to your computer when you browse certain web sites. Cookies are stored as text files on your hard drive and contain information that identifies a user, for example: login or username, passwords, shopping cart information, preferences, and so on. When a user revisits a web site, his or her computer automatically "serves up" the cookie, which establishes the user's identity, thus eliminating the need for the customer to reenter the information. Cookie technology also makes shopping cart technology possible. For example, when you select items that you intend to purchase in an online catalog, cookies make it possible for you to continue shopping and to "check-out" later.
