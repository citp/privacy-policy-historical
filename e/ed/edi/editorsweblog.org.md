This includes information such as your real name, address, telephone number and date of birth. Information which cannot be directly linked to your real identity - such as favourite websites or number of users of a site - is not considered personal data.

### Collection and processing of personal data

In normal cases, you can visit all publically accessible WAN-IFRA websites without providing any personal details.When you visit our web pages, our web servers always temporarily save for security purposes the connection data of the computer connecting to our site, a list of the web pages that you visit within our site, the date of your visit, the identification data of the type of browser and operation system used as well as the website through which you linked to our site. Personal information such as your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address is not collected unless you provide this data voluntarily, e.g. as part of a registration for an event, competition, survey, fulfilment of a contract, or an information request.

### Utilisation and sharing of personal data

WAN-IFRA consists of the headquarters operation in Darmstadt (Germany), a headquarters extension in Paris (France) as well as subsidiaries outside of the EU in Singapore and Mumbai (India). The data recorded by the local WAN-IFRA regional offices is stored and managed on central database servers at the headquarters in Darmstadt. However, the subsequent processing steps may be carried out at the individual WAN-IFRA offices worldwide as required.

When the regional offices access personal data stored on the central server in Darmstadt, it is considered a transfer to 3rd parties. In the case of France, this is done in accordance with the laws and directives of the EU as well as the complementary local regulations. Although outside of the European Union, the offices in Singapore and India have been bound by directive to abide by the EU data protection laws.

WAN-IFRA does not share, sell, transfer or otherwise disseminate your personal data to other third parties, unless this is required for the purpose of the contract, is required by law or you have given express consent to do so. For instance, it may be necessary to pass on your address and order data to our contractors when you order products or services.
