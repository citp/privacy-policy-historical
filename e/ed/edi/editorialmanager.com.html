2. Collection of Personal Information.</b> There are two primary methods through which we may collect personal

information from you. The first method is in connection with the establishment

of your User Account. The specific personally identifiable information that we

collect in connection with the account registration process (“Registration

Information”) may vary depending on the specific requirements of the Publisher

or the Publication, but typically always includes your name, e-mail address, and

the name of the institution or association with which you are affiliated. During

the registration process, we may also collect other information from which your

identity is discernible , such as your address and telephone number. <br>The

second method is when you make personally identifiable information available

while using the Website, the Software or the Services (“User Information”). You

may make User Information available in connection with the submission, editing,

and/or review of a Manuscript, and/or the uploading, submission, or transmission

of other User Submissions. For example, if you are an Author and elect to submit

a Manuscript, you have the option of providing additional information that you

believe may be of interest to the Publisher or the Publication, such as your

age, gender, race, life or professional experiences, and academic or

professional qualifications. Alternatively, a Publisher or Publication may

request that you provide certain information in connection with the submission

of a Manuscript, including information such as your age, gender, race, protected

status, life or professional experiences, and academic or professional

qualifications. <br>While User Information may assist in the review and

publication process, you are under no obligation to provide any User

Information. If you do provide User Information, you are thereby consenting to

the use and disclosure of such User Information in accordance with the terms and

conditions of the Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy. Aries Systems does not

monitor the nature of User Information that may be requested by the Publisher or

the Publication or User Information that is submitted or provided by User, and

does not represent or warrant that such User Information may be requested or

provided under applicable law. As such, we encourage you to carefully consider

whether to provide any User Information, and to raise any questions or concerns

that you may have relating to a request for Personal Information directly with

the Publisher or the Publication making such request. <br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="our"></a><b>3. Our Use and Sharing of Your Personal Information.</b>

Aries Systems does not claim ownership of any of your Registration Information or

User Information (collectively, “Personal Information”). Aries Systems collects and

stores Personal Information on its servers and computer networks solely on

behalf of the Publisher and/or the Publication. All Personal Information is

owned by the Publisher and/or the Publication and may be accessed by the

Publisher or the Publication at any time. At the request of the Publisher or the

Publication, Aries Systems will disclose your Personal Information to the Publisher

or the Publication. <b>THIS PRIVACY POLICY DOES NOT DESCRIBE OR GOVERN HOW THE

PUBLISHER OR THE PUBLICATION MAY USE OR DISCLOSE ANY OF YOUR PERSONAL

business partners and agents, such as financial institutions, suppliers,

maintenance and support of the Website, the Software, and/or the Services, in

which case we will request that such third parties maintain the confidentiality

of your Personal Information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy

Policy; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to comply

with any legal requirements or court orders, to defend any legal or

individual’s personal safety in an emergency situation;

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) to protect or defend
