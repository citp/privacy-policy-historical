###  Use of Cookies 

The Edifier USA Web site use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. 

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Edifier USA pages, or register with Edifier USA site or services, a cookie helps Edifier USA to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Edifier USA Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Edifier USA features that you customized. 

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Edifier USA services or Web sites you visit. 

###  Security of your Personal Information 

Edifier USA secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Edifier USA secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. 

###  Changes to this Statement 

Edifier USA will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect company and customer feedback. Edifier USA encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how Edifier USA is protecting your information.
