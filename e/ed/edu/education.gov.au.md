The Department of Education and Training, its employees, contractors and agents (collectively, the department) is subject to the [_Privacy Act 1988_ ](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A03712)(the Privacy Act) and to the requirements of the [Australian Privacy Principles](https://www.oaic.gov.au/individuals/privacy-fact-sheets/general/privacy-fact-sheet-17-australian-privacy-principles) (APPs) contained in the Privacy Act.

We also adhere to the [Guidelines for Federal and ACT Government Websites](https://www.oaic.gov.au/agencies-and-organisations/guides/), issued by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner.

Our **privacy policy** has been developed in accordance with APP 1 and embodies our commitment to protecting personal information. The complete privacy policy can be found here:

## Information we collect and why we use it

We are responsible for national policies and programs that help Australians access quality and affordable childcare; early childhood education; school education; post-school, higher education; international education and academic research, through:

  * efficient national program management;
  * effective working relationships with state and territory governments, non-government education authorities and providers, universities and other providers of community groups and other stakeholders;

  * policy advice and other support to the Minister.



Generally, we collect personal information in order to properly and efficiently carry out one or more of our functions. We only use personal information for the purpose(s) for which it was given to us and for directly related purposes (unless otherwise required or authorised by or under law); as consented to by you or if a permitted general situation exists.

## Tax File Numbers

A tax file number (TFN) is a unique identifier issued by the Commissioner of Taxation.  The department collects Tax File Numbers (TFN) for the following purposes:

  * to administer the Higher Education Loan Programs and Trade Support Loans
  * to make payments of salaries and wages to eligible employee types and contractors.



The Taxation Administration Act 1953 prohibits under law the collection, recording, use and disclosure of TFN information except in limited circumstances (sections 8WA and 8WB).  Unauthorised acts and practices relating to TFN information can result in penalties of up to 100 penalty units and imprisonment for 2 years.

Further information regarding the collection of TFNs can be found at [Office of the Australian Information Commissioner ](http://oaic.gov.au/privacy-law/privacy-act/tax-file-numbers)

## Privacy Notices

In addition to our **privacy policy** , we may need to explain specific privacy practices in more detail at other times. In such circumstances we develop and provide separate privacy notices to describe how we will handle the personal information that we collect. For example, where we ask you to provide personal information in relation to a particular program that we administer, we will provide you with a privacy notice at the time of collection or as soon as practicable afterwards, which details our personal information handling practices in relation to that particular program.

## Personal Information Holdings

We maintain, on an ongoing basis, a Personal Information Holdings document that explains the various types of personal information we collect and hold, what the information is used for and the third parties to whom the information is normally disclosed. Where applicable, the document also details where we are authorised to collect, use or disclose information under legislation relevant to our policies, programs and services.  A copy of the Personal Information Holdings document can be obtained from the Privacy Contact Officer whose details are below.
