## Department of Education

The Department of Education, its employees, contractors and agents (collectively, the department) is subject to the [_Privacy Act 1988_](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A03712)(the Privacy Act) and to the requirements of the [Australian Privacy Principles](https://www.oaic.gov.au/individuals/privacy-fact-sheets/general/privacy-fact-sheet-17-australian-privacy-principles) (APPs) contained in the Privacy Act.

## Information we collect and why we hold, use and disclose it

We are responsible for national policies and programs that help Australians access quality and affordable childcare; early childhood education; school education; post-school, higher education; international education and academic research.

We collect, hold, use and disclose personal information for a variety of purposes, including:

  * performing our management, employment and personnel functions in relation to our staff and contractors;
  * performing our legislative and administrative functions;
  * policy development, research and evaluation;
  * data sharing or data integration with other Australian Government agencies, including but not limited to, data sharing or data integration with the Australian Bureau of Statistics for the Multi-Agency Data Integration Project and the Data Integration Partnership for Australia; 
  * complaints handling;
  * administering requests received by us under the _Freedom of Information Act 1982_ (Cth);
  * preventing, detecting, investigating or dealing with fraud or corruption against the Commonwealth;
  * program management;
  * maintaining effective working relationships with state and territory governments, non-government education authorities and providers, universities and other relevant stakeholders;
  * policy advice and other support to our Ministers;
  * contract management; and
  * management of correspondence with the public.



We only collect, hold, use and disclose personal information for a lawful purpose that is reasonably necessary or directly related to one or more of our functions or activities or where otherwise required or authorised by law.

We will only use your personal information for secondary purposes where we are able to do so in accordance with the Privacy Act.

Tax File Numbers

The following information is provided to comply with the department's obligation under subrule 14(1) of the _Privacy (Tax File Number) Rule 2015_ (TFN Rule).

## Purpose of collection

A tax file number (TFN) is a unique identifier issued by the Commissioner of Taxation. The department may collect TFNs for the following purposes:

  * to administer the Higher Education Loan Programs;;
  * to make payments of salaries and wages to eligible employees and contractors;
  * to administer child care financial assistance payments.



You are not legally obliged to quote your TFN but there may be financial consequences where you chose not to quote it. 

## Prohibitions and penalties

Certain Commonwealth legislation prohibits the collection, recording, use and disclosure of TFN information. Relevantly:

  * the TFN Rule and the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ (Cth) (TAA) contain prohibitions on:


  * requiring, requesting or collecting TFN information for unauthorised purposes (TFN subrule 8(1) and subsection 8WA(1) of the TAA), and
  * recording, using or disclosing TFN information unless permitted under taxation, personal assistance or superannuation law (TFN Rules 9 and 10; and subsection 8WB(1) of the TAA).



A breach of the TFN Rule is an interference with privacy under the Privacy Act. Individuals who consider that their TFN information has been mishandled may make a complaint to the Australian Information Commissioner. Where the breach of privacy is very serious, the Australian Information Commissioner may seek a civil penalty.

A breach of either sections 8WA and 8WB of the TAA is punishable by a fine of 100 penalty units or 2 years imprisonment or both. _NOTE: Effective from 1 July 2017, 1 penalty unit is equal to $210. This unit value will automatically increase in line with the consumer price index from 1 July 2020 and every three years after._

  * The _A New Tax System (Family Assistance)(Administration) Act 1999_ (the Family Assistance Administration Act) and _Child Care Act 1972_ (the Child Care Act) are both personal assistance laws within the definition contained in TFN subrule 6(2). These Acts contain prohibitions on the making of a record, disclosure, use, solicitation or supply of information that is protected information – which includes TFNs (sections 163 – 167 of the Family Assistance Administration Act and sections 12K, 12L, 12M, 12Q, 12R and 12S of the Child Care Act). These offences are punishable by two years imprisonment. There are exceptions permitting the collection, use or disclosure of protected information in limited circumstances, as outlined under Part 6 of the Family Assistance Administration Act, and Part IIIA of the Child Care Act.  
 
  * The _Higher Education Support Act 2003_ (HESA) is a taxation law within the definition contained in TFN subrule 6(2). In collecting, recording, using and disclosing tax file numbers under HESA the department, the Australian Taxation Office, higher education providers and vocational education and training providers must not contravene sections 8WA and 8WB of the TAA.



## Further information

If you would like further information about protections surrounding tax file numbers you may wish to consult:

  * The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner's website (<https://oaic.gov.au/privacy-law/privacy-act/tax-file-numbers>). 
  * The TFN Rule which regulates the collection, storage, use, disclosure, security and disposal of individuals' TFN information. The TFN Rule is available on the Federal Register of Legislation website (<https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2015L00249>).
  * Annex A in the department's Complete Privacy Policy.



## Privacy Notices

In addition to our privacy policy, we may need to explain specific privacy practices in more detail at other times. In such circumstances we develop and provide separate privacy notices to describe how we will handle the personal information that we collect. For example, where we ask you to provide personal information in relation to a particular program that we administer, we will provide you with a privacy notice at the time of collection or as soon as practicable afterwards, which details our personal information handling practices in relation to that particular program.

## Electronic Communication

There are inherent risks associated with the transmission of information over the internet, including via email. You should be aware of this when sending personal information to us via email or via our website or social media platforms. If this is of concern to you then you may use other methods of communication with us, such as post, fax or telephone (although these also have risks associated with them).

The [_Privacy (Australian Government Agencies - Governance) APP Code 2017_](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/F2017L01396)(Privacy Code) requires us to undertake a PIA in certain instances and to maintain a register of those PIAs from 1 July 2018.
