### Security of Information

You should be aware that there are inherent risks associated with the transfer of information via the Internet. For those who do not wish to use the Internet, there are alternative ways of providing information. For example, forms may be printed and lodged by post. To improve security of personal information, some electronic forms that collect this information may collect using the HTTPS protocol (Hypertext Transport Protocol Secure), a standard Web Communications protocol that encrypts and decrypts a message for online transmission. You should check with the site. 

### The Data We Collect – Emails and Electronic Forms

We will record your email address only if you send us a message. Your personal information will only be used for the purposes for which you have provided it. Your email address will not be added to a mailing list, unless you have provided it to us in order to subscribe to one of our subscription services. Where you choose to send us a completed electronic form that includes your personal details, we do collect personally identifiable information, such as name, address and email address. The information collected by email or electronic forms will be used only for the purpose for which you have provided it, and we will not disclose it without your consent, except where authorised or required by law. 

### Publishing Personal Information

We will only publish personal information on this site if it has been collected for this purpose with your knowledge or if you have consented to the disclosure. When giving such consent, you should be aware that information published on this site is accessible to millions of users from all over the world, that search engines will index it, and that it may be copied and used by any web user. This means that once the information is published on this site, we will have no control over its subsequent use and disclosure.
