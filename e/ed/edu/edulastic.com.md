### Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

We are in compliance with the requirements of Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). COPPA requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13. Therefore, we only collect personal information through the Services from a child under 13 where that student’s school, district, and/or teacher has agreed (via the terms described in the following paragraph) to obtain parental consent for that child to use the Services and disclose personal information to us, for the use and benefit of the learning environment. If you are a student under 13, please do not send any personal information about yourself to us if your school, district, and/or teacher has not obtained this prior consent from your parent or guardian, and please do not send any personal information other than what we request from you in connection with the Services. If we learn we have collected personal information from a student under 13 without parental consent being obtained by his or her school, district, and/or teacher, or if we learn a student under 13 has provided us personal information beyond what we request from him or her, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a student under 13 may have provided us personal information in violation of this paragraph, please contact us at [support@edulastic.com](mailto:support@edulastic.com)

If you are a school, district, or teacher, you represent and warrant that you are solely responsible for complying with COPPA, meaning that you must obtain advance written consent from all parents or guardians whose children under 13 will be accessing the Services. You are responsible for understanding how any Publisher Software (defined and described below) that you install on behalf of yourself or other users may collect and use information of users of Edulastic’s Services. When obtaining consent, you must provide parents and guardians with our [Privacy Policy](http://edulastic.com/privacy-policy).

You must keep all consents on file and provide them to us if we request them. For more information on COPPA, please[ click here](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule).
