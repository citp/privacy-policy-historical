# Terms and Conditions of Use

The following paragraphs summarize Houghton Mifflin's policy regarding the collection and use of personal information about children. 

_Types of personal information collected:_ Under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, "personal information" is defined as individually identifiable information such as a first and last name, a home or other physical address including street name and city or town, an e-mail address, a telephone number, a Social Security number, or persistent identifiers such as customer or processor serial numbers held in a cookie, where the identifier is associated with individually identifiable information. Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored in a designated file on a user's computer. Houghton Mifflin usually does not collect personal information, as defined under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. We collect and use only as much information about children as necessary for the activity, and do not condition participation in any on-line activity on the disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary. Occasionally, we use cookies to store pertinent user information during a session. 

_Use of personal information:_ We use the information we collect from children only for internal business purposes, and/or to give credit to children for work they have created. We contact children by e-mail only in response to their requests for information or assistance. Houghton Mifflin uses cookies solely for the purpose of holding information during on-line sessions (for example, to hold answers to on-line quizzes for short-term storage, or to create an ID for use in a multiple-session assessment). If, however, a child voluntarily discloses personal information--such as a name or e-mail address--on bulletin boards or in chat areas that are accessible to other users, then such information could be collected and disclosed by others. Houghton Mifflin cannot take any responsibility for such collection or disclosure. 

_Involvement of parents:_ In accordance with the provisions of the Children's Online Privacy Act, we will notify parents when collecting personal information from children, and will seek parental consent before collecting, using and/or disclosing certain personal information from children. A parent may review and have deleted their child's personal information, and may refuse to permit further collection or use of their child's information by contacting the Houghton Mifflin representatives listed below. Parents may consent to our collection and use of their child's personal information without consenting to the disclosure of that information to others.
