### What personal information about customers does Education180.com gather?

Information we gather on our site helps us enhance the experience that future visitors may have on our site. Here are the types of information we gather: 

  * #### Information You Give Us

We collect information from you when you use our site, navigate around our site, register on our site, subscribe to our newsletter, respond to survey, or fill out a form.

On our site, you will find a variety of forms. Each form pertains to a particular school or educational institution. Each form may collect information such as Name, Phone number, email address, postal address, gender, and age. Not all forms require all the information. You can choose not to provide the information, but you may not be able to complete the process of requesting information from that school. We use the information you provide to inform the schools of your interest and the best way of getting in contact with you. You may be contacted via phone, sms, postal mail or email by a representative of the school. You may request information from more than one school, which means you may be contacted by each school. We may sell your information to other partner companies if your request for information is rejected by a school. In this case a partner may contact you with other educational offers. If you opt into the newsletter, you may receive other info from our site or our partners. This is not a required question to complete the form. 

We also want you to know that we do at times send the information to third party validation services to ensure all of the information is accurate and true. This helps us ensure that the schools which you are requesting information from have the most accurate way of getting in contact with you.

  * #### Information from Other Sources

We do receive information from other sources and append this to the information that is sent to each school.
