Please note that some of our contracted provider's group companies may be located overseas in countries which do not have as extensive data protection laws as in the United Kingdom - for example, our contracted provider's software developers require certain test data (which may consist of Personal Information) and they are based in India.

(i) if we are required to do so by applicable law or under a court or similar order;

**Hyperlinks to other web sites**

5.1 This website contains hyperlinks to websites owned and operated by third parties which are beyond our control. For example, when you use our search engine for certain courses, the search results will provide links to other sites from our website's pages that take you outside our website. These other sites have their own privacy policies and we urge you to review them - because this Privacy Policy will not apply. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for the privacy practices of such third party websites and your use of such websites is at your own risk. 

5.2 We generally do not object to you linking directly to the homepage of our website, although we reserve the right to refuse our authorisation to such linking at our sole discretion.

5.3 We reserve the right to move or change our website URL at any time in order to meet changing business needs and to continually improve our online service. External websites link to our website at their own risk. 

**Cookies**

6.1 When you view or use our website we may store information on the hard drive of your computer in the form of a "cookie" (essentially a small text file). Cookies allow us to tailor our website to your interests and preferences. For example, a cookie might contain information about the web pages you have visited on our website, which could allow us to customise your next visit to our website.

We may present search result links in a format that enables us to understand whether they have been followed and we may monitor click-throughs. We use this information to understand and improve the quality of our search technology. For instance, this data helps us determine how often users are satisfied with the first result of a query and how often they proceed to later results.
