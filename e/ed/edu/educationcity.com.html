    <p>Protecting your privacy is important to us. We hope the following privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") will help you understand how we collect, use and safeguard the personal information you provide to us on this EducationCity.com web site (the "Site.</p>
<p>We are committed to making your use of the Site easy and enjoyable as possible. Please take a moment to read the following Privacy Policy to determine how your personal information will be treated as you make full use of our many offerings. By using the Site, or providing the information requested by the Site, or by continuing to use the Site after having an opportunity to review this Privacy Policy, you agree to accept the terms of our Privacy Policy and our use of the information we collect. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site.</p>
<p>EducationCity.com reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time without giving you prior notice. Your use of the Site following any such modification constitutes your agreement to be bound by this Privacy Policy as modified.</p>
<p>I. What personally identifiable information does EducationCity.com collect from me and how does EducationCity.com use my information?</p>
<p>To create an account, we collect your name, email address, child/children’s name and date of birth and your home address. You will then receive a password that you will need to gain access to our site. We will initially use this information to set up your account, to send you a registration confirmation email and to send you further information about our product or services.</p>
<p>Referral emails that you initiate from the "Tell a Friend" page of our account will be sent by us on your behalf and will display your email address. By opting to use this form, you are consenting to our terms if a referral signs up for an account; he/she will be subject to the same standards of our Privacy Policy and our users.</p>
<p>We use other trusted third party business partners to host a short survey or offer form on the Site which, with your consent, will collect the personally identifiable information entered on the preceding address form page in order to supply you with information about various special offers and services. If you agree to participate in a special offer hosted by a third party business partner, your personally identifiable information included in the short survey or offer form will be transferred by our third party business partners to EducationCity.com only.&nbsp; All information provided to our third party business partners is subject to the posted privacy policies of our third party business partners. For your protection, our third party business partners are prohibited from accessing any of your personal information until you consent to such transfer and such business partner has provided you a link to its privacy policy. We urge you to review such privacy policy before consenting to the transfer of your personal information.</p>
<p>In order to enhance the service we provide, and to expedite systemic processes, we may pre-populate data fields on a third party business partner's survey or offer form with the information that you provided to EducationCity.com on the Site. Additionally, we may use certain third party business partners to host the survey or offer form and transfer the completed survey or offer form to other third party business partners. In an effort to safeguard your privacy, third party business partners are contractually prohibited from using any information in a pre-populated data field until they have posted a link to the privacy policy of the third party business partner/advertiser listed in the applicable offer and you have consented to the transfer of such personal information by consenting to the offer or submitting the survey. Likewise, third party business partners that serve as the host of the survey or offer form are contractually prohibited from using or retaining your personal information for any purpose other than the compilation and transfer of such personal information to EducationCity.com. Once your personal information is transferred to a third party business partner your personal information is subject to that partner's privacy policy and EducationCity.com is not responsible for use of your personal information by such business partner.</p>
<p>In a further effort to safeguard your privacy, you are provided with the option of exiting the survey or offer process of our third party business partners at any time prior to submitting your personal information to such third party business partner offer or survey. You must consent to each offer on an individual basis for your personally identifiable information to be transmitted, accessed and used by such third party business partner.</p>
<p>When you place an order or renew your subscription your information will be requested again. Our suppliers will also safeguard your personal information and are contractually prohibited from disclosing your personal information to other parties for any reason. They will not have access to any referral information you provide.</p>
<p>Our goal is to deliver surveys, offers and promotions to people who we believe will find them of value. Offers are developed and managed under strict conditions designed to safeguard the security and privacy of customer personal information. When you click on a survey, offer or competition you will be redirected to the appropriate site. An instruction box will appear explaining to which survey, offer or promotion you are being redirected. Although the site may still display an EducationCity.com address on the landing page, you are in fact on a third party offer provider's website, and any information you submit will be transmitted to this third party.</p>
<p>As a member of the Site, we will be sending transactional emails for various reasons as you continue to use our site. For example, a welcome email will be sent thanking you for joining, or an email telling you an about exciting offers and other services we offer etc. These emails are required for logistical purposes and users cannot opt-out of these at any time.</p>
