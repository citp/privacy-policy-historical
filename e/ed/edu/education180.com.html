						<b>Privacy Policy</b><br><br>
Education180.com understands that you are concerned about how your information is used and shared. This notice explains our privacy policy and how your information may or may not be used by our site. <br><br>

<b>What personal information about customers does Education180.com gather?</b><br>
Information we gather on our site helps us enhance the experience that future visitors may have on our site. Here are the types of information we gather:
<ul>
<li><b>Information You Give Us</b><br>
On our site, you will find a variety of forms. Each form pertains to a particular school or educational institution. Each form may collect information such as Name, Phone number, email address, postal address, gender, and age. Not all forms require all the information. You can choose not to provide the information, but you may not be able to complete the process of requesting information from that school.   We use the information you provide to inform the schools of your interest and the best way of getting in contact with you. You will usually be contacted via phone or email by a representative of the school. You may request information from more than one school, which means you may be contacted by each school. We do not resell the information to any company unless you authorize us to do so, by agreeing to be part of the Education180.com newsletter. This is not a required question to complete the form. <br><br>

We also want you to know that we do at times send the information to third party validation services to ensure all of the information is accurate and true. This helps us ensure that the schools which you are requesting information from have the most accurate way of getting in contact with you. <br><br>

</li><li><b>Automatic Information</b><br>

You can disable cookies in your web browser, however this may affect the experience you have on our site, since you may not be able to see all of the features. The cookies we set do have an expiration date and will automatically be disabled after the expiration date. <br><br>

</li><li><b>Information from Other Sources</b><br>
We do receive information from other sources and append this to the information that is sent to each school. Examples of this information are the following: Source of where you initially clicked on an advertisement, what you may have typed in, during your search at Google, Yahoo!, Ask, or MSN which spawns our advertisement.
