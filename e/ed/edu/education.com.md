Tell-A-Friend

_

If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. education.com will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. education.com stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. The friend may contact education.com at [jkern@education.com](mailto:jkern@education.com) to request the removal of this information from their database.

How do we use your personal information?

**

The personal information you provide education.com will allow us to: (1) process orders; (2) notify contest winners and fulfill prizes; (3) solicit editorials and feedback; (4) monitor and verify education.com's compliance with stated privacy policies as well as with federal, state and local laws; (5) monitor and improve the use and satisfaction of our site; and, (6) for marketing and promotional purposes. We will only collect information to the extent deemed reasonably necessary to fulfill these business objectives.

Third Parties

**

The personal identifying information you provide us is collected by and shared among education.com sites and is not disclosed to third parties without your permission. If education.com wishes to disclose your personal information, we will ask for your consent at the time you register.

However, if you place an order at the education.com On-line Store, which is operated by Digital River Inc., the personal information you provide ( name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number and expiration date ) is collected by Digital River Inc. Although Digital River Inc., not education.com, collects the personal information you provide when you order from the education.com On-line Store, education.com still requires that Digital River Inc. adhere to education.com's Privacy Policy. This means that Digital River Inc. will never share your personal information with or sell your personal information to any third parties. 

education.com may disclose your personal information without consent, however, if we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) education.com's rights or property, other education.com users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. education.com may also disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.

In addition, education.com shares aggregate information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties. For example, we will say education.com's audience is x percent females and y percent males. This data is used to customize education.com content and advertising to deliver a better experience for our users.

Links

**

Users should also be aware that when you are on education.com, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There are links to other sites from education.com pages that take you outside our service. For example, if you "click" on an advertisement or an education.com search result, the "click" takes you off the education.com site. This includes links from advertisers, Center sponsors and partners that may use education.com's logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other sites may send you their own cookies, and collect data or solicit personal information from you.

education.com uses cookies on its Web site. Cookies are pieces of information that a web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make Web-surfing easier for you by saving your preferences and browsing patterns while you're at our site.

education.com also keeps track of Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses.

Safeguarding your Personal Information

CHILDREN UNDER 13 YEARS OLD

** _

Information Collection and Parental Consent

_

Children under 13 may not activate a KidSpace/education.com member account without the verifiable offline consent of a parent or legal guardian ("Parent"). In order to become a KidSpace member at education.com, a child must fill out a registration form that asks for a Smart ID (nickname), password, first name, state and country of residence, birth date, gender, Parent's name and e-mail address or postal address when e-mail address is unknown. We use this information to inform a parent, via an automatically generated email or postal mailing, of the child's interest and desire to become a KidSpace member. If the parent does not respond within a reasonable amount of time from the time the information is collected, the child's information is deleted. If the parent does respond, however, any additional information submitted by a parent during the registration process may be retained by KidSpace/education.com. A parent may also agree to allow education.com collect information about his or her child without agreeing to allow the information be distributed to third parties. 

By providing offline consent and registering your child as a KidSpace member, you are consenting to allow your child to: (1) enter our contests; (2) submit artwork, creative writing, jokes, etc. to our online forums and galleries; and, (3) participate in our community features such as email, chat rooms (public and personal), and bulletin boards (public and personal). Please note that education.com does not condition your child's participation in any of these activities on the child disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in that activity. 

_Access and Control of Child's Information_  


If for any reason you wish to access, review, correct or delete the personal information already collected about your child, please visit the OurFamilySpace section of our site, and click on Parental Controls. This area of our site allows you to approve, disapprove or change the list of friends your child has chosen for his or her KidSpace membership profile. In addition, along with each email newsletter, we include instructions on how you may remove your child from these mailing lists. We also notify a parent whenever his or her child (KidSpace member) wins a contest; and, we send an email to the parent associated with his or her account in order to get confirmation of eligibility and a mailing address. 

  
**Policies for Teens (Individuals 13-17 Years of Age)**

Teens are asked to provide the e-mail address of a parent or guardian. If the parent or guardian e-mail address is provided, a notification message is then sent to the parent or guardian informing them of the teens' membership at education.com.

  
**Internet Safety Tips:**

  * Keep your passwords private, even from your best friend! Your online service will never ask for them, so neither should anyone else. 
  * Use only your member name and/or e-mail address when chatting or sending e-mail. Never give out personal information like your name, address, or phone number. 
  * Always delete unknown e-mail attachments before opening them. They can contain destructive viruses. 
  * Remember that nothing you write on the Web is completely private - including email. So be careful and think about what you type in and whom you talk to. Not everyone is as nice, cute and funny as they may sound online. Never make plans to meet an online "friend" in person.
