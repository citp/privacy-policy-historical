## Information We Collect

We may collect information about you directly from you, from third parties, and automatically through your use of our Services. We may combine information collected from or about you from these various sources.

### Information We Collect Directly from You

We collect information directly from you in several places on our Services, as set forth generally below.

#### **Registration**

Currently, visitors to our Services are able to access some content without becoming a member. However, if you would like to download worksheets, engage in digital learning experiences, customize or personalize certain content, gain access to certain community features, or rate editorial content, you are required to register to become a member. In order to register, you must supply us with a valid email address and password; as well as some additional voluntary information about you (e.g., your "type": parent, teacher, or student; school affiliation, grade focus, zip code, etc.).

#### **Premium Services**

If you’d like access to one or more of our paid offerings (including Education.com Pro, Plus, and Workbooks), you'll need to register for that offering, and you'll be asked to provide additional personal, billing, or other specified information that we'll need to charge for and activate the service or product. Customers purchasing one or more of our paid offerings will be asked to provide basic personal information about their children such as a screen name. 

#### **Public Forums: Blogs and Comments**

As a service to our users, we feature Blogs and Comments where users with similar interests can share information and support one another, send messages to one another, provide a review of our products, comment on editorial content. Information shared in Blogs and through Comments postings is accessible to the general public and may be viewed, disclosed to, or collected by third parties that do not adhere to our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use/) or this Privacy Policy or that may use the information to send you unsolicited communications. In addition, we may retain this information as necessary to resolve disputes, provide customer support, and troubleshoot problems as permitted by law. You should think carefully before disclosing any personal information in any public forum.

#### **Surveys/Polls**

At certain times, you may be asked to participate in surveys, which are generally aimed at obtaining general information, such as your reactions to a particular article or feature set on our site. Because information obtained in these surveys is connected with individual subscribers and is used internally to improve our products or better market our services, participation is voluntary.

#### **Contests and Sweepstakes**

We sometimes offer contests or sweepstakes in which certain personal information is required for registration, for purposes of verifying the entrants’ identities and notifying the winners. If the contest or sweepstakes is being administered by a third party, this information will be disclosed to that third party. However, entrants may select contest names distinct from their User Names, and the information is not connected with their User Names.

#### **Other Information You Provide Through Our Services**

We will also collect any other information that you provide through our Services, such as your name, email address, job title, phone number, school or organization name, account type, payment type, and the contents of any message you submit through our Services.

### Information We Collect from Third Parties

You can create an account with us, by logging in through certain third-party accounts, such as Facebook, Google, and Clever. By logging in through a third-party account, you grant Education.com permission to access certain information from that third-party account as explained on the permissions page when you log in, including: your name, email and public profile ID.

### Information We Collect Automatically

We may also automatically collect information about users of our Services through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies. The collected information may include, but is not limited to, IP address, domain name; browser type and operating system; web pages viewed while logged in; links clicked; the length of time spent on our Services; and the referring URL, or the webpage that led a user to our Services. In addition, we will collect information about user activities within our Services, such as which games a user plays, the number of correct and incorrect answers, and download history.

## Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms

### Our Tracking

Tracking data consists of both individual and aggregated tracking information and is automatically gathered using “cookies.” A cookie is a small data file containing information, such as a user’s member name, that is written to the user’s hard drive by a web server and used to track the pages visited.

We use cookies in several ways to track users’ navigation through our Services. First, the information we gather on an individual basis is used for internal purposes only, such as accessing a member profile. We also use tracking information on an aggregate basis, to track the usage of our products, to analyze patterns on our Services, and to provide anonymous reporting of usage for internal and external clients. In all cases, our cookies are encoded and contain a unique digital signature to prevent tampering. They do not contain user passwords. We also employ technology that is commonly referred to as “action tags” (also known as “web beacons” or “one pixel .gif files”) to measure the effectiveness of our advertisements.

You can control your browser’s settings regarding cookies by selecting “Internet Options” or “Preferences” in the menu bar of your browser. This will allow you to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, have your browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or disable cookies altogether. However, because cookies allow you to easily navigate our Services without having to constantly log in using your User Name and password, we recommend that you leave them turned on.

### Tracking by our contractors and agents

We use third-party online business optimization software (including Google Analytics, Optimizely, and CrazyEgg), to assist us in the capture and analysis of customer usage information. These service providers act as limited agents to us, for the purpose of providing their services. Any information obtained by such third parties from our users or us is and will remain our property, and will be subject to this privacy policy. We do not permit these service providers to review, share, distribute, print, or reference any session data of visitors to our Services, except as specified in our agreements with them or as may be required by law. To learn more about the privacy practices of such service providers, we encourage you to review the [Google Privacy Policy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/); the [Salesforce Marketing Cloud Privacy Policy](https://www.marketingcloud.com/privacy-policy/); the [Optimizely Privacy Policy](https://www.optimizely.com/privacy/) and Optimizely’s [opt-out instructions](https://www.optimizely.com/opt_out/); and the [CrazyEgg Privacy Policy](https://www.crazyegg.com/privacy/) and the [Crazy Egg opt-out feature](https://www.crazyegg.com/opt-out/).

### Tracking by Our Advertisers

Our advertisers include a wide variety of companies, such as financial services companies (e.g., brokerage firms, banks, and mortgage companies), computer manufacturers, software companies, automobile makers, toy manufacturers, and retail stores. Our advertisers and advertising vendors display targeted advertisements. Although we do not provide any personal information to the advertiser or advertising vendor, by interacting with or clicking on an ad you consent to the possibility that the advertiser will assume you meet the criteria used to target the ad.

In addition to cookies placed by us or our agents, as described above, advertisers and advertising vendors that serve ads onto our Services or other services may use their own cookies or other tracking technologies. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of any such advertisers and vendors.

We use independent advertising networks to deliver advertising content to the pages that you view on our Services – such as Google AdX, Brealtime, Yieldbot, AOL, Appnexus, Sovrn among others. If you would like to know more about these companies’ privacy practices, please review their policies on their respective sites. If you wish to opt out of any of these company’s information collection and analysis, follow the opt out instructions described in their privacy policy.

  * [Appnexus](https://www.appnexus.com/en/company/platform-privacy-policy)
  * [Sovrn](https://www.sovrn.com/privacy-policy/)



We allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our Services. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to our Services and other websites or applications in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third-party web beacon to collect this information. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit [networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/).

## Security

We have implemented safeguards to protect the information we collect. Please be aware that despite our efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security.

You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity. 

If you are a parent, teacher, or school administrator, we encourage you to talk to your children about online safety and how they can protect themselves online. For more information, see the Federal Trade Commission’s [Protecting Kids Online](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/topics/protecting-kids-online) resource.

If we make changes that materially affect our uses or disclosures of personal information that we have previously collected from you, we will provide a mechanism for you to opt out of the new use or disclosure.

## Your Independent Relationship With Other Companies

Our Services may contain links to third-party websites and applications. Please note that this Privacy Policy will not apply to your independent relationships with other companies that from time to time may offer you products and services, or are otherwise linked from on our Services. Those companies’ privacy policies will govern how they collect, use and disclose personal information that you provide to them.

In addition, some of our advertising partners will on occasion take polls of our visitors, in which case you would provide your information directly to the advertising partner. Such polls are for use by the advertising partner, and participation is voluntary. We do not assure privacy of information voluntarily provided in response to a survey or poll.
