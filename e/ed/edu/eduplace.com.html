The following paragraphs summarize Houghton Mifflin's
         policy regarding the collection and use of personal
         information about children.
</p><p>
<u>Types of personal information collected:</u> Under the
         Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, "personal
         information" is defined as individually identifiable
         information such as a first and last name, a home or other
         physical address including street name and city or town, an
         e-mail address, a telephone number, a Social Security
         number, or persistent identifiers such as customer or
         processor serial numbers held in a cookie, where the
         identifier is associated with individually identifiable
         information. Cookies are small pieces of information that
         are stored in a designated file on a user's computer.
         Houghton Mifflin usually does not collect personal
         information, as defined under the Children's Online Privacy
         Protection Act. We collect and use only as much information
         about children as necessary for the activity, and do not
         condition participation in any on-line activity on the
         disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably
         necessary. Occasionally, we use cookies to store pertinent
         user information during a session.
</p><p>
<u>Use of personal information:</u> We use the
         information we collect from children only for internal
         business purposes, and/or to give credit to children for
         work they have created. We contact children by e-mail only
         in response to their requests for information or assistance.
         Houghton Mifflin uses cookies solely for the purpose of
         holding information during on-line sessions (for example, to
         hold answers to on-line quizzes for short-term storage, or
         to create an ID for use in a multiple-session assessment).
         If, however, a child voluntarily discloses personal
         information--such as a name or e-mail address--on bulletin
         boards or in chat areas that are accessible to other users,
         then such information could be collected and disclosed by
         others. Houghton Mifflin cannot take any responsibility for
         such collection or disclosure.
</p><p>
<u>Involvement of parents: </u>In accordance with the
         provisions of the Children's Online Privacy Act, we will
         notify parents when collecting personal information from
         children, and will seek parental consent before collecting,
         using and/or disclosing certain personal information from
         children. A parent may review and have deleted their child's
         personal information, and may refuse to permit further
         collection or use of their child's information by contacting
         the Houghton Mifflin representatives listed below. Parents
         may consent to our collection and use of their child's
         personal information without consenting to the disclosure of
         that information to others.
</p><p>

<u>How to get in touch with Houghton Mifflin: </u>The
         following list has the names, addresses, and phone numbers
