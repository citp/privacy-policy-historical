We will initially use this information to set up your account, to send you a registration confirmation email and to send you further information about our product or services.

Referral emails that you initiate from the "Tell a Friend" page of our account will be sent by us on your behalf and will display your email address. By opting to use this form, you are consenting to our terms if a referral signs up for an account; he/she will be subject to the same standards of our Privacy Policy and our users.

We use other trusted third party business partners to host a short survey or offer form on the Site which, with your consent, will collect the personally identifiable information entered on the preceding address form page in order to supply you with information about various special offers and services. If you agree to participate in a special offer hosted by a third party business partner, your personally identifiable information included in the short survey or offer form will be transferred by our third party business partners to EducationCity.com only.  All information provided to our third party business partners is subject to the posted privacy policies of our third party business partners.

We urge you to review such privacy policy before consenting to the transfer of your personal information.

In order to enhance the service we provide, and to expedite systemic processes, we may pre-populate data fields on a third party business partner's survey or offer form with the information that you provided to EducationCity.com on the Site. Additionally, we may use certain third party business partners to host the survey or offer form and transfer the completed survey or offer form to other third party business partners.
