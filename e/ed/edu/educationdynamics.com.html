<p><b>Overview</b></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy (hereinafter “Policy”) governs your use of the Site. This Policy describes much of the information that we collect from you and what may happen to that information.&nbsp;For example, this Policy is intended to let you know about information we collect from you; what cookies are and how they may be used; how your information is often used; who is collecting your information; with whom your information may be shared; what options are available to you regarding collection, use, and distribution of your information; how you may use other users’ information; the types of security precautions in place to protect against loss, misuse, or alteration of your information; how EducationDynamics protects children’s privacy; and other important information about your online privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that we review our privacy practices from time to time, and that our practices are subject to change.&nbsp;We ask that you bookmark and periodically review this page to ensure continuing familiarity with the most current version of our Privacy Policy.&nbsp;All amended terms shall be automatically effective after they are posted on the Site and applied retroactively if you use the Site after this Policy is amended.</p>

<p><b>What Personally Identifiable Information does EducationDynamics collect?</b></p>
<p>A primary purpose of collecting information from you is to provide you with a safe, smooth, effective, and personalized experience.&nbsp;We will only collect information about you that we consider necessary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally, EducationDynamics collects information in several ways.&nbsp;Some information is gathered if you fill out the form provided.&nbsp;This information includes, but is not limited to, your name, address, phone number, age, email address, and information concerning your educational interests.&nbsp;You may also choose to submit optional information, such as a password if you register. &nbsp;We often indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional.&nbsp;Additionally, we save browsing and data log information linked to your account.&nbsp;We also collect personal information when you report a problem, either through the Site’s contact form or email system.&nbsp;We may also collect information that you post on our blogs, message boards, or forums. &nbsp;If you contact EducationDynamics, we may keep a record of that correspondence.</p>
<p><b>What are “cookies” and how does EducationDynamics use them?</b></p>
<p>Data collection devices, “cookies” (including without limitation “confirmation pixels” for crediting affiliate marketers and/or for other purposes) are used to store, and sometimes track, information about you.&nbsp;Generally, cookies help provide personalized services and promote trust and safety.&nbsp;A cookie is a small file containing a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and placed on your computer’s hard drive to assist us in providing our services.&nbsp;All pages on the Site where you are prompted to login or that are customizable may require that you accept cookies.&nbsp;Our cookies are only read by the server that placed them and are unable to execute any code or virus.&nbsp;More specifically, we may use cookies to:</p>
<p>(1) Remind us of who you are when you login and to access your account information in order to deliver to you a more personalized service;</p>
<p>(2) Allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session;</p>
<p>(3) Measure your visiting patterns and education-related parameters in the aggregate.&nbsp;Aggregate data (data gathered across all user accounts) may be gathered in a non-personally identifiable form to build higher quality online services by performing statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our visitors, such as how long and how often users view certain pages;</p>
<p>(4) Determine your clickstream to the Site;</p>
<p>(5) Better personalize the content that you and other users will see on the Site;</p>
<p>(6) Collect IP addresses and log-in information for system administration;</p>
<p>(7) Automatically share some information with Google Analytics and other analytics programs to analyze a broad range of information.&nbsp;However, the analytics are exclusively for our internal use to better manage the website experience for our visitors and evaluate advertising strategies and tactics; and</p>
<p>(8) Other purposes to assist us in delivering the highest quality service possible.</p>
<p>You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits.</p>
<p><b>How does EducationDynamics use my information?</b></p>

<p><b>Who is collecting information?</b></p>
<p>When you are using the Site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with EducationDynamics. You acknowledge that data can be collected, maintained by, or transferred to a company, an educational institution, or other entity, within the sole judgment of EducationDynamics.&nbsp;You also acknowledge and agree that the data can be combined and/or refined and/or used in any other matter with data from any of the websites owned and/or operated, in whole or in part, by EducationDynamics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be advised that EducationDynamics advertisers or websites that have links on the Site may collect personally identifiable information about you.&nbsp;The information practices of those websites linked to EducationDynamics.com are not covered by this Policy.</p>

<p>Some of our employees and contractors are subject to non-disclosure agreements with us.&nbsp;These and other legal restrictions may prohibit their use of the information you provide us for any purpose except to facilitate the specific EducationDynamics-related operation, unless you explicitly agreed or gave your prior permission to them for additional uses.</p>
<p>If you complete a transaction with an advertiser linked to EducationDynamics, the information obtained during your visit to that advertiser, and the information you give, may be provided to the advertiser.&nbsp;Advertisers linked to the Site have separate policy practices for which EducationDynamics has no responsibility or liability.</p>
<p>We may disclose account information where we have reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating EducationDynamics’s policies as specified in the Privacy Policy or relevant User Agreement, may be violating state or federal law, or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) EducationDynamics’s rights or property, other users of the Site, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.&nbsp;EducationDynamics may disclose or access account information when we believe that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain and improve our services.</p>

<p><b>How may I use other users’ information?</b></p>
<p>Recognizing the global nature of the Internet, you agree to comply with all applicable local laws and rules regarding online conduct and privacy, as well as content.&nbsp;Specifically, but not as a limitation, you agree to comply with all applicable laws regarding transmission of technical and personal data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside.</p>
