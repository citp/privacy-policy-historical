This Privacy Policy describes how we treat personal information received about you when you visit our Site like the collection and use of the personal information you provide.  It also describes the choices available to you regarding the use of, your access to, and how to update and correct your personal information.

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully, because by visiting or using this Site, you agree to its terms.

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make any material change to this Privacy Policy, we will inform you by posting a notice on the home page of this Site or by e-mail of this Site that the policy has been updated prior to the change becoming effective and by changing the date on this page noting when the policy was last updated. If you see a notice of change, please check the Privacy Policy, because your continued use of the Site after we post the change means you have agreed to the new terms.

 **Collection of Your Data**

Personal Data. When you fill out a "Student Matching Profile", our Self-Assessment, our Financial Aid Estimator, and at other times, we ask for some information about you, such as your name, age, email address, postal address, and phone number, level of education, desired level of educational program, areas of interest, current occupation, military status (if any), governmental loan status. We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13.  If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to us, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information and terminate the child's account from our databases.

Anonymous Data. As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. We automatically collect IP addresses and Web site usage information from you when you visit the Site. This information helps us evaluate how our visitors use and navigate the Site on an aggregate basis, including the number and frequency of visitors to each Web page, and the length of their visits. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or site functionality.

 **How We Use Your Information and How We Share Your Data**

EducationDynamics will not sell or disclose your personally identifiable information except as described below:

If you use our site or if you post on our blogs, forums, message boards, or chat rooms, some personally identifiable information may be seen by other members or users. This includes, but is not limited to, the poster's name, date of post, comments, IP address, survey responses, and other information. This information may also be transferred to any outside entity, including the press or other media that visits our site. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or forum, contact us at [info@educationdynamics.com](mailto:info@educationdynamics.com?subject=Privacy%20Inquiry). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

We use the information we automatically collect (such as contact information, IP address and basic browser and system details) to help us optimize our sites and the services we offer on the Sites and may offer in the future. We also collect personal information and share it with trusted third parties to analyze and provide us with feedback, suggestions and strategies to improve our business processes and the services we provide. If you provide us with personally identifiable information (such as your name, age, whether or not you are a U.S. citizen, address, phone number, e-mail address, military affiliation, educational background, and years of work experience), such information may also be used for marketing purposes, and may result in follow-up communications from EducationDynamics, our affiliated properties and services, and institutions of higher education about opportunities, programs and other services that are related to education. EducationDynamics maintains business relationships with these institutions, which pay EducationDynamics for the information. Use of your personal information by these educational institutions is not governed by this Privacy Policy. For further information on such institution’s use of your information, please visit the applicable privacy policy of such institution. Educational institutions have separate policy practices for which EducationDynamics has no responsibility or liability.

In addition, from time to time, we may share personally identifiable information (such as e-mail addresses and other contact information such as name, email address and phone number) with carefully selected third parties, so they may offer goods and services that we believe may be of interest to our customers.  If you do not want us to share your personal information with these companies, you may coordinate with these 3rd parties to remove your name from their lists.

We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.

If you submit information to an advertiser or other third party that is made available on or through EducationDynamics, the information obtained during your visit to that advertiser’s website, and the information you give to the advertiser will be governed by the advertiser’s privacy policy. For further information on such advertiser’s use of your information, please visit the applicable privacy policy of such advertisers. Advertisers made available on this site have separate policy practices for which EducationDynamics has no responsibility or liability.

We may disclose account information where we have reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating EducationDynamics's policies as specified in the Privacy Policy or relevant User Agreement, may be violating state or federal law, or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) EducationDynamics's rights or property, other users of the Site, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. EducationDynamics may disclose or access account information when we believe that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain and improve our services.

Additionally, EducationDynamics uses your information to provide you with a customized browsing experience. We also may use your personal information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, respond to your inquiries, detect and protect against error, fraud, or other criminal activity, enforce our User Agreement, and for any other purposes that EducationDynamics deems appropriate.

We cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Policy. For example, we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they unlawfully collect from the Site. We will try to protect your privacy, however, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.
