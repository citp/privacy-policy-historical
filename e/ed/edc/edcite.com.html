<h2 class="Subheading2">General</h2>
<p>At Edcite Inc., we respect your need for online privacy and protect any Personal Information that you may share with us, in an appropriate manner. Our practice as regards use of your Personal Information is as set forth below in this Privacy Policy Statement. As a condition to use of Edcite Services, you consent to the terms of the Privacy Policy Statement as it may be updated from time to time. In the event of a material change, we shall notify you via email or by means of a prominent notice on the website. This Privacy Policy Statement applies exclusively to&nbsp;www.edcite.com.</p>
<p>Edcite Inc. complies with the provisions of the U.S-E.U Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the United States Department of Commerce, with regards to the collection, use and storage of Personal Information received from the European Union. For more information about the U.S-E.U Safe Harbor framework kindly visit&nbsp;http://export.gov/safeharbor/.</p>
<h2 class="Subheading2">Children's Online Privacy Protection</h2>
<p>As a teacher oriented site, Edcite does not directly sign-up users who are under 13 years of age. &nbsp;Students sign up and use Edcite only with the authorization of a teacher, and need a valid class code from the teacher to sign up. &nbsp;Teachers may instruct students of any age to join their class on Edcite. &nbsp;This sign up process collects the following information from students: &nbsp;a unique userid provided by the student, a password, first name, last name, and optionally an email address. &nbsp;This student information is used solely to provide the student and their teachers access to the Edcite online education application, and will not be shared with any third-parties. &nbsp;The optional student email address is used solely to provide notifications of new work assigned by the teacher, and will not be shared with any third-parties.</p>
<p>Results of student activity on Edcite are securely stored on Edcite servers, and are visible only to the student, and to their teachers, who see only the results of the specific subset of work assigned by that teacher. &nbsp;Teachers do not get to see results of student work assigned by other teachers.</p>
<p>Edcite treats individual student personal information and activity data as highly sensitive information that will not be shared with anyone except the student's teacher, and will only be used within Edcite&nbsp;as needed to provide our online education services to teachers and students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
