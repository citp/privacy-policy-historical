# Privacy Policy - Edelman

**Edelman.com Privacy Policy**

**Our Commitment to Privacy**

At Edelman, we are strongly committed to protecting the privacy of visitors to Edelman.com (the “Site”). You can navigate the majority of the Site without giving us any personal information which identifies you.  However, sometimes we need additional information about you in order to provide you with information or services you want to receive from us.   Also, this Site provides a variety of interactive features which provides you with a public forum through which you can provide information about yourself to Edelman and others.

In this digital world, privacy is important to Edelman and should be important to you. Edelman believes in transparency and we provide this notice so that you can understand our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

**The Information We Collect**

Edelman collects two basic types of information:

  * **Personally identifiable information:** This is information that personally identifies one individual from another (for example, names, e-mail addresses and other contact information). This information is voluntarily provided to us by our site visitors and is used by us for the purpose of responding to user submissions and fulfilling requests for further information about our services.
  * **Aggregate user and tracking information:** This information gives us insights on how our site visitors use our site. This data is anonymous and does not contain any personally identifiable information. We use this information to ensure that our website, e-mails and marketing efforts continue to appeal to our site visitors and clients.



**Information you voluntarily provide to Edelman**

Edelman only collects personally identifiable information that you voluntarily provide, for example, when you sign up for a newsletter, set up a voluntary user profile to post content within our forums or interactive features. Examples of such personally identifiable information that you provide to us may include, among other information, your name, physical address and email address.

**Other information Edelman collects**

When you visit this Site, we may automatically collect some information about your visit using cookies, log analysis software and other aggregate tracking technologies.

If you wish, you may set your browser to refuse cookies. However, by refusing to accept a cookie, you may not be able to access some pages or use some of the features or functions of the Site.   Some Edelman cookie files remain on your computer’s hard drive unless and until you manually delete the file. Edelman cookie files do not contain personally identifiable information.

**The Way We Use Information**

We store the information you provide about yourself in a secure database in order to provide you with the information, products, and/or services you request. The information is stored for the lifetime of the database unless you request that it be removed. The information you provide us about yourself will be shared with Edelman employees and service providers to the extent necessary to accommodate your request.

For example, if you provide your name, mailing address, telephone and email address and request more information about Edelman services, this information will be shared with appropriate Edelman personnel to fulfill your request. This information will not be shared with any outside third parties without your consent.

We use non-identifying and aggregate information about the use of our Website to improve the navigation, content, and design of our site. This information may include, for example, the most and least requested pages, analyzing traffic regarding specific features,  and the number of users from the U.S. and other countries, among other things.

Finally, unless otherwise excepted below, we would not use your personally identifiable information provided to us online for purposes other than those you requested without also providing you an opportunity to agree or otherwise limit such unrelated purposes.  Edelman will not sell or distribute personally identifiable information collected from you outside of Edelman without your consent (subject to the limited exceptions stated in this policy).

**Contests or Sweepstakes**

We may operate contests and sweepstakes through the Site, which may require registration in order to enter. Your  personally identifiable information may be used by us to contact you for winner notification, prize delivery confirmation or other promotional purposes. Your entry in the contest or sweepstakes may also result in your being added to our mailing/texting lists as well as those of our promotional partners associated with the contest or sweepstakes.  Acceptance of a prize may require you (unless prohibited by law)  to allow us to post publicly some of your information on the Site, such as in social media or on a winner’s page, in the event you win a contest or sweepstakes.

**Surveys or Voting**

From time-to-time we may request  personally identifiable information from you via surveys or voting polls. Participation is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information. At times, you may have to register to vote or to take part in a survey.

**Exceptions**

Edelman may preserve and has the right to disclose any information about you or your use of the Site without your prior permission if Edelman has a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) protect and defend the rights, property or safety of Edelman or its clients or their respective partners, employees, affiliates, other users of the Site, or the public; (b) enforce the Terms of Use for the Site; or (c) respond to claims related to your use of the Site.   We may also disclose information as we deem necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request or  in the event of a sale or potential sale of Edelman or one of its business units.

**Interactive Areas**

The Site provides interactive areas, such as chat rooms, forums and message boards available to its users. You are not required to provide any personal information when using these areas but you may choose to do so. We strongly recommend that you DO NOT use your personal information as your user name and DO NOT post any personally-identifiable information on line, since such information will be publicly available.  We cannot ensure the security of any information you choose to make public in a chat room, forum, or message board. Also, we cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy. Please exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information in these areas.

**Our Commitment To Data Security**

Edelman understands that the safety of your personal information is extremely important to you. Accordingly, Edelman uses reasonable technological, physical and other measures to keep your information protected from unauthorized access.  Due to the nature of the Internet and related technology, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information and Edelman expressly disclaims any such obligation.
