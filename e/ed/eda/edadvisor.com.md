### 6\. Digital Millennium Copyright Act

Edvisors responds to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminates accounts of repeat infringers according to the process set out in the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) (see 17 U.S.C. 512(c)(3) for further information).

A. Notification If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any User Submission or other Edvisors content infringes upon your copyright, you may submit a written notification pursuant to the DMCA by providing our Copyright Agent (listed below) with the following information: (i) an electronic or physical signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that I allegedly infringed; (ii) a description of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed or if multiple copyrighted works are covered by the notification, a representative list of such works on or in the Services: (iii) a description of the location on the Services of the allegedly infringed material(s); (iv) your address, telephone number, and email address; (v) a written statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material(s) in the matter complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (vi) a written statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Edvisors’ designated Copyright Agent for notice of claims of infringement is:

Russ Theriault, College Loan Corporation 10000 W. Charleston Blvd., Suite 200 Las Vegas, NV 89135

Email: [rtheriault@collegeloan.com](mailto:rtheriault@collegeloan.com) Telephone: (702) 777-8405

Only notices of alleged copyright infringement should go to the Copyright Agent; any other feedback, comments, requests for technical support, and other communications should be directed to Edvisors’ customer service at [customerservice@edvisors.com](mailto:customerservice@edvisors.com). You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the notice requirements of the DMCA, your notice may not be valid.

B. Termination of Repeat Offenders In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable law, Edvisors shall, in appropriate circumstances, terminate access, at Edvisors’ sole discretion, of any general user or Member that Edvisors finds to be a repeat infringer of other copyrights. Edvisors may also, in its sole discretion, limit or fully terminate access to the Website or Service(s) of any user infringing the intellectual property rights of others, regardless of whether such user is a repeat offender or not.

### 7\. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Notice

This Website is not directed or otherwise promoted for use by children under the age of thirteen (13). Edvisors does not knowingly collect, maintain or use personal information from our websites about children under age 13. If a child whom we know to be under age 13 sends personal information to us online, we will only use that information to respond directly to that child, notify parents or seek parental consent, and will delete such information from our records. If we change our practices in the future, we will obtain prior, verifiable parental consent before collecting any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. We are not, however, responsible for the collection and use of information by companies or individuals unaffiliated with us whose websites may contain links to ours. Because we do not collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13, we also do not knowingly distribute such information to third-parties. We do not knowingly allow children under the age of 13 to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information via our site.

### 13\. Disclaimer of Warranties

You agree that use of the Services and this Website is solely at your own risk. All Services offered by Edvisors are provided on a strictly “as is” and “as available” basis, without representation or warranty of any kind. Neither Edvisors nor its third-party partners make any warranty, express or implied: (i) with regard to any products, services, or gifts obtained by you through the Services or through any third-party; (ii) that the services will meet your requirements; (iii) that the Services will be uninterrupted, timely, free of errors or without defects; (iv) as to the results you may obtain by using the Services; or (v) as to the accuracy or reliability of any information obtained via the Services. **EDVISORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL EXPRESS, IMPLIED AND STATUTORY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE INFORMATION, SERVICES OR GOODS PROVIDED BY OR THROUGH THE SERVICES (OTHER THAN THOSE INCAPABLE OF EXCLUSION UNDER THE LAWS APPLICABLE TO THESE TERMS OF USE), INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO: (I) THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY; (II) THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USER OR PURPOSE; AND (III) NON-INFRINGEMENT.

NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM EDVISORS OR VIA THE SERVICES SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY MADE HEREIN.**

### 14\. Limitation of Liability

You understand that some goods and services offered through the Services may be offered by third-parties or affiliates, and that Edvisors does not operate, control or endorse any of their information, goods or services in any way. You understand that third-parties may place restrictions on the use of goods and services offered through the Services. Neither Edvisors nor its officers, directors, stockholders, subsidiaries, employees, agents, licensors, affiliates, or other third-party providers shall be held liable for any damages or losses, whether direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages resulting from: (i) the user or inability to use the Services; (ii) the cost of procurement of substitute goods or services; (iii) any transaction entered into or through the Services; (iv) the reliance on or use of any information, goods, services or merchandise provided through the Services; (v) unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or data; (vi) statements or conduct of any third-party; (vii) any claim attributable to errors, omissions, or other inaccuracies in the Services and/or materials or information retrieved through the Services; or (viii) any other matter relating to the Services or these Terms of Use. The above limitation is applicable even if Edvisors or its authorized representatives have been advised of (or know or should know of) the possibility of such damages. Because some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, some of the above limitations and disclaimers may not apply to you.

### 18\. Arbitration: PLEASE READ CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS

  1. Most of your concerns can be resolved quickly by contacting Edvisors at [info@edvisors.com](mailto:info@edvisors.com). In the event that we cannot resolve your concern, binding arbitration through the following procedures shall be your sole and exclusive remedy. Any arbitration under these Terms of Use will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.
  2. Pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, Edvisors and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to, claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, regardless of legal theory, including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising and claims relating to any and all use of the Service(s), whether brought during or after the term of these Terms of Use. References to “Edvisors,” “you,” and “us” include our respective corporate subsidiaries and parents, affiliates, agents, employees, officers, directors, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services under these Terms of Use or prior agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. You agree that, by accepting these Terms of Use, you and Edvisors are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This Section 18 shall survive termination of these Terms of Use.
  3. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to Edvisors shall be addressed to Edvisors Network, Inc., 10000 W. Charleston Blvd., Suite 200, Las Vegas, NV 89135, Attention: President (“Edvisors Notice Address”). The Notice to you shall be addressed to any such addresses, including email addresses you may have provided Edvisors. If you have never provided Edvisors with any such address Edvisors will, after using due diligence to discover, send Notice to your last known mailing address. The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). If Edvisors and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Edvisors may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Edvisors or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Edvisors is entitled.
  4. The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement and must issue a written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which an award is based. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provisions in this Section 18 are for a court to decide. Unless Edvisors and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your home address, as provided in connection with the Notice. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If you prevail at arbitration, the arbitrator may award you reimbursement of the filing, administration and arbitrator fees you incurred, as well as reimbursement of any reasonable attorneys’ fees you incurred.
  5. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. YOU AND EDVISORS AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Edvisors agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.
  6. Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms of Use to the contrary, we agree that if Edvisors makes any change to this Section 18 (other than a change to the Edvisors Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice, to the Edvisors Notice Address, within 30 days of the change. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of these Terms of Use in the form prior to such rejected change.



### 19\. Jurisdiction

This information may be shared with our service providers, vendors or advertisers.



**B. Information Third Parties Provide**

We also may collect information about you from sources other than from you directly, such as from social media web sites (Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter or others), other users and our business partners. This [policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information or practices (including collection, usage, disclosure or data security practices) of any third parties, including any third party operating any site or service to which the Site links. The inclusion of a link on the Site does not imply our or our affiliates’ endorsement of the linked site or service.

This Privacy Policy applies solely to our privacy practices. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of our partners, service providers or any third parties, even if our ads contain links to third party web sites and even if we have a business relationship with that third party. We encourage you to review the privacy statements of each and every web site that you visit to be sure you understand the terms and conditions that apply to you from each of them.

**Supplementation of Personal Information:** In order to provide certain services to you, we may on occasion supplement the personal Information you submitted to us with information from third party sources. For example:

  * **Address Verification:** If you provide your email address during member registration or otherwise, we use third parties in order to verify your email address information registration process.
  * **Enhancement of Profile Information:** We obtain marketing data from third parties and add it to our existing user database, to better target our advertising and to provide pertinent offers for which we think you would be interested. To enrich our profiles of individual customers, we tie this information to the personal Information you submitted to us. If you choose to link any of your social media accounts to your account, you may be given the option to log into your account using the credentials from any such social media accounts. When you choose to use this log-in feature, we may obtain information from all of the social media accounts that you have chosen to link to your account. Such information may include, for example, your name, date of birth, gender, location, profile photo, interests, activities, likes, check-ins, languages, e-mail address, mailing address, telephone number, professional information, contacts or similar information. You may unlink any of your social media accounts from your account by modifying your account settings. When you do so, we will stop obtaining new information from such social media accounts.
  * **When We Advertise on Third Party Sites:** When you visit a site on which we advertise and click through our advertisement, we may place cookies on your computer or use pixel tags. The information that we collect through this technology is not personally identifiable.



**C. Information Collected Through Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies**

We use tracking technologies to help provide content, to measure promotional effectiveness, to offer advertisements and/or other offerings, to recognize you and your preferences when you return to our site, to help us learn more about how our users use our sites, to personalize your experience, to assess which areas of our site you visit, and to remarket to you after you leave our site.

**Third Party Tracking:** We permit third parties that we have agreements with to track you when you are on our web site. When you leave our web site there is a chance that these third parties may continue to track you.

A few tracking technologies include, without limitation, images, scripts and subsequent technology and methods later developed:

**Cookies:** Edvisors uses “cookies” and other technologies to help us learn more about how our users use our sites and to recognize you when you return. “Cookies” (which may be html files, Flash files or other technology) are text files that are stored on your browser or device by web sites, apps, online media, and advertisements and that can be used to help recognize you as an Edvisors user and help store your preferences and activity. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Cookies may store user preferences and other information, and can be deleted or blocked by changing the settings on your web browser. You may also be able to modify your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis. However, choosing to decline cookies may hinder performance and negatively impact your experience on Edvisors web sites.

**Web Beacons:** Web beacons are small graphic images or other web programming which may be included in our services. Web beacons can be invisible to you and are used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to our Sites, to monitor how users navigate our Sites, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many specific articles or links were actually viewed.

**HTML5 and Locally Stored Objects:** Similar to cookies are “locally stored objects,“ which we may also use for storing analytics information. Locally stored objects, such as HTML5 Web Storage, are used for similar purposes as cookies but typically may contain a greater amount and different types of data than browser cookies. Most current versions of common web browsers clear this locally stored data when you delete or clear your cookie cache. To confirm whether this is the case for the browser you are using, or to learn more about how to precisely control this data storage, please consult the Help function of your browser.

**Analytics Tools and Third Party Cookies:** Edvisors uses temporary cookies to help us determine how people travel through our site. A temporary cookie expires when you close your browser. This web site also uses third-party analytics tools (such as Google Analytics) to collect information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this site. We use this information only to improve this site. Such tools use permanent cookies to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Edvisors. Third-parties providing such analytics tools may also transfer this information to other third-parties where required to do so by law, or where such third-parties process the information on their behalf. The third-party analytics provider cannot associate your IP address with your personally identifiable information. By using this web site, you consent to the processing of data about you by a third-party click tracking analytics provider in the manner and for the purposes set out above.

You can exercise cookie choices by visiting <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>.

For information about how Exchange Solutions uses data when you use our Partner’s sites, please [click here](https://www.exchangesolutions.com/lpost-setup/Use-of-Data-Policy-December-2014.pdf).

We use a web analytics tool that may record mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity as well as any text you type in this website. The tool does not collect personally identifiable information that you do not voluntarily enter in this website. The tool does not track your browsing habits across other web sites.

**Online Advertising Networks and Third Party Cookies:** Edvisors sometimes runs online ad campaigns that display Edvisors ads to you based on your likely interests. We may learn your likely interests when you use our web sites and from other companies and web sites that help us understand your likely interests. These types of ads are often called “interest-based ads” or “online behavioral advertising.” We hire “ad networks” to display these ads on web sites across the Internet. Edvisors Network, Inc., adheres to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.

The ad networks we hire to display these ads set their own cookies on your browser and use web beacons to measure the effectiveness of these ads and to understand your likely interests. Our ad networks and Edvisors both learn which Edvisors ads are shown to you, which ads are clicked on, and on which web page the ads were displayed.

Third-party companies may use non-cookie technologies to recognize your computer or device and/or to collect and record information about your web surfing activity including your activities on this web site. These technologies may be used directly on this web site. Please keep in mind that your web browser may not permit you to block the use of these non-cookie technologies, and those browser settings that block cookies may have no effect on such techniques.

Notwithstanding the above, we may share information collected from you with third party data providers including web log data and/or hashed email addresses. Third party data providers may place anonymous cookies on your browser to receive customized ads or content, which you can opt out of at <http://www.aboutads.info/choices>.

For more general information about interest-based ads and your choices, visit the Digital Advertising Alliance at [http://www.aboutads.info/choices.](http://www.aboutads.info/choices "Digital Advertising Alliance")

**D. How We Respond to Browser “Do Not Track” Signals**

Some web browsers incorporate a “Do Not Track” feature that signals to web sites that you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Each browser communicates “Do Not Track” signals to the actual web site differently making it unworkable to honor each and every request correctly. To alleviate any communication error between browsers and web site, we do not respond to web browser “Do Not Track” signals at this time. As the technology and communication between browser and web site improves, we will reevaluate the ability to honor “Do Not Track” signals and may make changes to our policy.

Go to [http://www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) or [http://www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/ "Digital Advertising Alliance") if you wish to learn more about your options to not accept tracking cookies for the purpose of receiving targeted interest-based advertisements.

### 2\. Children’s Privacy Policy

This web site is not directed or otherwise promoted for use by children under the age of thirteen (13). Edvisors does not knowingly collect, maintain or use personal information from our web sites about children under age thirteen. If a child whom we know to be under age thirteen sends personal information to us online, we will only use that information to respond directly to that child, notify parents or seek parental consent, and will delete such information from our records. If we change our practices in the future, we will obtain prior, verifiable parental consent before collecting any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen. We are not, however, responsible for the collection and use of information by companies or individuals unaffiliated with us whose web sites may contain links to ours. Because we do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen, we also do not knowingly distribute such information to third-parties. We do not knowingly allow children under the age of thirteen to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information via our site.

### 3\. How We Protect Your Information

We take the security of your personal information very seriously, and have implemented policies and procedures designed to safeguard it. Edvisors Network, Inc. maintains physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to help protect our data. To protect your personal information from unauthorized access and use, we have implemented both online and offline security measures such as computer safeguards (firewalls and passwords) and securing servers and buildings where your information is stored. We require all third party advertising and marketing partners with whom we share your information to make reasonable efforts to protect your information, however we "do not guarantee" the security of personal information sold to or shared with third parties.

We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or store on the Service and you do so at your own risk. We also cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

If you are eligible for a survey opportunity, the Third Party MR Company will provide your unique identification number and a survey link to us and we will invite you to participate in the survey. We will not share your name, email address, or phone number with the Third Party MR Companies. In connection with the sharing of your information with a Third Party MR Company, your information may be transferred and stored outside of your country of residence, including, without limitation, in the United States. If you have any questions about this data sharing, you may reach us during regular business hours at (888) 972-1010. Your participation in such survey opportunities does not entitle you to any benefits offered by, or membership with, the Third Party MR Companies.

**Analytics Partners:** We may share your information with third parties who use the information solely for analytical purposes. The third-party analytics provider cannot associate your IP address with your personally identifiable information.

We make certain anonymized or aggregated information (which is information that does not personally identify you) available to third parties, to: (a) comply with various reporting obligations; (b) for business or marketing purposes; or (c) to assist such parties in understanding our users’ interests, habits, and usage patterns for certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality available through the Service.

**Third-Party Service Providers:** From time to time we may use third parties to perform specific services, such as sending emails or newsletters to Edvisors users. If we use a third party to provide specific services, then information (such as contact information) may be shared with that party to the extent necessary for the third party to provide these services. These third-party service providers are only allowed to use personally identifiable information for the purpose of providing the specific services requested by Edvisors. The third-party services covered by this paragraph do not include links to third-party sites found on our sites. These third party links are governed by a more specific provision below.

**Disclosure to Law Enforcement and Similar Disclosures:** While Edvisors strives to protect the personal information of all users, Edvisors will disclose information if legally required to do so, if requested to do so by a government entity, or if it believes in good faith that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect our rights or property or our affiliated companies; (c) prevent a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the public.

**As Part of a Business Transfer:** We may share your information, including your personal information, and usage information with any parent, subsidiary or affiliate entity for the purposes disclosed in this Privacy Policy. We also reserve the right to disclose and transfer some or all such information: (i) to a subsequent owner, co-owner or operator of Edvisors; or (ii) in connection with any merger, acquisition, consolidation, restructuring, bankruptcy, or other corporate change involving us and/or our affiliates. We may transfer the corresponding information regarding our customers and users of the services, including personal information, to third parties evaluating or facilitating the transaction.

Nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to interfere with our ability to transfer all or part of our business, equity interests, or assets (including the services) to an affiliate or non-affiliated third party at any time, for any purpose, without any limitation, and without notice or any compensation to you, whatsoever.

**Promotions:** We may share your information in connection with any promotion you enter on or through the web sites, as necessary to administer, market, sponsor, or fulfill the promotion or as required by applicable laws, rules or regulations (for example, to provide winners’ lists or make required filings as appropriate) or in accordance with the applicable Official Rules of the promotion/sweepstakes you enter.

**Social Media Features:** Our web site may include Social Media features, such as the Facebook “Like” button. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social Media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our web site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them.

**Offer Walls:** Our web sites may display third-party advertisers’ offers. These advertisers may in turn display their own offers. The offers displayed by Edvisors Network, Inc. may allow us to provide points or other virtual currency to users in exchange for interaction with an advertisement or completion of a specific activity in furtherance of the advertiser’s promotion. Such activities may include signing up for an account with the advertiser. These offers are not controlled by or made by Edvisors Network, Inc. These offers may be displayed to you based on certain technical information, such as your geographic area or other anonymous demographic information. After clicking on one of these offers, you may no longer be on a site hosted by Edvisors or a partnering Third Party Platform. To properly credit user accounts and to prevent fraud, a unique identifier and anonymous demographic information may be shared with the offer provider. This information is used to ensure proper crediting of your account, prevent fraud or duplicate offers and to resolve any customer service inquiries that may arise. Once you complete an offer, you may then be returned to an Edvisors website or service.

**We May Also Share Information with Third Parties Subject to Your Consent.**

**Your California Privacy Rights: A Notice to California Users (California Civil Code Section 1798.83)**

California's "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California residents asking about the business' practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. Alternately, businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of California residents to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes if the California resident has exercised an option to opt out of such information-sharing. We have such a policy in place.

Any California residents who have an established relationship with Edvisors may opt out of Edvisors disclosing your personal information with third parties for direct marketing purposes. Under California law, third parties include affiliates of Edvisors. If you do not want Edvisors to disclose your personal information to third parties, including affiliates, you can [opt out here](https://web.archive.org/third-party-opt-out/).

Pursuant to California privacy law, registered users under 18 years of age may request to have content or information posted by the user removed from any of our online platforms. In order to effectuate removal of such content or information, you may reach us during regular business hours at (888) 972-1010.

The removal of content does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information posted on any of our online platforms by the registered user.

We do not advertise or market any of the products or services identified in Chapter 22.1 Sec. 22580 (i) to users we have actual knowledge are under 18 years of age.
