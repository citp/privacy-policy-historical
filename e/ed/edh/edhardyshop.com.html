		<h1><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></h1>
		<p>Published July 18th, 2014</p>
		<p>
		This privacy policy applies only to the website owned, operated and maintained by Delivery Agent, Inc. (“DA”) and Musictoday, LLC (“MT”) (collectively referred to as the “Parties”, "we" or "us") where this privacy
		policy is posted (collectively, the "Site"). This privacy policy does not pertain to information that is collected offline. BY USING THE SITE, YOU CONSENT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND TO OUR 
		PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSES STATED BELOW. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SITE.
		</p><br>
		<h3><strong>A. Information Collected</strong></h3>
		<p>
		This privacy policy applies only to information collected on the Site and does not apply to information collected by us through any other means.   We collect the information you provide to us actively, and 
		also collect information automatically from the devices that interact with our Site, as explained below.
		</p>
		<p>(1) Information You Actively Provide</p>
		<p>
		"We collect registration details and personal information, such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, age, gender, payment details, purchase history, or company name, that you actively provide 
		to us when you register, communicate, or transact business with our Site.
		</p>
		<p>
		We receive and store the information that you enter on our Site or give to us in any other way.  The above list provides an example of the personally identifiable information that may be collected on the Site. 
		If you do not want us to collect your personally identifiable information, please do not provide it to us.
		</p>
		<p>(2) Information Collected From or About the Devices that Interact with our Site</p>
		<p>
		We receive and store information from and about the devices (such computers, smartphones) that interact with our device, including the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; 
		your login credentials; and computer and connection information such as browser type, version, and time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system, and platform.  We use cookies, web beacons, 
		and other technologies to measure and collect session information, including page response times, and to measure and understand visitor behaviors on the site.  We may also collect technical information to help us 
		identify your device for reasons of security and site integrity.  
		</p>
		<h3><strong>B. Use of Information Collected Via the Site</strong></h3>
		<p>(1) We use the information that you actively provide</p>
		<ul>
			<li>To deliver services, such as educational programs, information, newsletters or software you request or purchase;</li>
			<li>To alert you to special offers, updated information and other new services from us, or other third parties, or to forward promotional materials;</li>
			<li>To complete a transaction or service requested by you;</li>
			<li>To fulfill the terms of a promotion;</li>
			<li>To ensure the Site are relevant to your needs;</li>
			<li>To help us create and publish content most relevant to you;</li>
			<li>To notify you about a material change to this privacy policy or the Visitor Agreement, if necessary;</li>
			<li>To allow you access to limited-entry areas of the Site; and</li>
			<li>To contact you in response to sign up forms such as Contact Us or Order Inquiry.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3><strong>C. Sharing and Disclosure of Information</strong></h3>
		<p>We may share or disclose the information you provide, including name and contact details in the following instances:</p>
		<p>
		(i) To fulfill a service to you. For example, if you choose to watch an educational program on the Site, we may share your personally identifiable information in order to provide the program to you. In addition, 
		if you email us a question, we may use your email address to process your request and respond to your question. Also, if you are entering a sweepstakes or contest, we may use your personally identifiable information 
		in order to fulfill the terms of that promotion. This means that we may share the information for prize fulfillment purposes or mail carriers. We also may share your information with the co-sponsor of that promotion.
		</p>
		<p>
		(ii) To affiliates, strategic partners, agents, third party marketers or other unaffiliated parties who are offering products or services that we believe may be of interest to you or who require your personally 
		identifiable information for research, administrative and/or internal business purposes. These parties may use your personally identifiable information to contact you with an offer or advertisement related to a 
		product or service, or they may use such information for their own research, administration or business purposes. If you do not want us to share your personally identifiable information in this manner, please do 
		not provide us with this information.
		</p>
		<p>
		(iii) To unaffiliated third-party service providers, agents or independent contractors who help us maintain our Site and provide other administrative services to us (including, but not limited to, order processing 
		and fulfillment, providing customer service, maintaining and analyzing data, sending customer communications on our behalf, and entry collection, winner selection and prize fulfillment for contests, sweepstakes and 
		other promotions). We seek to ensure that these unaffiliated third parties will not use the personally identifiable information for any other purpose than to provide the administrative services for which they are 
		responsible. Because such unaffiliated third-party service providers that help us administer our Site will have access to users' personally identifiable information, if you do not wish for our unaffiliated third-party 
		service providers to have access to your information, please do not register or submit any personally identifiable information to us.
		</p>
		<p>
		(iv) To complete your purchase. If you choose to make a purchase on the Site, we may collect from you your credit card number, billing address and other information related to such purchase, and we may use such 
		collected information in order to fulfill your purchase. We may also provide such information, or other personally identifiable information provided by you, to unaffiliated third parties as necessary to complete 
		your purchase (for example, to process your credit card).
		</p>
		<p>
		(v) To comply with the law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the requirements of law or comply with legal process served on us, protect and defend our rights or property 
		or act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of our end users.
		</p>
		<p>(vi) To third parties as part of any corporate reorganization process including, but not limited to, mergers, acquisitions, and sales of all or substantially all of our assets.</p>
		<p>(vii) To track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers and provide such information to third parties.</p>
		<p>
		(viii) To protect against potential fraud, we may verify with third parties the information collected from these Site. In the course of such verification, we may receive personally identifiable information
		about you from such services. In particular, if you use a credit card or debit card to purchase services with us, we may use card authorization and fraud screening services to verify that your card information 
		and address matches the information that you supplied to us, and that the card has not been reported as lost or stolen.
		</p>
		<p>Except as described in this Privacy Policy or at the time we request the information, we do not otherwise use, share or otherwise disclose your name and contact or payment details to any third parties.</p>
		<h3><strong>D. Online Tracking / Third Party Advertising</strong></h3>
		<p>
		We use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies for analytics and advertising purposes.  When you interact with our Site, interest-based ads may be displayed to you based upon information such as 
		purchasing or browsing behaviors on our Site.  These tracking technologies enable us to identify the ads you see, whether you click on them, and other actions you take on our Site, so that we can tailor advertising, 
		including for example avoiding repetition of ad content.   We do not use personal information, such as name or contact details, to tailor advertising.
		</p>
		<p>
		We may use advertisers, third party ad networks, and other advertising companies, to serve advertisements on the Site. Please be advised that such advertising companies may gather information about your visit 
		to the Site or other sites (such as through cookies, web beacons and other technologies) to enable such advertising companies to market products or services to you, to monitor which ads have been served to your 
		browser and which webpages you were viewing when such ads were delivered.   These advertisers may read and place cookies on our Site, but they do not have access to personal information such as name or contact 
		details.
		</p>
		<p>
		Our Site, whether accessed on a computer or a mobile device, is not at this time configured to read or respond to “do not track” settings or signals in your browser headings, which vary by browser provider.  
		In lieu of a browser-based opt-out solution, users can utilize the Digital Advertising Alliance and other approved methods for placement of “opt-out” cookies.  Our site and those of our third party advertisers 
		or other vendors are configured to read and honor these opt-out cookies, so long as they are present on your computer. (If you delete all cookies, you will need to reset your opt-out cookies.)  Specific instructions 
		on how to do so follow.  However, please be aware that we do not control these opt-out processes.
		</p>

		<h3><strong>E. Children</strong></h3>
		<p>
		The features, programs, promotions and other aspects of this Site requiring personally identifiable information are not intended for children.  We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from 
		children under the age of thirteen (13).  If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of thirteen (13) and believe he or she has disclosed personally identifiable information to us, please contact us at
		<a href="mailto:storesupport@deliveryagent.com">storesupport@deliveryagent.com</a>.  A parent or guardian of a child under the age of thirteen (13) may review and request deletion of such child’s personally identifiable 
		information as well as prohibit the use thereof.

		<h3><strong>F. International Transfer of Information</strong></h3>
		<p>
		If you choose to provide us with personally identifiable information, we may transfer that information to its affiliates and subsidiaries or to other third parties, across borders, and from your country or 
		jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are visiting from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please 
		note that you are transferring your personally identifiable information to the United States which does not have the same data protection laws as the EU and by providing your personally identifiable information 
		you consent to:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The use of your personally identifiable information for the uses identified above in accordance with this privacy policy; and</li>
			<li>The transfer of your personally identifiable information to the United States as indicated above.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3><strong>G. Opt-Out</strong></h3>
		<p>
		We communicate with users who subscribe to our services on a regular basis via email. For example, we may use your email address to confirm your request, to send you notice of payments, to send you information 
		about changes to our products and services, and to send notices and other disclosures as required by law. Generally, users cannot opt-out of these communications, but they will be primarily informational in nature
		rather than promotional. However, we provide you the opportunity to exercise an opt-out choice if you do not want to receive other types of communication from us, such as emails or updates from us regarding new 
		services and products offered on this Site or if you do not want us to share your personally identifiable information with third parties. The opt-out choice may be exercised by ticking or un-ticking the appropriate
		box if such checkbox is available at the points where personally identifiable information is collected or by contacting us. We will process your unsubscribe as soon as possible, but please be aware that in some 
		circumstances you may receive a few more messages until the unsubscribe is processed. You also may opt-out of receiving such emails by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link within the text of the email.
		</p>
		<h3><strong>H. Forums, Chat Rooms, and Other Public Posting Areas</strong></h3>
		<p>
		Please note that any information you include in a message you post to any chat room, forum or other public posting area is available to anyone with Internet access. If you don't want people to know your e-mail 
		address, for example, don't include it in any message you post publicly. PLEASE BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL WHEN DISCLOSING ANY INFORMATION IN CHAT ROOMS, FORUMS AND OTHER PUBLIC POSTING AREAS. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR 
		THE USE BY OTHERS OF THE INFORMATION THAT YOU DISCLOSE IN CHAT ROOMS, FORUMS AND OTHER PUBLIC POSTING AREAS.
