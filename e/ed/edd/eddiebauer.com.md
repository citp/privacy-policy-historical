###  Overview

In 1920, Eddie Bauer wrote his business creed, a statement explaining the services he'd provide for his customers. We still follow this same creed today: "To give you such outstanding quality, value, service and guarantee that we may be worthy of your high esteem." Here at Eddie Bauer, we take this promise seriously and we firmly believe in your privacy and the security of your personal information. We are committed to using any information you give us in a responsible manner. You're very important to us and we want to provide you with a safe and secure online experience.

###  What information does Eddie Bauer collect about me?

We may collect different kinds of information from or about you:

  * Information you provide:  When you purchase from Eddie Bauer or request a catalog, we collect information that you volunteer: your name, email address, postal address, phone number, payment information, and other information necessary to process your order or send you the catalog. We also collect the information you provide to us when you register for "My Account," participate in a contest or sweepstakes promotion, fill out a survey or questionnaire, or contact us (for example via email, "Ask Eddie" or "Live Chat"). The information you supply to us is added to our customer database.
  * Information about use of our website: Every time you visit our website, we automatically collect your Internet service provider's address, the Web page from which you came, and a record of your activity on our site. We may gather some of this information automatically.
  * Information about visits to retail locations: We use mobile location analytics technology at our U.S. retail spaces to gain aggregate insights about customer behavior. The data collected is anonymous and works by sensing the presence of Wi-Fi enabled devices. This technology collects and hashes Media Access Control (MAC) addresses from Wi-Fi enabled devices that come in contact with our network equipment. In addition, this technology collects signal strength, time and date, the manufacturer of the device, and the name of a Wi-Fi network currently connected to the device, if applicable. A MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to every mobile device and is not the device's phone number. Collection of mobile location information only occurs when a device's Wi-Fi setting is turned on.
  * Information from third parties: We may collect information from third parties, including business partners and marketing agencies. This may include your contact information from marketing partners when we engage in joint marketing or co-branding activities, your IP address or location information from service providers to offer certain products and services relevant to you or your location, and data from your social networks to authenticate your product use with us, or that you grant permission to our products or services to access.



We may combine information we collect in different ways, and combine it in your customer profile.

###  Companies other than Eddie Bauer

Our privacy policy does not apply to companies other than Eddie Bauer. Companies other than Eddie Bauer are sometimes identified on our website, catalog or marketing materials. If you make a purchase from another company's catalog or website, the information you provide to that company, such as your credit card number and contact information, is provided to that company and not to Eddie Bauer. Providing this information to the company enables your transaction with the other company to take place. However, you should know that the company may, if you do not advise them to the contrary, share your name and postal and email addresses with third parties, including Eddie Bauer. You should also know that these companies have their own privacy and data collection practices and are not covered by the Eddie Bauer privacy statement. We are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by those third parties, nor are we responsible for the information or content their products and services contain.

For more information, including privacy policies, regarding such companies please see that company's home page and click on their Information link; or review the customer service section of any catalog you may receive from that company.

###  California Privacy Rights

If you are a California resident, California law permits you to request information regarding the disclosure of your personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. You may [contact us](https://web.archive.org/custserv/ask-eddie-email.jsp) to exercise your rights. If you are a California resident under the age of 18, and you are a registered user of our products or services, California law permits you to request and obtain removal of content or information you have publicly posted.

###  How is my information protected?

We have implemented physical, technological, and organizational safeguards and security measures designed to protect against the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access or disclosure of your personal information under our control. We also take measures to protect the personal information we disclose to third parties, for example by entering into contractual agreements stipulating the confidentiality of the information and the purposes for which it is to be used. Please be aware that, despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. You can help us by protecting and keeping your passwords safe at all times, and not using the same password for different applications or sites. You also can protect yourself and help us reduce the risk of fraud by promptly notifying us if you suspect that your credit card, user name or password is lost, stolen or used without permission. In the event of a security breach, we will promptly notify you and the proper authorities if required by law.

We will retain your personal information for as long as it is necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Statement, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

###  How to Report Fraud

You can help us identify attempts at fraud.

Eddie Bauer will never ask you for sensitive personal information in an email.

If you receive a suspicious email appearing to come from Eddie Bauer, such as one requesting that you confirm personal information like your credit card number, or if you have received an email implying that it has been sent by Eddie Bauer after you have Opted Out of receipt of Eddie Bauer emails, you may forward the suspicious email to [abuse@eddiebauer.com.](mailto:abuse@eddiebauer.com)

You should not respond directly to suspicious email. And do not click on or open any hyperlink embedded in the suspicious email.

There are a few common features of fraudulent emails that can help you identify them as spam. The two most frequent are:

  1. receiving an email that contains mistakes such as misspelled words or grammatical errors, and
  2. receiving an email that asks for your confidential information or asks you to take immediate action on your account.



We encourage all of our customers to protect themselves and their information:

  1. do not share your credentials or account information with any third party, and
  2. make sure that your system is properly patched, running anti-virus and a personal firewall.



If you have already provided information in response to a suspicious email that appeared to have been sent by Eddie Bauer, you may report the suspicious email by forwarding it to [abuse@eddiebauer.com.](mailto:abuse@eddiebauer.com)

For more information on how to protect yourself and your personal information, you can visit the antiphishing Working Group's website at [http://www.antiphishing.org/consumer_recs.html](https://www.antiphishing.org/resources/overview/). 

Thank you for helping us monitor and prevent fraud.

###  Children's Policy

We do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose information from children under 18. If we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under 18 we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible. Please immediately [contact us](https://web.archive.org/custserv/ask-eddie-email.jsp) if you become aware that a child under 18 has provided us with personal information.

###  Changes to this Privacy Statement

We may periodically change this Privacy Statement and expect most changes to be minor. Any non-material changes will take effect immediately upon posting of an updated Privacy Statement. For any significant changes to the Privacy Statement, we will provide you with a prominent notice of such changes.
