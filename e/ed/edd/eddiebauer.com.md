We use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving your personal information. On the Internet, when you see either a solid key icon or a locked padlock icon at the lower portion of your browser window, this indicates that the site is secured through Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). Pages requesting personal information should always have one of these icons. If you do not see one of these icons, please contact us to complete your transaction over the phone by calling 1-800-426-8020. When you apply on-line for an Eddie Bauer Charge Card, we will direct you to the World Financial Network Bank (WFNNB) website. See the WFNNB website for information on its privacy statement. 

###  How to Report Fraud

You can help us identify attempts at fraud.

Eddie Bauer will never ask you for sensitive personal information in an email.

You should not respond directly to suspicious email. And do not click on or open any hyperlink embedded in the suspicious email.

There are a few common features of fraudulent emails that can help you identify them as spam. The two most frequent are:  
a) receiving an email that contains mistakes such as misspelled words or grammatical errors, and  
b) receiving an email that asks for your confidential information or asks you to take immediate action on your account.  


We encourage all of our customers to protect themselves and their information:  
a) do not share your credentials or account information with any third party, and  
b) make sure that your system is properly patched, running anti-virus and a personal firewall.  


If you have already provided information in response to a suspicious email that appeared to have been sent by Eddie Bauer, you may report the suspicious email by forwarding it to [abuse@eddiebauer.com](mailto:abuse@eddiebauer.com).
