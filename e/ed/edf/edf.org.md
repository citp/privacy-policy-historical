## All the details

When you register for special services on one of our sites, you give us personal information about yourself (such as name, address, zip code, email address, etc.). You can always [opt out](https://web.archive.org/about/this-site/privacy#optout), now or at any time later, to keep from getting any unwanted messages or solicitations.

If you have any questions, [please ask](https://web.archive.org/contact).

### **1\. What personally identifiable information of yours is collected?**

This means information that identifies you, such as your name, phone number, email address, mailing address, or even credit card number (if you use a credit card to make a donation).

If you visit our sites to read or download information, such as consumer brochures or press releases, we collect and store only the following non-personally identifying information about you: the name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for example, aol.com, if you are connecting from an America Online account, or princeton.edu if you are connecting from Princeton University’s domain); the date and time you access our site; which pages you visit; and the Internet address of the web site from which you may have linked directly to our site.

If you ask for one of our many personalized or enhanced services, we will ask you to provide us with personally identifiable information. For example, if you wish to contact your representative in Congress, we will ask for your address so that we can direct your communication to the correct member of Congress. We also keep a record of faxes and e-mails you send from our system, as well as your comments.

We want to be very clear: We only obtain this kind of personally-identifying information when you choose to provide it.

### **3\. How your information may be used**

We use your personal information to give you personalized service (for example, information about your neighborhood, or your favorite subjects); to send you email alerts; to answer your requests; to let you become a member online, to better understand demographic information about our supporters and website visitors, and to customize your online experience. Our overriding goal in our use of your personal information is to better serve you and our other supporters and website visitors and to advance our environmental advocacy goals. You can [opt out](https://web.archive.org/about/this-site/privacy#optout) at any time to stop any further contact from us.

We also use it to track use of our web sites; this lets us see which of our features are the most popular so we can better serve our users’ needs. This also lets us provide aggregate data about our traffic (not identifying you personally, but showing how many visitors used which features, for example) to outside parties. Also see, “How ‘cookies’ are used.”

We may also use this information to suggest other web site services to you, ask you to become a member of EDF, or to solicit donations. At any time you can [opt out](https://web.archive.org/about/this-site/privacy#optout), so that we will not contact you by email, mail or telephone.

We may share your personally-identifiable information, as well as a record of transactions you conduct with us, with third-party advertising and analytics partners and related service providers. We do so in order to deliver information about our work and your opportunity to support it through a variety of communication channels, including online advertising, social media messages, email messages, and offline communications. Our advertising partners will make the data we provide anonymous. To learn more about the use of this information or to make choices about receiving personalized advertising on other sites, please visit the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices).
