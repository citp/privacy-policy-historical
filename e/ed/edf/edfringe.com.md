# Privacy policy | Edinburgh Festival Fringe

The Edinburgh Festival Fringe website ([www.edfringe.com](http://www.edfringe.com/), including, without limitation, [tickets.edfringe.com](http://tickets.edfringe.com/), [edfringe.com/shop](http://www.edfringe.com/shop), [registration.edfringe.com](http://registration.edfringe.com/), [www.fringeworldcongress.co.uk](http://www.fringeworldcongress.co.uk/), [www.worldfringeday.com](http://www.worldfringeday.com/)  and other websites owned or controlled by us, from time to time)  (the "Website") and the Fringe mobile app for iPhone and Android (the "App") are maintained by the Edinburgh Festival Fringe Society, a company limited by guarantee and incorporated in Scotland (No SC 046605, Registered Charity No SC 002995) which sells tickets for the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, and the Festival Fringe Trading Limited, trading as Edinburgh Festival Fringe Shop, incorporated in Scotland (No SC 130813, VAT registration number 171 276 804) which sells goods.  Please remember that throughout the terms that follow, when we mention ‘we’, ‘us’, ‘our’, etc, we mean Edinburgh Festival Fringe Society Limited ("EFFS") and/or Festival Fringe Trading Limited ("FFTL") (as applicable). When we refer to ‘you’ we mean the user and/or browser of the Website or App and those persons, organisations or companies registering a show for the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.

Our principal place of business is at 180 High Street, Edinburgh, EH1 1QS. You can email us at [admin@edfringe.com](mailto:admin@edfringe.com).  The main telephone number for our office is 0131 226 0026.

FFTL is the data controller in respect of the collection of personal information relating to the purchase of goods from the Website, and EFFS is the data controller in respect of all other personal information collected including the purchase of tickets. Both can be contacted at the address above.

#### What information do we collect?

You are not required to provide any personal information in order to access the majority of the content available on the Website or App. We do, however, require you to supply certain personal details when you register with us or make a purchase from the Website or App, in order to process your transaction and/or fulfil your order. This information includes;, name, address, email address and payment details.

We will also collect and process any personal data supplied by you in connection with your use of [registration.edfringe.com](http://registration.edfringe.com/) when registering a show at the Festival Fringe (for further information on this, please see the "How will my data be used when registering for a show?" section of this policy).

To become a member of the Fringe Society we require your name, address and contact information as set out in our forms, which will be stored on our secure server and used to send your essential election communications.

We will also ask you for information when you enter a competition or promotion sponsored by us and if you report a problem with the Website; typically your name and contact information that you supply us with, such as your email address or phone number.

We may also collect information about your computer, the mobile telephone and/or handheld device on which you are using the App or Website, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, mobile network information as well as the mobile telephone or handheld device's telephone number, for system administration and to report aggregate information about users' browsing actions and patterns (from which users cannot be identified).

In respect of users of the App and mobile website, we will also collect details of your network-based location in order to enable the "Near me now" (and/or any other, similar location services) and map functions which show you which shows are on near your current location.

We may also collect other information provided by you at the time of registering to use the App. 

#### Where will we store your information?

The data that we collect from you may be stored on our secure servers and, in respect of payment data, on those of our third party provider of payment processing services purely for the purposes of processing payment.   The data we collect from you may be processed by staff who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the hosting of the Website and App and/ or provision of support services.  By submitting your personal data, you agree to this storing and/ or processing.  We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.

When you are purchasing tickets through the App or tickets and/or goods through the Website we will store your personal data (including, for the avoidance of doubt, your payment details) under your account for any future payment made by you in relation to tickets and/or goods. Your payment details will be stored by our payment processing provider in the form of an encrypted token and processed by our payment processing provider only where you purchase tickets and/or goods. You can choose to remove any stored payment details from the App or Website, at any time, by selecting the " _Remove Card as a Payment Option_ " option under your account.

The token containing your payment details remains (in its encrypted format) within our payment processing provider's secure network, in compliance with data protection legislation and any other applicable laws, regulations or standards, until it expires (cancellation or expiration of card) as dictated by the payment processing provider.  Your payment details (on the Website or App) are stored as a secure encrypted token within the payment processing system for the purpose of ‘one-click’ payment processing. Payment details stored for the purpose of ‘one-click’ purchasing on our Website or App are processed by staff or suppliers in its encrypted format only and it is not possible for any staff or supplier to revert tokens back to live data. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the Website or App; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

#### How will we use your information?

The legal basis upon which we rely for using information held about you is primarily for the performance of a contract between us, or in anticipation of entering into a contract with us, e.g. to provide you with products and services that you have asked for. This includes:

  * carrying out our obligations arising from contracts entered into with between you and us; and
  * providing services you rely on from our Website and our App, such as interactive features of our Website or App, when you choose to do so.



We also will use information held about you for the purposes of our legitimate interests insofar as there is a relationship between us. We have set out in this Privacy Policy other specific instances when we use your information, but in general terms. This will include the following uses:

  * to ensure that content from the Website and App is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer, mobile telephone and/or handheld device;
  * to provide you with essential information about products and services you have requested from us, such as changes to your show information, cancellations and refund services;
  * to provide you with marketing updates and communications relating to  products or services that you request from us or which we feel may interest you (including content and advertising tailored to your interests), but only where you have expressly consented to be contacted for such purposes;
  * to notify you about changes to our service that may affect you;
  * to allow you to vote in Fringe Society elections (managed by ERS) and, if you have chosen to do so, to allow candidates to canvas directly to you;
  * to maintain and keep updated the Website, and the App (including by viewing any personal data held on the Website and/or App in respect of you) and to transfer and process that information for the purpose of organising, co-ordinating, advertising and marketing shows and/or the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. From time to time, we rely on third party suppliers to perform these activities on our behalf.



If you do not provide us with your information, we may not be able to provide services to you. We will let you know about this at the appropriate time.

We have an annual programme of research to help us understand our audiences and your experience of attending the Fringe.  This includes (but is not limited to) an online survey.  All bookers will be invited to participate in the research but are under no obligation to take part.  Full details of the processes are provided when you are invited to participate.  All research is carried out according to Market Research Society guidelines.

#### Will we disclose the information we collect to outside parties?

We will not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others unless you have given us your permission. With your permission we will only share your information with carefully chosen, reputable and trustworthy third parties. We do provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related Website information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information.  We may disclose your personal information to third parties:

  * where we have engaged suppliers to provide services to us to act on our behalf, and we will give you details of this as appropriate in this Privacy Policy;
  * if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation;
  * in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets;
  * if EFFS or FFTL or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets;
  * in order to enforce or apply our [Terms and Conditions](https://www.edfringe.com/information/terms-and-conditions) and other agreements; or
  * to protect the rights, property or safety of us, our members or others.



This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction. In the instance of stored payment details, we will send your data to our payment processing provider for encryption. The encrypted token is stored within our payment processing provider's secure network in compliance with data protection legislation and any other applicable laws, regulations or standards. When a payment request is made against this encrypted token we will send a request for confirmation of payment to the payment processing provider for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction. The encrypted token will be processed only where you purchase tickets and/or goods.   Where you are a foreign national we may provide the UK Border Agency with confirmation of your nationality, passport/identity card numbers and other personal information relating to you that has been collected or processed when registering for a show.

#### How will my data be used when registering for a show?

Where your details are stored on the system and you are linked to a particular organisation, venue or show, the administrators of that organisation, venue or show may be able to see your name and contact details.  In addition, except where you have opted for your profile to be private (which you can do during the registration process (or at any other time by going to the edit profile page) by answering the following question in the affirmative 'Click here if you would like to opt out of appearing in the contact searches?'), all other users of the system will be able to:

#### What are cookies?

A cookie is a small amount of data sent to your computer, mobile phone or handheld device from a website. This means the website can recognise your device (your computer, mobile phone or handheld device) if you return to the same site.

A cookie often includes a unique identifier, which is a randomly generated number. This is stored on your device's hard drive (cache). Many cookies are automatically deleted after you finish using a website.

Cookies are not programs and do not collect information from your device.

Cookies make your experience of using websites faster and easier. They allow websites to create a customised view of pages to which you navigate. For example, they are commonly used to authenticate or identify registered users of a website without requiring them to sign in each time they access it. Other uses include maintaining a ‘shopping basket’ of goods a user has chosen to purchase, site personalisation (presenting different pages to different users) and tracking the pages a user has visited on a site for analysis purposes.

Cookies may come with or without an expiry date. Cookies without an expiry date exist until the browser is closed, while cookies with an expiry date may be stored by the device until the expiry date passes.

You can restrict or block cookies set by the Website but this may limit your use of some functionality.

We use third-party suppliers who also set cookies on our behalf to deliver the services that they are providing or to record usage.

#### How to manage your cookies

Cookies are sent to your browser (whether you use Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Safari or any other browser) by a website and then stored in the cookies directory of your device.

To check and update your cookies settings, you will need to know what browser you are using and what version of it you have. You can usually find this out by opening the browser (just as if you were going to use the internet) and then clicking on ‘Help’ and then ‘About’. This will give you information about the browser version you are using.

To find out how to allow, block, delete and manage the cookies on all standard web browsers, go to [www.aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/) and select the browser and version you are using. You'll also find information about how to delete cookies from your computer. For the majority of browsers this can be done through your preferences control panel.
