<a name="what"></a><b>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;What Personally Identifiable Information of Yours is Collected?</b>
</p><p>
This means information that tells us something about who you are, such as your name, phone number, email address, mailing address, or even credit card number (if you use a credit card to make a donation). 
</p><p>
If you visit our sites to read or download information, such as consumer brochures or press releases, we collect and store only the following information about you: the name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for example, aol.com, if you are connecting from an America Online account, or princeton.edu if you are connecting from Princeton University's domain); the date and time you access our site; and the Internet address of the web site from which you may have linked directly to our site.
</p><p>
If you ask for one of our many personalized or enhanced services, we will ask you to provide us with personally identifiable information. On our Scorecard web site, it might be your zip code, so we can guide you to information about your local neighborhood. In other cases you might be asked for your name, address, etc. as part of registering to use Action Network, 
to become a member, or to use other services. We want to be very clear: we will not obtain this kind of personally-identifying information about you when you visit our site, unless you choose to provide it to us. See <a href="#how">How Your Information May Be Used</a>.

<a name="whatorg"></a><b>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;What Organization is Collecting Your Information?</b>

</p><p>We are Environmental Defense, a non-profit, tax-deductible environmental advocacy and research organization, and Environmental Defense Action Fund, a non-profit, non-tax-deductible environmental advocacy and research organization. Environmental Defense and Environmental Defense Action Fund are affiliated organizations. We are responsible for any information collected on our web sites. Our organizational site is <a href="http://www.environmentaldefense.org" target="new">www.environmentaldefense.org</a>.  In addition, we sponsor:

</p><ul type="disc">
  <li><b><a href="http://www.scorecard.org" target="new">Scorecard</a></b>, a comprehensive online tool for monitoring and taking action on chemical releases and other forms of pollution nationwide;  
  </li><li><a href="http://www.hogwatch.org" target="new"><b>Hog Watch</b></a>, a clearinghouse and advocacy site focused on environmental threats from factory farming in the U.S.;  
  </li><li><b><a href="http://www.actionnetwork.org" target="new">Environmental Defense's Action Network</a>, </b>an online activist tool to influence policy (parts of which are operated by <b><a href="#otherorgs">other organizations</a></b>); 
  </li><li><b><a href="http://www.getgreen.org" target="new">GetGreen</a></b>, which features tips on how to save money while saving the environment;

  </li><li><a href="http://www.texasep.org" target="new"><b>Texas Environmental Profiles</b></a>, where the Texas Center for Policy Studies joins with Environmental Defense to present rankings of air, water, land use and energy issues in the Lone Star State.
  </li><li><a href="http://www.undoit.org" target="_blank">Undoit.org</a>, a Web site dedicated to informing the public about the consequences of global warming and the steps we can take to not just stop global warming, but to undo it. 
</li></ul>
<p>
<a name="otherorgs"></a><b>Action Network</b> sites operated by other organizations are governed by their own privacy policies. Each Action Network site operates independently, and no information is shared between them.


</p><p>
[<a href="#top">top</a>]
</p><p>
<a name="how"></a><b>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;How Your Information May Be Used</b>
</p><p>
We use your personal information to be able to give you personalized service (for example, information about your neighborhood, or your favorite subjects); to send you email alerts; to answer your requests; to let you become a member online, etc. You can easily opt-out at any time, to stop any further contact from us.
</p><p>
We also use it to track your and others' use of our web sites; this lets us see which of our features are the most popular so we can better serve our users' needs. Our Scorecard site does not collect personal information about you if you are simply visiting the site; if you want to use the site's action tools (i.e., sending faxes or e-mails or posting messages in the discussion forum), or if you want to personalize Scorecard (to control how pages are displayed). Scorecard collects your name, address and phone number (optional) on its registration page.  It saves this information to its user database and writes a "cookie" to your browser so that you will not have to reenter this information when you revisit Scorecard.  This data is kept for authentication purposes and to give you access to messages you have created.  We also keep a record of faxes and e-mails you send from our system, as well as all forum postings.  It also lets us provide aggregate data about our traffic (not identifying you personally, but showing how many visitors used which features, for example) to outside parties. See <a href="#cookies">How "Cookies" Are Used</a>.
</p><p>
We may also use this information to suggest other web site services to you, ask you to become a member of Environmental Defense, or to solicit donations. At any time you can opt-out, so that we will not contact you by email, mail, fax, or telephone.
</p><p>
[<a href="#top">top</a>]
</p><p>
<b><a name="choices"></a>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;What Choices Are Available to You Regarding Collection, Use, and Distribution 
of Your Information?</b>
</p><p>
Now, or at any time in the future, you can correct or update information about you, and you can tell us not to send you any messages or solicitations at all.
</p><p>
[<a href="#top">top</a>]
</p><p>
<a name="security"></a><b>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;What Kind of Security Procedures Are In Place to Protect Against the Loss, Misuse, or Alteration of Your Information?</b>
</p><p>We store your personally identifiable information on secure servers. We also use other "anti-hacking" security measures and employ security consultants. We accept credit card donations only via a secure server. 
</p><p>
[<a href="#top">top</a>]
</p><p>
<a name="access"></a><b>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;How You Can Access, Update, or Delete Your Information</b>
</p><p>
Please contact our <a href="javascript:openWin('privacy')">Privacy Manager</a> to obtain, change, update or delete our records of your personal information, or to change your privacy options.
</p><p>
[<a href="#top">top</a>]
</p><p>
<a name="cookies"></a><b>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;How "Cookies" Are Used</b>
</p><p>
Some of our web sites use "cookie" messages to automatically help provide better services. They remind us who you are and how you like to use our web site, based on what you've done and told us before. The "cookie" is placed in your computer and is read when you come back to our web site. Cookies let us take you to the information and features you're particularly interested in. They also let us track your and others' usage, so we know which parts of our sites are most popular. You can reject cookies or very easily cancel them later.
</p><p>
WebTrends Live is used to analyze traffic to this web site. WebTrends Live does not create individual profiles for visitors. Unlike some tracking services, WebTrends Live does not have a database of individual profiles for each visitor; WebTrends Live only collects aggregate data. For more information about WebTrends Live's privacy policy, please click <a href="http://www.webtrendslive.com/privacy_policy.htm" target="new">here</a>.
</p><p>
If you would like your browser to reject cookies, you can instruct your browser to do so although some features (such as posting to Scorecard's discussion forum) would be unavailable.

<a name="changes"></a><b>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in Our Privacy Policy</b>
</p><p>
Should our practices change, this notice will be immediately updated. Regardless of later updates, we will never use the
information you submit under this current notice in a new way (in a way not described in this notice) without first providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prevent that use. See <a href="#terms">Official Terms and Conditions</a> of using our web sites.
