          example, aol.com, if you are connecting from an America Online account, 
          or princeton.edu if you are connecting from Princeton University's domain); 
          the date and time you access our site; and the Internet address of the

          one of our many personalized or enhanced services, we will ask you to 
          provide us with personally identifiable information. On our Scorecard 
          website, it might be your zip code, so we can guide you to information 
          about your local neighborhood. In other cases you might be asked for 
          your name, address, etc. as part of registering to use Action Network, 
          to become a member, or to use other services<b>. </b>We want to be very 
          clear: we will not obtain this kind of personally-identifying information
