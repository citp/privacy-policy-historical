The Exvo.com website, as well as Exvo.com services such as the Exvo Store, allows you to create an Exvo Account based on your personal information. This convenient service saves you time and allows for easier use of our web services.

This is how it works: You create a personal profile â€” providing your email address, and in some cases your name, phone number, mailing address and/or a credit card number â€” and choose a password. The system saves your information and assigns you a personal Exvo Account â€” in many cases simply your email address, because itâ€™s unique and easy to remember.

The next time you order from the Exvo Store or register for a new product, all you need to do is enter your Exvo Account and password; the system looks up the information it needs to assist you. In addition, if you update the information associated with your Exvo Account it will be available for all your transactions with Exvo.com globally.

Exvo.com also enables you to forward information to family members, friends or colleagues. To fulfill your request, Exvo.com may require personal information about the person to whom you are sending the product or service such as their name, physical address, email address, and so on.
