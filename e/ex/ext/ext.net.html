<p>Ext.NET, Inc., and its affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively “Ext.NET”) recognize the importance
of keeping the personal information you provide to us private and secure. Ext.NET has developed a
comprehensive privacy policy and we use the latest technology to ensure that your personal
information is secure.</p>
<section>
<header>
<h2>Information Collection &amp; Use</h2>
</header>
<div class="content">
<h3>General</h3>
<p>We collect personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on
our website. Any personal, private information you provide to us will be used in connection
to contact you about the products or services in which you have expressed an interest or
which may be related. We do not share any information about you or your company to
unaffiliated third parties, except as necessary to administer the communications we offer
and as permitted by law. We may use a third party service provider to for communications;
that company is prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for
any other purpose. If you follow us on Twitter, Facebook or on other social media services,
we may use information provided by these services to customize our communications to you.
We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide with other third
parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Forums</h3>
<p>In order to use our forums, you must first complete the registration form and create a user
name and password. During registration you are required to provide contact information
(such as name and email address). We may use this information to contact you about the
products or services on our site in which you have expressed interest or which may be
related. You may have the option to provide additional demographic information (such as
title, company size, income level, gender etc.) to us; we encourage you to submit this
information so we can provide you a more personalized experience on our site and in our
marketing communications.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Orders</h3>
<p>If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable
information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name,
email, and address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date).
We use this information for billing purposes and to fulfil your order. If we have trouble
processing an order, we will use this information to contact you. We may also use this
information to contact you about the products or services on our site which you have
purchased or which may be related including information related to renewing your support
subscription.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Surveys or Contests</h3>
<p>From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on
our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information
from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you
therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested
information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and
demographic information (such as zip code). We use this information to better understand our
customers and to tailor any information that we may send you relating to our product or
services. By participating in a contest, you give us permission to publicize your name and
company affiliation solely in connection with the contest.</p>
</div>
</section>
<hr>

<header>
<h2>Communications from the Site</h2>
</header>
<div class="content">
<h3>Special Offers and Updates</h3>
<p>We will occasionally send you information on our products, services, special deals, or
promotions. Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these
types of communications. Please see the “Choice and Opt-out” section.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Newsletters</h3>
<p>If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address to
send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to
unsubscribe. Please see the “Choice and Opt-out” section.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Service-related Announcements</h3>
<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary
to do so. For instance, if our forums are temporarily suspended for maintenance, we may send
you an email notification.</p>
<p>Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.
Please see “Choice and Opt-out.”</p>
<hr>
<h3>Customer Service</h3>
<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we may send you a welcoming
email to verify your username and password. We will also communicate with you in response
to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. We will
communicate with you by email or telephone, in accordance with your wishes.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Profile</h3>
<p>We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, clear gifs, and third party
tracking services such as Google Analytics to create a “profile” of your preferences.
We may tie your personally identifiable information and your purchasing history, to
information in the profile, in order to provide tailored promotions and marketing offers
and to improve the content of the site for you. We do not share your profile with other
third parties.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Supplementation of Information</h3>
<p>In order to provide certain services to you, we may on occasion supplement the personal
information you submitted to us with information from third party sources.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section>

<h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
</header>
<div class="content">
<h3>Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</h3>
<p>We may share aggregated demographic and survey information about our user base with our
partners. This information does not identify individual users. We do not link aggregate
user data with personally identifiable information.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Agents</h3>
<p>We use a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. These companies
do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Legal Disclaimer</h3>
<p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law
and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with
a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our website.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Choice/Opt-out</h3>
<p>We provide you the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having your personally identifiable information
used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, if you purchase
a product/service but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you
can indicate your preference on our order form. If you no longer wish to receive our
newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following
the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us at
newsletter@ext.net.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Log Files</h3>
<p>As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log
files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet
service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and
clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to
analyze trends, to identify defects, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around
the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. IP addresses
may be tied to personally identifiable information to identify your location or similar
characteristics. We use a third-party tracking service that may use cookies, log files,
or other technologies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to
our site in the aggregate.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes.
We use cookies on this site. We may link the information we store in cookies to any
personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. We may use both session
ID cookies and persistent cookies. We may use session cookies to make it easier for you to
navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. A persistent
cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent
cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file. If you
reject cookies, you may still use our site. Some of our business partners (e.g., our analytics
provider) may use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies.
This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by us only and does not cover the use of
cookies by any such firm.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</h3>
<p>We may employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help
us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs
are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to
track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s
computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size
of the period at the end of this sentence. We may tie the information gathered by clear gifs
to our customers’ personally identifiable information. We use clear gifs in our HTML-based
emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge
the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see “Choice and Opt-out.”</p>
<hr>
<h3>Links to Other Sites</h3>
<p>This website contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Ext.NET, Inc.
Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.
We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of
each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy
statement applies only to information collected by this website.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Forums</h3>
<p>If you use our Forums, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you
submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be
used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable
information you choose to submit in these forums. Although the administrators and moderators
of Ext.NET Forums will attempt to keep all objectionable messages off, it is impossible for
us to review all messages. All messages express the views of the author, and neither the
owners of Ext.NET Forums, nor vBulletin Solutions, Inc. (developers of vBulletin) will be
held responsible for the content of any message. As a member of the Ext.NET Forums, you
warrant that you will not post any messages that are obscene, vulgar, sexually-oriented,
hateful, threatening, or otherwise violate any laws. We reserve the right to remove, edit,
move or close any content item for any reason.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted
industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during
transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method
of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially
acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute
security. If you have any questions about security on our website, you can send email us
at privacy@ext.net.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Business Transitions</h3>
<p>In the event Ext.NET, Inc., goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition
by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable
information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via prominent
notice on our website of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Changes in this Privacy Statement</h3>
<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement,
and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect,
how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to
modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material
changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our
home page.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Contact Us</h3>
<p>If you have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us at
