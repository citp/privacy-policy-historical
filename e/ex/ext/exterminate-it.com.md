# Exterminate It!: Privacy Policy

## General

This Privacy Policy applies to CurioLab’s Exterminate It! web site (further referred to as “Site”) and Exterminate It! software (further referred to as “Software”).

This policy may change from time to time so it is recommended that you check it regularly. All updates will be published on this site.

As a company that is committed to protecting your privacy, we understand your desire to safeguard your personal information. Whenever you provide us with your personal data, you give your consent to collect and use it in accordance with our privacy policy. We will not share any of your personal information with any third parties, unless required by law, without your permission.

## Exterminate It! Web Site

The Site does not use “cookies” to store your information during online sessions. When and if we add cookies in the future, we will modify this statement accordingly.

Information that is collected through the Site is the information that you explicitly provide using the Feedback and Support pages.

The Site includes a number of links to our business partners, with whom we have a variety of relationships. CurioLab is not responsible for the privacy practices of these business partners. We encourage you to read their privacy statements as they may differ from ours.

## Online Payment Processing

The ordering process is secure since the orders are processed by MyCommerce.com (former RegNow.com), an industry leader in providing e-commerce processing and online credit card processing services.

We do not store any credit card information; we collect only your personal information such as your name and email address. We use this information to supply the activation information to you.

Credit card processing is performed solely by MyCommerce.com – never by Exterminate It! itself.

## Exterminate It! Software

The Software does not send any private information to the Site.

Only the following information is sent to the Site:

  * Activation code generated during the activation process
  * A list of malware found during a virus scanning process (sent for statistical purposes)
  * A system snapshot during the uninstall process (sent for detection improving purposes)
  * A system snapshot when the “Submit State” feature was used  
Please note that a system snapshot includes NO private information.



## Emails and Notifications

We do not disclose your e-mail address to business partners or to anyone other than our employees. CurioLab may contact you by e-mail to respond to comments, feedback, and customer service inquiries you submitted.

CurioLab can send informational emails and notifications to your email address. We guarantee that these messages are 100% safe and contain only information related to our products. If you donтАЩt want to receive these emails you can disable them with a special option.

We send e-mails using the following domain names:
