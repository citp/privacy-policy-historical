### What personal information may be collected?

When you register with eXtension, we collect personally identifiable information, including your name and address. We may also ask for information about your areas of interest to provide relevant resources to better serve your needs. You may choose not to share your geographical information or areas of interest, but we encourage you to do so to receive a more personalized experience with eXtension.

Unregistered users of eXtension must provide their e-mail address and name when providing a comment or asking a question. “Ask the Expert” questions will also require a zip code in order to provide appropriate answers.

Information provided by unregistered users will be used only to follow-up on the particular question or comment from the user. Users have the option to register or opt-in to receive additional information or communications from eXtension.

For registered users, information collected during registration may be used to provide tailored information and resources for each user based on areas of interest and geographical location. Geographical information may be used to provide a customized home page featuring relevant local information and news.

Registered users have the option to allow eXtension to share your personally identifiable information with local Cooperative Extension offices to better serve your needs. You may also choose to receive local Extension newsletters and other communications. To ensure your privacy, you will be provided with a way to unsubscribe from any newsletters you may receive.

### Information sharing and disclosure

We do not share or sell your personally identifiable information to third parties.
