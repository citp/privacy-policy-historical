# Ziff Davis Media : Privacy Policy

#### Ziff Davis Media Privacy Policy

Ziff Davis Media is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy describes the ways that personally identifiable and anonymous information about our online users, event registrants and print subscribers is gathered, our information sharing practices, and how online users and print subscribers may request changes to the way this information is shared.

###### Personally Identifiable Information We Collect

We collect personally identifiable information when you provide it to us, such as when you subscribe to our magazines (either directly with us or through another company such as a subscription agency), sign up for email newsletters, enter a contest, register for site membership, participate in surveys, or to otherwise communicate with us. Several of the services that we offer, including but not limited to file downloads, message boards, eSeminars and the Web Buyer's Guide require registration as a condition of use; when you register with one of our sites you are no longer anonymous. We may also receive information about you from other sources and add it to the information you have provided to us.

###### Information You Volunteer and How it Is Displayed to Others Online

Ziff Davis Media is not responsible for the information you volunteer about yourself in the course of discussions in our forums, chat rooms, or other forms of publicly accessible interaction, or information that you choose to make public in your member profile. As a member, you can view, correct or change your publicly available information at any time via your member profile page. To view or change your profile, please follow the link for the site from which you registered:

  * [1UP.com](http://www.1up.com/)



Personally identifiable information you provide as a subscriber to the Microsoft Watch newsletter is not shared with anyone except on an aggregate, statistical basis, except for the purposes of fulfillment and email deployment.

###### What We Provide to Third Parties

###### Statistical Reports and Analysis

Naturally, the aggregate statistics that describe our print and online audience, which is often based on the information you provide when you subscribe, register, or browse our sites, help us sell advertising and otherwise publicize Ziff Davis Media and its brands. The information we share under these circumstances does not contain behavioral or identifying information about any individual reader or user, unless the individual has given us permission to share that information.

###### Mailing Lists

We make email and postal lists of our customers available on a rental, i.e., temporary, defined, basis, to carefully screened providers of quality goods and services. Many customers appreciate the offerings they receive, but here's what to do if you don't wish for us to share this information:

  * If you are a subscriber to a Ziff Davis Media magazine and would prefer that your contact information not be provided to third parties, please log in and change your preferences at [http://subhelp.ziffdavis.com](http://subhelp.ziffdavis.com/). (If you are a new subscriber, your information may not be immediately available – please allow up to 4 weeks from placing your subscription order for processing.)
  * If you are a registered user of our sites, you can change your preferences via the profile page links shown above.
  * If you are a registered user of Ziff Davis eSeminars, please send email with your preference request to[ eSeminars@ziffdavis.com](mailto:eSeminars@ziffdavis.com). Please see below for details on eSeminars's privacy policies. 
  * If you are a registered attendee of DigitalLife or other Ziff Davis Media Events, please send email with your preference request to [event_marketing@ziffdavis.com](mailto:event_marketing@ziffdavis.com). Please see below for details on Ziff Davis Media Event privacy policies. 
  * If you've registered to attend a Ziff Davis Media face-to-face event and prefer this information not be shared, please send email with your preference request to [events@ziffdavis.com](mailto:events@ziffdavis.com).
  * If you are a registered user of the Ziff Davis Web Buyer's Guide and prefer this information not be shared, please [click here](http://www.webbuyersguide.com/company/companymenu.asp) or send email with your preference request to [WebBuyersGuide@ziffdavis.com](mailto:WebBuyersGuide@ziffdavis.com).
  * If you are a registered member of a Connexus Media site (including PDFZone, Publish and GraphicsIQ), please send email to [privacy@internetbiz.net](mailto:privacy@internetbiz.net).
  * If you are a registered member of the DeviceForge sites (including LinuxDevices.com, DesktopLinux.com, WindowsforDevices.com and Deviceforge.com) and prefer your information not be shared, please send email with your preference request to [privacy@deviceforge.com](mailto:privacy@deviceforge.com)



Any mailing sent to our lists is carefully reviewed before it is sent, and when we rent our mailing lists, we monitor them to ensure they are used only for the approved purpose. Because of the difficulty inherent in tracking their use, we do not provide email address lists to third parties except for service purposes such as deployment or suppression, as described below.

Ziff Davis Media also provides profile reports on specific companies, based on subscriber-reported and publicly available data, to carefully screened providers of quality goods and services. These include contact information for the company and its key personnel.

###### Email and Postal Mail Deployment, Data Analysis and Other Data Services

We provide customer lists and other information to third party companies who provide specialized services, such as email message deployment, merge-purge (identifying and removing duplicate addresses) of lists, postal mailing, subscription fulfillment, customer service and telemarketing, research, statistical analysis, and other data processing. These companies work on our behalf and we do not provide our lists or other data to them for their own, permanent, use.

In order to comply with the Federal CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, we also may provide lists of customers who have opted-out of email promotion for Ziff Davis products to other companies, so they can be suppressed from mailings those companies send on Ziff Davis's behalf. In addition, if you unsubscribe from a mailing we send to our own list on behalf of a third party, your removal instruction may also be supplied to the third party and added to their own suppression file.

###### Ziff Davis Media Magazines, Seminars, Events, Sites and Other Publications and Services

As a Ziff Davis Media customer you can also expect to receive relevant email and postal offers for Ziff Davis Media publications, seminars, events, web sites and other services. From time to time we are also able to secure and offer to our customers specially-negotiated discounts and new products from other leading companies. If you would prefer not to receive such mailings in the future, you can change your preference via the links in the previous section ("Mailing Lists").

###### Change of Ownership of Ziff Davis Media Properties

The mailing list(s) associated with Ziff Davis Media properties may also be subject to transfer to another company in the event of a change of ownership. In this event, Ziff Davis Media or the new owner of the affected properties will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you and provide the opportunity to remove your name from the associated mailing list(s).

###### Anonymous Information We Collect

###### Cookies

As you probably know, cookies are small pieces of information that many Web sites store on your computer's hard drive when you visit them. They don't tell us who you are unless you've specifically given us personally identifiable information. Cookies stored on your hard drive by a Ziff Davis Media site are not accessible to other sites.

Like many other web sites, Ziff Davis Media sites use cookies to improve your experience with our online content. For example, we may use a cookie to identify members so they don't have to re-enter a user id and password when they wish to download a utility or post to a discussion. As another example, cookies can be used to control the number of times you see advertisements, like pop-ups. By allowing us to better understand how users interact with the site over time, cookies also help us improve your experience and deliver more relevant content to you. Cookies may be created directly by our sites for these purposes, or by third-party companies operating on our behalf. However, our cookies do not contain any information that is, in itself, personally identifying. Some of our advertisers occasionally serve you cookies as well. We do not have control over cookies placed by advertisers. You need not have cookies turned on to visit our sites, though cookies may be required in order for you to participate in certain areas. If you choose to become a member of a Ziff Davis Media web site, you must have cookies enabled to access any member related pages (i.e. Discussion Boards, Member Profile pages, Search for a Member).

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but allow you to modify security settings so you can approve or reject cookies on a case-by-case basis.

###### Pixel Tags

Like many web sites, Ziff Davis Media may also use pixel tags, also known as beacons, spotlight tags or web bugs, to improve our understanding of site traffic, visitor behavior, and response to promotional campaigns, as a supplement to our server logs and other methods of traffic and response measurement. Pixel tags are sometimes used in conjunction with small Javascript-based applications, also for the purpose of traffic measurement. We may also implement pixel tags provided by other companies, for the same purpose. You can disable pixel tags by changing your browser settings to omit images and disable Javascript; or there are commercial software packages available that can omit pixel tags and most advertisements.

###### Online Ad Serving

Ziff Davis Media uses Doubleclick, a third-party advertising service company, to serve advertisements when you visit our sites. This company may use information (not including your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, or any other information you've provided us) about your visits to our and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. For this purpose, Doubleclick uses cookies and may use pixel tags (also called clear gifs, spotlight tags and beacons) For more information about Doubleclick's information collection practices, and to know your choices about not having this information used by Doubleclick, [click here](http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/).

Several companies provide email deployment services for our email messages. The personally identifiable information, such as e-mail address, we provide to these vendors for the purposes of e-mail deployment is only used by them for that purpose and not for any other business activity. 

Some of our advertisers use third-party companies to serve their advertisements on our sites and, in some cases, in our HTML-formatted newsletters. Often, these third-party advertising companies employ cookie and pixel tag technologies to measure the effectiveness of Web and e-mail advertisements. We do not give any personally identifiable information to them as part of this relationship. Use of their tracking technology is subject to their own privacy policies. For more information about the privacy policies of the third-party advertising providers including information on how to opt out of their tracking methods, [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp).

###### Ziff Davis Media eSeminars

Ziff Davis Media eSeminars produces and hosts sponsored webcasts and online trade shows for a variety of companies (Sponsors). All data collected during the registration for such events will be shared with those Sponsors. This data is governed by the individual Sponsor's privacy policy and may be used by the Sponsor for follow-up purposes. Similarly, Ziff Davis Media eSeminars will have the same access to this data as the Sponsors, and this Privacy Policy continues to govern how Ziff Davis Media uses the data. For details on how eSeminar Sponsors use the information you provide, please contact the Sponsor directly.

Ziff Davis Media eSeminars also automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, Internet connection speed, Internet connection duration, and Real Media and Windows Media player information. This is done in conjunction with our broadcast provider, ON24, Inc. Your data is collected and retained by ON24 for the sole purposes of delivering eSeminars content appropriately, traffic reporting, and enabling re-registration for future events. In addition, ON24 uses cookie technology to identify you as a registered user of the eSeminars service.
