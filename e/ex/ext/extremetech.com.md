# Ziff Davis Media : Privacy Policy

#### Ziff Davis Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy")

This Privacy Policy describes the ways that Ziff Davis, Inc. (together with its parent and subsidiary entities, "Ziff Davis" "we" "us" or "our") gathers personal information, our information sharing practices, and how online users, event registrants and subscribers may request changes to the way their personal information is shared.

Note: (i) Since August 2007 Enterprise Media Group, Inc. has been doing business as Ziff Davis Enterprise; (ii) On January 5, 2009, the 1UP Network sites including 1UP.com, MyCheats.com, Gamevideos.com and Gametab.com were acquired by Hearst Interactive; and (iii) On April 1, 2009, Filefront.com was acquired by FileFront Ventures. These sites and entities are independent third parties and sites that are not related to us. For privacy and other information regarding these third party sites and entities, please go directly to the applicable site. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information collected or possessed by these third party sites or entities. 

_Personal Information We Collect_  
"Personal Information" means any information obtained through your use of our websites which might reasonably be used to specifically identify you and may include your name, title, company, address, email and phone number. We collect personal information when you provide it to us, such as when you subscribe to the PC Magazine Digital Edition (either directly with us or through another company such as a subscription agency), sign up for email newsletters, enter a contest, register for site membership or an online event, participate in surveys, attend face to face events, or otherwise communicate with us. Several of the services that we offer, including but not limited to file downloads, message boards, webcasts and online trade shows, require registration as a condition of use; when you register with, or sign into one of our sites, you are no longer anonymous. We may also receive information about you from other sources and add it to the information you have provided to us.

_Information You Volunteer and How It Is Displayed to Others Online_  
Ziff Davis is not responsible for the information you volunteer about yourself in the course of discussions in our forums, chat rooms, or other forms of publicly accessible interaction, or information that you choose to make public in your member profile. As a member, you can view, correct or change your publicly available information at any time via your profile page. 

**What We Provide to Third Parties:**

_Statistical Reports and Analysis_  
The aggregate statistics that describe our online audience, which are often based on the information you provide when you subscribe, register, or browse our sites, help us sell advertising and otherwise publicize Ziff Davis and our brands. 

_Mailing Lists_  
We make certain information such as email and postal lists of our customers available on a rental or other basis to third party providers of goods and services. 

_Email and Postal Mail Deployment, Data Analysis and Other Services_  
We provide customer lists and other information to third party companies who provide us with specialized services, such as email message deployment, merge-purge (identifying and removing duplicate addresses), postal mailing, subscription fulfillment, customer service and telemarketing, research, statistical analysis, hosting and other data and transaction processing. These companies work on our behalf and we do not provide our lists or other data to them for their own, permanent use. Please note that we may provide certain personal information (including credit card information, which we do not retain on our servers) directly to third parties solely for the purpose of processing sales of subscriptions or other services through our sites, and that such third parties' collection and use of that information shall be governed by such third party's own privacy policy, if any. In addition, we may enter into agreements with certain third parties to enhance the personal information they already possess about certain individuals, as a result of which we may provide that third party with other personal information about you in our possession. We also may provide to other companies lists of customers who have opted-out of email promotion for Ziff Davis or other products, so these customers can be suppressed from mailings those companies send on Ziff Davis's behalf. In addition, if you unsubscribe from a mailing we send to our own list on behalf of a third party, your removal instruction may also be supplied to the third party and added to their own suppression file. We are not responsible for the use of your information by any third parties. 

**Change of Ownership of Ziff Davis**

Some or all personal information maintained by Ziff Davis may be subject to transfer to another company in the event of a change of ownership of Ziff Davis or sale of any part of Ziff Davis.

**Information Collected**

_Cookies_  
As you may know, cookies are small pieces of information that many web sites store on your computer's hard drive when you visit them. They do not tell us who you are unless you have specifically given us personal information. 

Like many other web sites, Ziff Davis sites use cookies to improve your experience with our online content. For example, we may use a cookie to identify members so they do not have to re-enter a user ID and password when they wish to download a utility or post to a discussion. As another example, cookies can be used to control the number of times you see advertisements, like pop-ups. By allowing us to better understand how users interact with the site over time, cookies can also help us improve your experience and deliver more relevant content to you. Cookies may be created directly by our sites for these purposes, or by third-party companies operating on our behalf. For information about cookies set by Omniture SiteCatalyst [**click here**](http://www.omniture.com/en/privacy/2o7#optout), and for information about cookies from Google Analytics [**click here**](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html)

Some of our advertisers and content providers occasionally serve you cookies as well. We do not have control over cookies placed by advertisers and content providers. You need not have cookies turned on to visit all of our sites, though cookies may be required in order for you to participate in certain areas. If you choose to become a member of a Ziff Davis web site, you must have cookies enabled to access any member related pages (i.e., Discussion Boards, Member Profile pages, Search for a Member). 

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but allow you to modify security settings so you can approve or reject cookies on a case-by-case basis.

Note: You may stop or restrict cookies on your computer or purge them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences and you should consult the operating instructions that apply to your browser for instructions should you wish to do so and in general to determine how best to configure your browser settings to meet your requirements. However, if you 'turn off,' purge or disable cookies, although you may still use our Website, you may not be able to use all of the features, functions or services available on our Website. 

_Pixel Tags_  
Like many web sites, Ziff Davis may use pixel tags, also known as clear gifs, beacons, spotlight tags or web bugs, to improve our understanding of site traffic, visitor behavior, and response to promotional campaigns. Pixel tags are also used as a supplement to our server logs and other methods of traffic and response measurement. Pixel tags are sometimes used in conjunction with small Javascript-based applications, and for the purpose of traffic measurement. We may also implement pixel tags provided by other companies for the same purpose. You can disable pixel tags by changing your browser settings to omit images and disable Javascript; or there are commercial software packages available that can omit pixel tags and most advertisements.

_Online Ad Serving_  
Ziff Davis uses Doubleclick� and other third-party advertising service companies to serve advertisements when you visit our sites. These companies may collect and use information (not including your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, or any other personal information you have provided us) about your visits to our and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. For this purpose, these companies may monitor our sites using cookies and pixel tags for the purpose of reporting web site traffic, statistics, advertisement data and/or other activities on our sites. Such activities are subject to the privacy policies, of these companies, as applicable. The information collected through the use of these pixel tags is not personally identifiable. For more information about Doubleclick's information collection practices, and to know your choices about not having this information used by DoubleClick [**click here**](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html). 

_Email_  
Several companies provide email deployment services for our email messages. The information (such as e-mail addresses) that we provide to these vendors for the purposes of e-mail deployment is used by them only for that purpose and not for any other business activity. These vendors may also create their own cookies on your computer, for the purpose of tracking your interaction with the email messages you receive.

_Advertisements_  
Some of our advertisers use third-party companies to serve their advertisements on our sites and, in some cases, in our HTML-formatted newsletters. Often, these third-party advertising companies employ cookie and pixel tag technologies to measure the effectiveness of Web and e-mail advertisements. They may also employ cookie and pixel tag technologies to create a record of interaction with our site content that they use in conjunction with their advertising which appears on other sites. Use of their tracking technology is subject to their own privacy policies, if any. For more information about the privacy policies of the third-party advertising providers including information on how to opt out of their tracking methods, [**click here**](http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp).

_PCMagCasts, Online Expos, Learning Centers, and Sponsored Downloads_  
We operate PCMagCasts which produce and host sponsored webcasts and online trade shows for a variety of companies ("Sponsors"). All data collected during the registration process and the actual event will be shared with those Sponsors. This data is governed by the individual Sponsor's privacy policy (except as noted in the following sentence) and may be used by the Sponsor for follow-up purposes. Ziff Davis will have the same access to this data as the Sponsors, and this Privacy Policy continues to govern how Ziff Davis uses the data. For details on how PCMagCast Sponsors use the information you provide, please contact the Sponsor directly.

PCMagCasts also automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, Internet connection speed, Internet connection duration, and media player information. This is done in conjunction with our broadcast providers. Your data is collected and retained by the broadcast providers for the purposes of delivering PCMagCast content appropriately, traffic reporting, and enabling re-registration for future events. In addition, the providers use cookie technology to identify you as a registered user of the PCMagCast service.

If you have any questions about PCMagCasts, please contact pcmagcast@ziffdavis.com.

_Contests and Sweepstakes_  
Ziff Davis publications and web sites periodically conduct contests and sweepstakes. If you choose to enter, the data you provide will be subject to the official rules of the specific contest, as well as this Privacy Policy. Data collected during the registration for such contests and sweepstakes may be shared with sponsors. Please read the contest rules carefully before you submit your data.

_Co-Branded Sites and Services_  
When you use a co-branded service (a service operated with a service or site partner of Ziff Davis) within our network of sites, or register or otherwise provide information on a co-branded site, you grant us permission to pass the information collected back to that service or site partner. Use of your information by such partners is subject to their privacy policies.

_White Papers and Other Sponsored Downloads_  
Ziff Davis hosts product listings and offers informational downloads for a variety of third party companies ("Vendors"). When registration is required in order to receive or view the download, all data collected during product registration and/or Ziff Davis web site registration will be shared with the Vendor. When shared, this data is governed by the individual Vendor's privacy policy (except as noted in the following sentence) and may be used by the Vendor for follow-up purposes. Similarly, Ziff Davis will have the same access to this data as the Vendors, and this Privacy Policy continues to govern how Ziff Davis uses the data. For details on how Vendors use the information you provide, please contact the Vendor directly.
