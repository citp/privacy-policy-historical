              individual user (such as, for example, your full name, street address, 
              telephone number, credit card number or e-mail address) to any third 
              party without having received your permission. We may request personal 
              identification information from you in connection with your use 
              of, or participation in, our contests, sweepstakes, games, surveys, 
              forums, subscription registrations, content submissions, chats,

              voluntarily submit such information to us.<br>
              <br>
              If you do provide us with personal information, we may use it to 
              conduct the activities described above. If you identify yourself 
              to us by sending us an e-mail with questions or comments, we may 
              use your personal information to respond to your questions or comments. 
              We may file your comments for future reference, or we may discard 
              the information after we have reviewed it.<br>
              <br>
              We may also contact you to confirm your registration and about your

              to which different policies apply), and regarding changes to the 
              Extreme Team Productions Sites' Terms and Conditions and this Privacy 
              Policy. <br>
              <br>
              If you give us your permission, we may also use personal identification 
              information for internal or external marketing and promotional purposes. 
              On occasion, for example, we may send you e-mails to introduce a 
              product or service that we think might be of interest to the users 
              of our sites. For us to obtain your permission to send you this 
              information, we will give you an opportunity to "opt-in" at the 
              time our request for your personal information is made. If you do 
              "opt-in," you may choose to "opt-out" at any time, even after you 
              have provided personal information, by following the procedures 
              set forth below at the end of this Privacy Policy. Please note, 
              however, that under certain circumstances, if you initially do not 
              choose to "opt-in," or if you later "opt-out," you may not be eligible 
              for certain benefits for which a name, e-mail address, telephone 
              number or other personal identification information is needed.<br>
              <br>
              We have the following exceptions to these policies: We will release 
              specific information about you or your account to comply with any 
              valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute 
              or court order. We will also release specific information in special 
              cases, such as if there is an attempted breach of the security of 
              the Extreme Team Productions Sites, or a physical threat to you 
              or others.<br>
              <br>
              Please note that if you give out personal information online -- 
              for example, through a message board or chat room -- that information 
              can be collected and used by third parties. Although we strive to 
              protect our users' privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of 
              information you post in these forums. You disclose such information

              Our system also automatically gathers information about the areas

              We use such information in the aggregate to understand how our users 
              as a group use the services and resources provided on our sites. 
              This way we know which areas of our sites are favorites of our users,

              We may share this aggregate statistical information with our partners,

              names, personal navigational or other personal information. Some

              contain technology to collect information about our users for the 
              advertisers, but we will not permit such advertisers to collect
