This is statistical data about our users’ browsing actions and patterns, and does not show personal details that identify you.

7.2 For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file that is stored on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies are small pieces of information (e.g., cookies, web beacons, pixels, gifs tags or other similar technologies) sent by a web server to a web browser that allow the web server to recognize the web browser. This operates as a piece of data stored on your browser or device, or may identify, compile, aggregate and/or collect information through other means. They help us to improve our Website and to deliver a better and more personalized service. They enable us:

7.2.3 To speed up your searches.

7.2.4 To recognize you when you return to our Website.

You can choose to refuse all cookies, or to be prompted before a cookie is saved to your hard drive, or to only accept cookies from certain selected websites that you designate. Information on deleting or controlling cookies is available at www.AboutCookies.org. By refusing to accept cookies from us, you may not be able to use some of the features and functionality available on our Website.

**8\. ADVERTISING AND ONLINE TRACKING**

8.1 We may allow third-party companies to serve ads and collect certain information when you visit the Website. These companies may use certain information (e.g. click stream information, web browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to the Website in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third-party clear gif/web beacon to collect this information. Our systems do not recognize browser “Do Not Track” signals, but several of our service providers who utilize these cookies or web beacons on our Website enable you to opt out of targeted advertising practices. To learn more about these advertising practices or to opt out of this type of advertising, you can visit www.networkadvertising.org or www.aboutads.info/choices.

You may also have the right to object to or restrict certain types of processing of your personal information and can request to receive a machine-readable copy of the personal information you have provided to Extreme.

9.2 Extreme will assess any request to exercise one of these rights on a case by case basis. There may be circumstances in which we are not legally required to comply with your request because of relevant legal exemptions provided for in data protection legislation.
