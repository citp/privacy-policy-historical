We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf, (i.e. when fulfilling orders), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. Our contractors have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.

We may share non-personal aggregate statistics (group) data about visitors to this site, sales and traffic patterns. However we do not sell or share any information about you as an individual user of this site.
