# Extended StayAmerica Hotels - Extended Stay and Corporate Housing

Extended Stay Hotels and its four hotel brands, Extended StayAmerica Efficiency Studios, Homestead Studio Suites Hotels, StudioPLUS Deluxe Studios, and Crossland Economy Studios have created this privacy statement because we are committed to protecting our guests' privacy. The following discloses our security, information gathering and dissemination practices for the ExtendedStayHotels.com Web site. 

###### Information Collection and Use

Extended Stay Hotels is the sole owner of the information collected on this Web site. Extended Stay Hotels will not sell, share, or otherwise distribute your personal data to third parties. Extended Stay Hotels collects information from our users at several different points on our Website. 

We use WebTrends NetIQ, a service provider, to help us gather and analyze information about our customers. WebTrends' only role is to help us conduct our business and deliver the most relevant products and services. If you would like to deactivate our ability to analyze your anonymous browsing and purchase behavior through the use of this service or find out more about our service provider, including its privacy policy and how to opt out, [Click Here](http://www.netiq.com/about_netIQ/privacypolicy.asp). 

###### Log Files

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the Website, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

###### Links

This Website may contain hyperlinks to Websites operated by parties other than Extended Stay Hotels. Such hyperlinks are provided for your reference only. Extended Stay Hotels does not control such Websites and is not responsible for their contents. The inclusion of hyperlinks to such Websites does not imply any endorsement of the material on such Websites or any association with their operators. Those Websites may have different privacy policies. If you click onto another Website, you may want to check the privacy policy of that Web site. Extended Stay Hotels is not responsible for the privacy policies of other sites. 

###### Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our Website. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the cookie feature; however, you should note that cookies are necessary to provide you with certain features such as making a reservation. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our Website. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our Website. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Website. Some of our business partners use cookies on our Website (for example, online advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies. 

###### Online Advertising

We use a third-party company to serve online advertisements on our behalf across the Internet. During this process, we may collect information about your visits to our Website. This is primarily accomplished through the use of a technology commonly referred to as a Web Beacon or Action Tag, which we place on various pages of our Website and allows the third party to collect anonymous information. The information tracked is completely anonymous; it contains no personal information about any individuals. The anonymous information collected is used only to track our advertising's effectiveness and improve our advertising. If you would like more information about this practice, or if you prefer not to have this information used, [Click Here](http://www.atlasdmt.com/privacy/). 

###### Surveys & Contests

From time-to-time our Website requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this Website. 

###### Special Offers

We send all new Suite Offers members a welcoming email to confirm membership. Established members will receive information on services and special deals. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our choice and opt-out below. 

###### Correction/Updating Personal Information:

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. This can usually be done at the My Account page or by emailing us using the Contact Us page. 

###### Choice/Opt-out

Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our Website at the point where we ask for the information. For example, our reservation process has an 'opt-out' mechanism so users who book a room from us, but don't want any marketing material, can keep their email address off of our lists. All our emails promoting special deals to our Suite Offers members contain a link to Opt-out of receiving future emails. You may also use the Contact Us page to Opt-Out of receiving emails in the future. 

###### Site Security

By making your travel purchase on our secure server, you are protected by Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, utilized by most popular browsers, including Netscape and Microsoft Explorer. This technology allows us to use the most advanced encryption tools necessary to protect information transmitted between your computer and our server. Through encryption, the personal information you enter, including your name, address, and credit-card information, is converted into code that is then securely dispatched over the Internet. Once your secure server receives your encrypted personal information, it is translated back into its original form and stored in our off-line database. Your credit card information is not transmitted over the Internet again. 

###### Site and Service Updates

We also send the user Website and service announcement updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone. 

###### Notification of Changes

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
