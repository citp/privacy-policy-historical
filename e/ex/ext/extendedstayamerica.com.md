We are committed to protecting our guests’ privacy at Extended Stay America ®, Extended Stay Canada ®, and Crossland Economy Studios®.

**Information Collection and Use**   
We collect information from our users at several different points on our website. We will not sell, share, or otherwise distribute your personally identifiable data to third parties. When we need to collect personally identifiable information from you to provide you with a particular service, we will ask you to voluntarily supply us with the information that we need. For example, if you would like to make a reservation at one of our hotels, we will ask you for information needed to process your reservation. We will use your email address to send a confirmation and, if necessary, may use other information to contact you for help in processing your reservation.

We use a third-party service provider to help us gather and analyze information about our customers. Our service provider’s only role is to help us conduct our business and deliver relevant products and services. If you would like to deactivate our ability to analyze your anonymous browsing and purchase behavior through the use of this service or find out more about our service provider, including its privacy policy and how to opt out, [Click Here](mailto:marketing@extendedstay.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy%20Inquiry).

Personally identifiable information, as used in this Online Privacy Protection statement, means your name in association with one or more of the following items of data: street address, phone number, social security number, driver’s license number of other state-issued identification number, or your financial account information, including credit or debit card numbers.

**Correction/Updating Personal Information**   
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as user’s zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. This can usually be done at the My Account page or by emailing us using the [Contact Us](http://www.extendedstayamerica.com/contact/default.html) page. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone.

**Choice/Opt-out**   
It is our intention to only send you email communications that will be useful to you and that you want to receive. Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our website at the point where we ask for the information. You may click the option in any email we send to you or use the [Contact Us](http://www.extendedstayamerica.com/contact/default.html) page to opt-out of receiving emails in the future.

**Site Security**   
Your personally identifiable information is subject to security procedures and policies regarding protection and use of confidential information. For example, we use Secure Socket Layer on pages of our website where you enter personally identifiable information.

Extended Stay America is only responsible for the privacy statement and content of this website. We are not responsible for the data collection and use practices and privacy policy of or the use of cookies on third-party websites that you may access from our website.

**Legal Issues**  
This is a United States website and is subject to the laws of the United States and the State of South Carolina. We will disclose personally identifiable information without your permission when required by law, or in good faith belief that such action is necessary to protect our guests, visitors, associates, property, or others.

**Notification of Changes**   
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post a link to those changes on our homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under which circumstances, if any, we disclose it. Changes in treatment of personally identifiable information will affect information collected after the change is posted online.
