# Extron Electronics Privacy Policy | Extron

Extron Electronics cares about your right to privacy. This policy explains how we intend to handle any personal identification information you give us online. It does not apply to personal identification information that we collect offline. Personal identification information enables us to identify you, your e-mail address, name, business, etc.

#### How We Collect and Use Personal Identification Information

The Extron website is available for use by anyone, regardless of their willingness to disclose personal identification information. Sharing your personal identification information makes it easier for you to:

  * Request information or materials concerning our products and services.
  * Receive personalized newsletters and other messages on our products and services that we feel may be relevant to your interests. Your personal identity information generally facilitates future communication with you. For example, your Extron website registration information and customer profile will be used to generate personalized web content and send you Extron E-News, a monthly e-mail newsletter (if you select that option), and to occasionally send you informative e-mails about Extron products and services.
  * Purchase Extron products online (Extron dealers only).
  * Download software that supports Extron products.
  * View specialized content such as pricing, product availability, and special events (available to Extron dealers only).
  * Participate in surveys or submit a contest entry.



When you register with Extron, purchase products, or participate in a contest, we may ask you to offer personal identification information so we may serve your needs.

We also collect certain anonymous information that cannot be associated with you personally, such as the domains from which you visit us, the number of visitors to our website, browsing patterns, and areas of interest. We analyze this data to assess trends, statistics, and customers' needs, and to help us improve our website, products, and services to our customers. See Cookies.

#### Opting In, Opting Out

You may opt in or out of receiving information at any time. When you register with Extron, you have the option of selecting or deselecting the information you wish to receive (or not receive) from us. You may also change your mind and subscribe or unsubscribe at any time. For example, e-mail messages will contain instructions on how to unsubscribe so that you will not receive the e-mail in question in the future.

If you have a dealer login, you can go to Preferences to change your subscriptions.
