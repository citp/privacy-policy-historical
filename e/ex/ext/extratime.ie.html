<h2>ExtraTime -  PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
<br>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>We at ExtraTime.ie respect your right to privacy and comply with our obligations under the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2002. The purpose of this Website Privacy Policy is to outline how we deal with any personal data you provide to us while visiting this website. Naturally, if you are not happy with this Website Privacy Policy you should not use this website.</p>

<p>By visiting this website, you are accepting the terms of this Website Privacy Policy. Any external links to other websites are clearly identifiable as such, and we are not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of these other websites.</p>

<h2>2. Types of Information Collected</h2>


<p>We retain two types of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>"Personal Data"</p>
<p>This is data that identifies you or can be used to identify or contact you and may include your FirstName, LastName, Email Address and your preferences. Such information is only collected from you if you voluntarily submit it to us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Non-Personal Data"</p>
<p>Like most websites, we gather statistical and other analytical information collected on an aggregate basis of all visitors to our website. This Non-Personal Data comprises information that cannot be used to identify or contact you, such as demographic information regarding, for example, user IP addresses where they have been clipped or anonymised, browser types and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of our website.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Purposes for which we hold your Information</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Non-Personal Data:</p>
<p>We use the Non-Personal Data gathered from visitors to our website in an aggregate form to get a better understanding of where our visitors come from and to help us better design and organise our website.</p> 
</li>
<li>
<p>Personal Data</p>
<p>We will process any Personal Data you provide to us for the following purposes: 
(a) to provide you with the goods or services you have ordered;

<h2>4. Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</h2>

<p>We may provide Non-Personal Data to third parties, where such information is combined with similar information of other users of our website. For example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of unique users who visit our website, the demographic breakdown of our community users of our website, or the activities that visitors to our website engage in while on our website. </p>

<p>We will not disclose your Personal Data to third parties unless you have consented to this disclosure or unless the third party is required to fulfil your order (in such circumstances, the third party is bound by similar data protection requirements).

You will be notified in the event of any such transfer and you will be afforded an opportunity to opt-out.</p>

<h2>6. Security</h2>
