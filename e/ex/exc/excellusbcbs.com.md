**Frequently Asked Questions about Our Privacy Policy**   
Here are some questions and answers to help you understand our privacy policy: 

  1. **What is 'Personally Identifiable Information'?** It is any information that could be used to identify you. For example, your name, address or identification number. 

We collect two types of Personally Identifiable Information about our customers: 

> A. **Nonpublic Personal Information** \- This is information you give us on your enrollment form, claim forms, premium payments and other ways. It includes for example: names, account numbers, e-mail address, type of health care benefits and payment amounts. 
> 
> B. **Protected Health Information** \- This is information that you or your health care provider sends to us to process your claim. This includes diagnoses and type of services you receive from your health care provider. 

  2. **How Does Excellus Inc. use your Personally Identifiable Information?**   
We use this information to administer health care benefits and for our health care operations. For example: 
    * decide claim payment by asking you and/or your health care provider(s) for necessary information about services, or treatment; 
    * work with other insurers to decide coverage;
    * bill for premiums which may include looking at your claim history; 
    * answer customer and provider questions about benefits, enrollment and claims; 
    * monitor quality of care and service to our customers which may include case management, and 
    * perform utilization and cost containment review activities. 
  3. **Who Has Access To My Personally Identifiable Information?**   
Authorized employees at Excellus BlueCross BlueShield may access your information to administer benefits. Each year, all of our employees must sign an agreement to follow our Code of Business Conduct that includes our confidentiality policy. 

We may work with other companies to help us conduct our business. We are required by law to sign an agreement with these other companies that prohibits them from using or giving out information for any reason other than the purpose of the contract. For example we may contract with: 

    * benefits management companies for paying claims; 
    * health care provider groups to assess quality and cost containment; 
    * print or mail services for customer communications and surveys; 
    * audit or consulting firms for validating the integrity of our processes; 
    * state and federal agencies as required by law; and 
    * other Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans. 
  4. **How is my Personally Identifiable Information protected?**   
It is our policy to keep all information about you confidential. It is so important to us that we take the following steps: 
    * our employees sign an agreement to follow our Code of Business Conduct; 
    * we have a privacy oversight committee that reviews our privacy practices; 
    * we have a security coordinator to detect and prevent security breaches; 
    * all computer systems that contain personal information have security protections; and 
    * we check provider offices to ensure that medical records are kept in secure locations.
