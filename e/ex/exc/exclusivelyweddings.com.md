PRIVACY & SECURITY

Important Note: Descriptive, typographic, photographic or computer-generated errors are unintended and subject to correction. We cannot be liable for incorrect photos, typographical errors or discontinued merchandise.

  
Our Web site uses an online order form to make it easy for our customers to order our products or to request a copy of our print catalog. We will ask you for the following three addresses:

Contact Address: This is your permanent mailing address. We need this information in case we cannot get in touch with you by phone or email and need to ask you important information regarding your order.

Shipping Address: This is where you want your order shipped. Ideally, this is an address where someone will be available to receive your package. If you want us to ship to your office, be sure to give us the name of the company and suite or floor number to make sure that the delivery company can find you.

Billing Address: This is the address where your credit card bill is sent. In order to make sure that an unauthorized person is not using your credit card, we subscribe to Address Verification through our credit card processor. They will verify that the Billing Address you give us matches the address where your credit card bill is sent. If we don't get a match, we will contact you for further information. We have provided a convenient box to check if these addresses are the same as your Contact Address.

Telephone Number and E-mail Address: This information is needed in case we have a question regarding your order.

Wedding Date: This will ensure that we get your order to you before your wedding date.

  
Using a third party tracking service, we may track the Internet domain address and other, non-personally identifiable information about your visit to our site. This information is collected to identify trends and statistics that will help us to serve you better. Individual users will remain anonymous, unless you voluntarily tell us who you are.

  
Information sharing can provide a valuable type of consumer networking. By helping to make new connections and introduce new resources to our customers, you may discover new opportunities and products compatible with your interests and needs. With that end in mind, some customer information is shared with other select companies whose products and services you may find useful.

  
We appreciate and respect that not all customers may wish to benefit from the opportunity to share information with other select companies. If you do not want Exclusively Weddings to share your customer information, please immediately contact us and we will remove your name from lists we share with other companies. After the six to eight week time period it takes to process your request, your information will no longer be shared. When contacting us, please clearly state your request, including your name, mailing address, email address, and phone number.

  
We respect your privacy and have taken all necessary steps to ensure that your privacy is protected as you order from our Web site. We have a firm commitment to ensuring that others do not intercept the private information that you provide to us. We have instituted the most advanced security measures available on the Internet to protect your privacy.

This site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information that is given to us by our customers. We have an SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) connection to the area where we ask you for such necessary information as name, address, credit card number, etc. SSL is fully supported by Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator.

The easiest way to know that this is working is by noticing that instead of the normal "http" that precedes our Web address, you will see "https" in the area where you give personal information to us. If at any time you don't see the address starting with https while on the checkout pages, please send an email to [service@exclusivelyweddings.com](mailto:service@exclusivelyweddings.com) to alert us of this immediately.
