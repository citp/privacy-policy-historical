**Acceptance of Privacy Policy.**  By using the Site, you signify your assent to our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not use our Site. Your continued use of the Site following posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.

**Policies for Underage Individuals.**  We are committed to protecting the online privacy of children. We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children, nor is any part of our Site directed to children.

**Use of Cookies and Other Technologies.**  We may employ cookie technology to store and sometimes track information about the users of the Site. Cookies are a feature of web browser software that allows web servers to recognize the computer used to access a web site. Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by a user's web browser on the user's hard drive. Cookies can remember what information a user accesses on one web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that web site by the same user or to use the information to streamline the user's transactions on related web pages. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change your browser to prevent the browser from accepting cookies. If you reject cookies, you may still use the Site, but your ability to use some areas and features/functions of the Site may be limited.

We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on the Site. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate the Site. In addition, login areas on the Site require that your browser accept session ID cookies in order to verify that you are properly signed in. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following the directions provided in your Internet browser's "HELP" file.

We may use web beacons (small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of web sites) and auditing software to track page views and entry and exit points to and from the Site. In addition, we may use web beacons, cookies, customized links and/or similar technologies to determine whether electronic newsletter(s) sent by us to those who have requested them from us have been opened and which links are clicked. Any data collected will only be used in an aggregate form and will not contain any Personal Information, as that term is defined below.

This website is using Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics also uses "cookies". The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports through website activity, and to provide other services related to website activity and internet usage to the website operator.

Using first-party and third-party cookies together is standard in the marketing automation industry. Pardot cookies does not store personally identifying information, only a unique identifier. The visitor cookie is composed of a unique visitor ID and the unique identifier for the Excelitas Pardot account. For example, the cookie name “visitor_id12345” stores the visitor value “1010101010”, and “12345” is the account identifier. This cookie is set for visitors by the Pardot tracking code. If the Pardot account tracks opt-in preferences, the pi_opt_in cookie is set with a true or false value when you opt-in or -out of tracking.

At any time, you may ask us what personal data we have on file relating to you and the purposes for which we are using this data. You do not need to tell us why you are requesting this information. You may also request from us to not maintain such data anymore or to stop using it for a specific purpose.

If the data we have is not correct, you may ask for correction of our file. Such requests must be submitted to us at [privacy@excelitas.com](mailto:privacy@excelitas.com) or via post-mail to the company responsible for the Site without incurring costs other than the basic cost of transmitting this message. We will follow your request within a month after receipt. In order, however, to guarantee the security of any personal information provided to us we will take due measures to verify your identity before providing you access. You have the right to data portability, meaning the transfer of your data to another entity in a standard, machine-readable format. This will only be done to the extent technically feasible.

**Links.**  The Site contains links to third-party web sites. These links are provided solely as a convenience to you. If you access those links, you will leave the Site.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
