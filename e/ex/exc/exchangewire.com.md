##### **Visitors to our websites**

When someone visits www.exchangewire.com, we collect standard internet log information and details of visitor behaviour patterns. We do this to find out things such as the number of visitors to the various parts of the site. We collect this information in a way which does not identify anyone. We do not make any attempt to find out the identities of those visiting our website (www.exchangewire.com). We will not associate any data gathered from this site with any personally identifying information from any source. If we do want to collect personally identifiable information through our website, we will be up front about this. We will make it clear when we collect personal information and will explain what we intend to do with it.

#####  **Cookies**

Exchangewire utilises ‘cookies’. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user. ExchangeWire uses cookies to keep track of how often you visit our site, and to deliver content specific to your interests.

#####  **Use of cookies by ExchangeWire**

Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit. They are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site.

In addition to those above some of our ‘share’ functions, such as Facebook Like or Tweet, set cookies for their own purposes. These can vary and are not set explicitly by Exchangewire.com – these too can be blocked by configuring your browser settings.

ExchangeWire collects certain information about your device hardware and software, including, but not limited to:

– IP address  
– Browser type  
– Operating system  
– Access times  
– Referring website addresses  
– Location (down to city level)  
– Device

This information is used for the operation of the service, to maintain service quality, and to provide general statistics regarding use of ExchangeWire. If you choose not to have your browser accept cookies, you will still be able to view all of the ExchangeWire site. Google Analytics collects information about how visitors use our site. We use the information to compile reports and to help us improve the site. The cookies collect information in an anonymous form, including the number of visitors to the site, where visitors have come to the site from, and the pages they visited.
