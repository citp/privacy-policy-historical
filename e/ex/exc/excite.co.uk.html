<p>The information provided in this Privacy Policy covers your interactions on the Excite UK Network of sites. </p><p>As a standard practice, the Excite UK Network assigns a random number to each user for anonymously tracking content preferences and traffic patterns. <br>This random number lets us keep track of "how many" times customers are doing specific things - like visiting our site each month - without really knowing who those customers are. This random number is kept in a file on your computer called a "cookie." Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to determine the identity of any user: Unless you specifically tell us, the Excite UK Network will never know who you are.
</p></a><p><a name="privacy">You may, however, elect to tell us things that you want the Excite UK Network to remember. We hope that, like many of our customers, you will want to provide information about yourself to the Excite UK Network because it will make our Web sites more valuable to you. If you are comfortable providing us with information about yourself, enhanced services are available to you that are impossible for us to offer to anonymous users. An example of this is our </a><a href="http://mail.excite.co.uk/">Excite Mail</a> free email service. In this instance, we also
retain information about you between computing sessions by using the cookie.
</p><p>The choice of how much personally identifiable information about yourself to disclose to the Excite UK Network is left completely up to you, our customer. But however you choose to interact with the Excite UK Network, you have our guarantee of privacy:</p><p><b>The Excite UK Network will never willfully disclose individually identifiable information about its customers to any party outside the Excite UK Network without first receiving that customer's permission.</b> </p></font><p><font size="-1"></font>

</p><ol>
<li>Occasionally we ask you to provide us personal information such as your name, email address, or what your interests and hobbies are. You never have to answer these questions although this may limit what services we can offer you. For instance, we will not be able to offer you personalised stock portfolios if you don't tell us what stocks you wish to track. </li><li>We catalog traffic patterns throughout the sites. </li><li>We use a feature of your browser called a "cookie" to assign a "User ID." Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to find out the identity of any user. Your Excite UK Network User ID automatically identifies your computer - but not you - to our servers when you visit our site. <b>Unless you specifically tell us, the Excite UK Network will never know who you are, even though we assign your computer a cookie.</b> </li><li>Other companies that place advertising on our site also have the ability to assign a different cookie to you in a process that the Excite UK Network does not control.

Some of these personalised services are made available directly by the Excite UK Network (your "</a><a href="http://www.excite.co.uk">My Excite Start Page</a>" is a good example of such a personalised service). In other instances it is our partners who provide these tailored services from outside the Excite UK Network (such as <a href="http://www.excite.co.uk/motoring/">Motoring Classifieds</a> by Autotrader). </li><li>We analyze what our customers like and don't like about the Excite UK Network's current offerings so that we can design better services.<br>
</li><li>We use information about what you are searching for to help focus the advertisements we present to you, hopefully to make them more valuable to you. </li><li>We develop summary - not individual - reports for our advertisers. An example of a summary report might be "12,000 people clicked on Advertisement "X" today and of those people, 35% had previously indicated they had an interest in sports." The people that make it possible for you to use the Excite UK Network for free - our advertisers - need this information to determine how effective their advertising investments are. We never tell our advertisers who it was that saw or clicked on their advertisements unless you have specifically told us this is acceptable. </li><li>And occasionally we will send you email communications to provide information which we think you will find useful, including information about new products and services from the Excite UK Network. <b>It is our policy only to send email to customers who give us permission to do so</b>. In every such email, we will also have instructions on how to unsubscribe so that you will not receive any future emails from the Excite UK Network if you do not wish to, or you can avoid receiving them altogether - see the "<a href="#inout">Opt-in/Opt-out</a> Features " below. <p>

This right does not allow us to contact you to suggest you try a new service if you have asked us not to do so and issuance of a service alert is extremely rare. <br>On occasion, the Excite UK Network's partners who provide tailored services that require personal information in order to work (see "</a><a href="#use">Use of the Information</a>") will ask users to provide this personal information. the Excite UK Network cannot control the "Opt-in" or "Opt-out" policies of these companies; therefore, the Excite UK Network cannot control whether you become enrolled in our partner's services. </font>
