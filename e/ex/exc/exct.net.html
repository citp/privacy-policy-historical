        <h4>Safe Harbor Data Privacy Notice</h4>

        <p>ExactTarget, Inc. ("ExactTarget") adheres to the Safe Harbor Principles published by the
        U.S. Department of Commerce (the "Safe Harbor Principles") with respect to personal
        information (as defined below) it receives from the European Union.</p>

        <p>This notice outlines our general policy and practices for implementing the Safe Harbor
        Principles, including the type of information to which this notice applies, how we use
        personal information, and the choices individuals have regarding our use of, and their
        ability to correct, that personal information. If there is any conflict between the
        policies in this notice and the Safe Harbor Principles, the Safe Harbor Principles will
        govern.</p>

        <p>This notice applies to all personal information we handle, including on-line (except as
        noted below), off-line, and manually processed data. For purposes of this notice, "personal
        information" means data that:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>is transferred from the European Union to the United States;</li>

          <li>is recorded in any form; and</li>

          <li>is about, or pertains to, a specific individual who is identified in, or is
          identifiable from, the data.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>"Sensitive information" is a subcategory of personal information. Sensitive information
        is defined as personal information specifying medical or health conditions, racial or
        ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union
        membership, or the sex life of the individual. Sensitive information also includes personal
        information received from a third party where the third party treats and identifies it as
        sensitive.</p>

        <h4>Safe Harbor Principles Regarding Personal Information</h4>

        <p><strong>Notice and Choice</strong></p>

        <p>We notify individuals about the personal information we collect from them, how we use
        it, and how to contact us with privacy concerns. We obtain personal information only as
        permitted by the Safe Harbor Principles or with the consent of the individual affected.
        Consent for personal information to be collected, used, and/or disclosed in certain ways
        may be required in order for an individual to obtain or use our services. To the extent
        permitted under the Safe Harbor, we reserve the right to process personal information in
        the course of providing professional services to our clients without the knowledge of
        individuals involved.</p>

        <p><strong>Disclosures and Transfers</strong></p>

        <p>We do not disclose personal information to third parties, except when one or more of the
        following conditions is true:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>We have the individual's permission to make the disclosure;</li>

          <li>The disclosure is permitted by law or mandatory professional standards;</li>

          <li>The disclosure is reasonably related to the sale or other disposition of all or part
          of our business or assets;</li>

          <li>The personal information to be disclosed is publicly available;</li>

          <li>The party to whom the disclosure is made controls, is controlled by, or is under
          common control with ExactTarget;</li>

          <li>The disclosure is reasonably necessary for the establishment or maintenance of legal
          claims; or</li>

          <li>The disclosure is to persons or entities for whom we are providing services, provided
          the disclosure is consistent with the purpose for which the personal information was
          obtained.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We will comply with the Safe Harbor Principles with respect to disclosures of sensitive
        information, including, when applicable, obtaining the explicit consent of the individual
        prior to disclosing sensitive information to a third party or using sensitive information
        for purposes other than those for which it was originally collected or subsequently
        authorized by the individual. Transfers of information permitted under this notice, either
        to third parties or within ExactTarget, include the transfer of data from one jurisdiction
        to another, such as transfers to and from the United States of America.</p>

        <p><strong>Data Security, Integrity, and Access</strong></p>

        <p>We employ physical, electronic, and managerial measures, including education and
        training of our personnel, designed to provide the personal information in our possession
        with reasonable protection from accidental loss or destruction, improper use, alteration,
        or disclosure. Personal information collected or displayed through a Web site is protected
        in transit by industry standard encryption processes. However, we cannot guarantee the
        security of personal information accessible on or transmitted via the Internet.</p>

        <p>We process personal information in ways compatible with the purpose for which the
        personal information was collected, or as otherwise authorized by the individual. To the
        extent necessary for such purposes, we take reasonable steps to make sure that personal
        information is accurate, complete, current, and otherwise reliable with regard to its
        intended use.</p>

        <p>If an individual becomes aware that personal information we maintain about that
        individual is inaccurate, or if an individual would like to update or review his or her
        personal information, the individual may contact us using the contact information below. As
        a security precaution, we may request that the individual provide identifying information
        such as name, address, birth date, and/or social security number. In addition, we may limit
        or deny access to personal information where providing such access would be unreasonably
        burdensome or expensive in the circumstances, or as otherwise permitted by the Safe Harbor
        Agreement. In some circumstances, we may charge a reasonable fee, where warranted, for
        access to personal information.</p>

        <p><strong>Accountability and Enforcement</strong></p>

        <p>We established a program to monitor our adherence to the Safe Harbor Principles and to
        address questions and concerns regarding our adherence. This program will include a
        statement, at least once a year, signed by our authorized representative, verifying our
        adherence to the Safe Harbor Principles. We encourage interested persons to raise any
        concerns with us using the contact information below.</p>

        <p>With respect to any dispute relating to this notice that cannot be resolved through our
        internal processes, we will cooperate with competent European Union data protection
        authorities and comply with the advice of such authorities. In the event that we or such
        authorities determine that we did not comply with this notice, we will take appropriate
        steps to address any adverse effects and to promote future compliance.</p>

        <p><strong>Amendment</strong></p>

        <p>We may amend this notice from time to time by posting a revised notice on this Web site,
        or a similar Web site that replaces this Web site. If we amend the notice, the new notice
        will apply to personal information previously collected only insofar as the rights of the
        individual affected are not reduced. So long as we profess to adhere to the Safe Harbor
        Principles, we will not amend this notice in a manner inconsistent with the Safe Harbor
        Principles.</p>

        <p><strong>Information Subject to Other Policies</strong></p>

        <p>We are committed to following the Safe Harbor Principles for all personal information,
        as that term is defined herein. Other information we receive may be subject to policies
        that may differ in some respects from the policies set forth in this notice. Certain of our
        Web sites have their own privacy policies that apply specifically to those Web sites. Those
        policies may be accessed through the Web sites in question. Information relating to present
        or former ExactTarget personnel is subject to our policies concerning personnel data
        privacy, which are available to present and former ExactTarget personnel upon request.
        Information obtained from or relating to clients or former clients is further subject to
        the terms of any privacy commitment made to the client, any agreements with the client,
        and/or any applicable laws and professional standards.</p>
