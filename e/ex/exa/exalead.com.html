LINKS TO WEBSITES NOT CONTROLLED BY DS OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES</strong><br><br>This Site might offer links to third party Websites which may be of interest to You. <br><br>Unless DS receives Your express authorization, DS does not share any Personal Data with these third parties.

Consequently, DS declines all liability for the content of third party websites or the practices of these third parties concerning the protection of Personal Data. <br><br>It is therefore Your responsibility to inform yourself as to these third parties' privacy policies. <br><br><strong><br>7. TRANSFER OF PERSONAL DATA </strong><br><br>If You are accessing the Site from a location outside of the European Union, with laws or regulations governing data collection, use, and disclosure that differ from European Union, please note that through Your continued use of the Site, which are governed by French law, the corresponding Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, You are transferring Your Personal Data to the European Union and You consent to that transfer. <br><br>As a global company, DS is able to use available technology to efficiently manage Personal Data and obtain such Personal Data online or otherwise throughout its international operations.&nbsp; Personal Data may be collected through the Site and subsequently disclosed to and used by an affiliate or subsidiary of DS for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy. <br><br>Please note that DS may transfer Your Personal Data outside the European Union, as long as before transferring Your Personal Data, DS has ascertained that non European Union entities have certified compliance with the European Union Directive on Data Protection and/or U.S. Safe Harbor Principles or that appropriate contractual measures have been taken to secure the transfer. <br><br>Where DS has knowledge that a third party to which DS has provided Personal Data for the purposes listed in Article 4 above, is using or disclosing Personal Data contrary to this Privacy Policy or to applicable law, DS will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop such use or disclosure. <br><br>You will have the opportunity to decide whether You authorize DS to use Your Personal Data for a purpose differing from the purpose for which it was originally collected.<br><br>DS will also disclose Personal Data to third parties if DS determines that such disclosure is necessary for technical reasons (such as hosting services by a third party) or to protect DS’s legal interests (such as in the event of acquisition or merger by a third company or total or partial liquidation of DS).). These transfers may be transmitted over the internet, via mail, via facsimile, or by any other method which DS determines is appropriate and in accordance with applicable law. <br><br><br><strong>8. RIGHT OF ACCESS TO AND RECTIFICATION OF THE DATA </strong><br><br>DS will take reasonable steps to ensure that the Personal Data collected is used for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy and that such Personal Data is correct and up to date.<br><br>You have a right to access Your Personal Data, as well as a right to request the rectification, completion, update or erasure of Your Personal Data. You also have a right to obtain a copy of the Personal Data conserved by DS. <br><br>If You have an account, You can exercise Your rights of access to and rectification of the Personal Data by logging on to Your account.

</p>
<p class="bodytext"><br><strong>9. DATA SECURITY AND RECIPIENTS</strong><br><br>DS undertakes to ensure the protection and security of Personal Data that You choose to communicate, in order to ensure the confidentiality of Your Personal Data and prevent Your Personal Data from being distorted, damaged, destroyed or disclosed to unauthorized parties. <br><br>DS maintains reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect Personal Data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alternation and destruction.&nbsp; As part of those safeguards, DS employs sophisticated technology designed to protect Personal Data during its transmission and prevent transmission errors or unauthorized acts of third parties.&nbsp; However, while DS strives to protect Your Personal Data, in light of the inevitable risks of data transmission over the internet, DS can not guarantee full protection against any error occurring during the course of Personal Data transmission which is beyond DS' reasonable control. <br><br>Since all Personal Data is confidential, access is limited to employees, contractors and agents of DS who have a need to know such data in carrying out their tasks. All the people who have access to Your Personal Data are bound by a duty of confidentiality and subject to disciplinary actions and/or other sanctions if they fail to meet these obligations. <br><br>However, it is important for You to exercise caution to prevent unauthorized access to Your Personal Data. You are responsible for the confidentiality of Your password and information appearing on Your account. Consequently, You must ensure that You log out of Your session in the event of shared use of a computer. <br><strong><br>10. DISPUTE RESOLUTION </strong><br><br>Although DS has put in place reasonable safeguards to protect Personal Data, we recognize that there is no method of transmitting or storing Personal Data that is completely secure. <br><br>However, DS is committed to ensure the privacy of Personal Data: if You have a reason to believe that the security of Your Personal Data has been compromised or misused, You should contact DS via the following address: <a href="javascript:linkTo_UnCryptMailto('ocknvq,FU0RtkxceaRqnkeaB5fu0eqo');">DS.PrivacyPolicy(at)3ds.com</a>.<br><br>DS will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints regarding use and disclosure of Personal Data in accordance with the principles contained in this Privacy Policy. .<br><br>Unauthorized access to Personal Data or the improper use of Personal Data may constitute offences under local law and under the regulations in force within each company in the DS group. <br><br><strong>11. CONTACT </strong><br><br>For any additional question concerning this Privacy Policy, You may send an email to the following address: <a href="javascript:linkTo_UnCryptMailto('ocknvq,FU0RtkxceaRqnkeaB5fu0eqo');">DS.PrivacyPolicy(at)3ds.com</a>. <br><br><br><strong>12. DATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE OF THE PRIVACY POLICY AND CHANGES TO IT </strong><br><br>This Privacy Policy may be updated according to DS' requirements and circumstances, or where required by law. <br>&nbsp;<br>Last modification: This Privacy Policy was modified on June 2010.<br><br></p>
