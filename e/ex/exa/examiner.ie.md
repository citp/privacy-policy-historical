To target relevant news content or ads to you based on your previous visits to the site, this makes your experience with our content more relevant and allows us to supply our content free of charge. We do not and will not personally identify you for this information, we use aggregated anonymous data so for example we can tell an advertiser we have 5000 male users based in Cork and allow them to target an ad to those users but they will never know the individual details of those 5000 male users

**Site Security**

At IrishExaminer.com we make every effort to protect the data which you provide to us. We consistently monitor our servers for unauthorised access and we have appropriate security management systems in place to safeguard this. Anti-virus software and Firewalls are installed on all areas of the site. If we ask anyone else to do some work for us on our websites or servers we ensure they have the same high levels of security in place.

We do recognise however that, unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide to us. You do so at your own risk.

Third party activities relating to any advertiser to whom you submitted your information via IrishExaminer.com are beyond our control. We urge you to review the privacy policy of such advertisers to ensure your information is secure once it is transferred to that third party. If you wish to modify any information submitted to an advertiser you must contact them directly as they are responsible for that information.

**IP Addresses and Cookies**

Like most other websites we will collect information about your computer including, if available, your IP Address, Operating System, Browser Type and Location for statistical and behavioural tracking. This information helps us to enhance our service to you. This does not identify any individual; it is used as a tool to gather broad levels of data for analysis and to measure audience size and patterns of usage such as visitor numbers and how unique they are.

We may also collect a cookie file for the same reason. These are small files that a site or service provider transfers to your hard drive through your browser which essentially enables us to remember certain non-identifiable information. You can disable cookies through Internet Options on your browser menu at any time.

We also use outside providers for web-site statistics. The primary provider we use is Google Analytics. You can find further information on the information which it collects at http://www.google.com/analytics/.

If you access us via a mobile browser or our App we may identify the location of your device, the browser type you accessed with and the operating system.

**How long will we store the information for?**

We will only store your information as long as you are active on the website and engaging with our content. If you have not engaged with the website for 2 years we will send you an email to determine if you wish to remain registered with us.

**How can I update information?**

You can log into your account at any time to edit your details, change your newsletter subscriptions or delete your profile.

**Affiliates or 3rd party organisations**

We may partner with co-branded organisations or other companies to supply services for our users. If you opt to sign up to those companies or purchase from them you should familiarise yourself with their privacy policy and terms and conditions. They may pass information regarding what you have purchased back to us for tracking purposes or so that your account is up to date when you log in.

Some of these companies may include credit-card and billing processing, ad serving, shipping, email distribution, list processing and analytics or promotions management. We provide these companies only with the information they need to perform their services. These service providers are restricted from using personal information in any way other than to provide services for Landmark Digital, and they may not share, resell or use the data for their own direct marketing purposes.

We reserve the right to disclose your opt-out information to third parties so they can suppress your name from future contact lists, in accordance with relevant laws. We may occasionally release personal information as required by law, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena.
