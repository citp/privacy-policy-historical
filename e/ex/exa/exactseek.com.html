    <h2>Privacy Policy Overview</h2>
    
    <p>This Privacy Policy covers the ExactSeek treatment of personal information that is recorded when you 
    submit your site for inclusion in our database or when you purchase one or more of the three site listing and
    promotion packages offered on our site.</p>
    
    <p>Our privacy policy does not apply to the practices of other companies advertised, or otherwise listed, 
    on the ExactSeek web site, nor does it extend to people that ExactSeek does not employ or manage.</p>

    <h2>Registration</h2>
    
    <p>Members may be asked to provide certain personal information when they sign up for our Services including 
    name, address, telephone number. The personal information collected from Members during the registration 
    process is used to manage each Member's account (e.g. billing purposes). ExactSeek does not rent or 
    sell email addresses nor any other personal data, unless specifically stated otherwise or in special circumstances.</p>
    
    <p>However, in instances where ExactSeek and a partner jointly promote a Service, ExactSeek may 
    provide the partner certain personal information, such as the name, email address, and URL of persons who 
    subscribed to the Service in order to allow the partner to succesfully deliver the promoted Service. 
    In such an instance, the partner may not not use personal information for any other purpose.</p>
    
    <p>ExactSeek.com may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from 
    personal information Members provide during registration (such as the total number, but not the names, of Members). 
    As explained in more detail to the right, we may use this aggregated and non-identifying information to sell advertisements 
    that appear in our newsletters or on our network.</p>
    
    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    
    <p>A "cookie" is a small data file that can be placed on your hard drive when you visit certain Web sites. 
    ExactSeek.com may use cookies to collect, store, and sometimes track information for statistical purposes to 
    improve the products and services we provide and to manage our telecommunications networks. If you are a Member, 
    we will use a cookie to save your settings and to provide customizable and personalized services. These cookies 
    do not enable third parties to access any of your customer information.</p>

    
    <p>Advertisers and partners may also use their own cookies. We do not control the use of these cookies and 
    expressly disclaim responsibility for information collected through them.</p>
    <h2>Security</h2>
    
    <p>Your personal information is stored in a protected directory. Access is restricted to ExactSeek staff.</p>
    
    <p>ExactSeek does <b>not</b> store any credit card information. Purchases made on ExactSeek are processed either 
    by PayPal or 2Checkout.com.</p>
    
    <h2>Change of Ownership</h2>

    <p>In the event of a change in ownership, or a direct merger or acquisition of ExactSeek.com with another entity 
    or multiple entities, all (or select aspects) of ExactSeek.com's customer information (including email addresses) 
    may be transferred to a separate entity or entities. All ExactSeek.com subscribers and registered users will be 
    notified of any change in ownership, merger or acquisition of ExactSeek.com's assets by a third party by email 
    announcement or through prominently placed notices on the web site. Subscribers and users may choose to access 
    and modify any of their registration and subscription information at that time.</p>

    <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    
    <p>ExactSeek may amend this policy from time to time. If significant changes are made in the way your personal 
    information is used, we will post a prominent announcement on our site notifying you of the change.</p>

  <div class="right_int" style="padding-bottom:0;">
    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

    
    <p>ExactSeek offers four types of site listings - Standard, Featured, Paid Inclusion and Local Search. The information
    collected for each of these services, and how that information is used, is noted below:<br><br>
    
    • <b>Standard Listings:</b> Email address and URL. Used in our newsletters (opt-in only). Email addresses and URL 
    details are also provided to InternetSeer for their free web monitoring service. URL only provided to EntireWeb.com 
    for inclusion in their search engine index.<br><br>
    
    • <b>Featured Listings:</b> Email address, URL, Title, Description and Keyword term. Your email address is NOT shared. <br><br>

    • <b>Paid Inclusion Listings:</b> Email address and URL. Your email address is not shared, but your site URL is provided 
    to Entireweb.com for inclusion in their search engine index. <br><br>

    • <b>Local Search Listings:</b> Business Name, Address, City, State, Zip, Phone number, business email address, URL 
    and Category. All information is public. Your billing email address is kept private. <br><br>
    
    ExactSeek Standard listings are free and the information collected is not shared with third parties, 
    except as noted above. However, we may disclose personal information collected, if we have 
    received your permission beforehand or in very special circumstances, such as when we believe that the law requires 
    such disclosure or other special cases described below.</p>
    
    <p>Membership is required under a valid, verified email address in order for you to submit your 
    website to our free Standard Listing program. Upon the creation of a new member account, and in lieu of
     a site submission fee, you will be subscribed to one of our newsletter publications, SiteProNews or SEO-News, 
    and provided a free subscription to the InternetSeer Web site monitoring service.</p>
    
    <p>Your use of ExactSeek's services constitutes a business relationship wherein we provide a promotion service for 
    your website(s). In exchange, ExactSeek reserves the right to use the contact information collected during site 
    submission to deliver notices regarding changes or updates to our service, to provide free newsletters 
    (SiteProNews, SEO-News), to inform you of additions to the Jayde Online Network of web sites, or to send announcements 
    and carefully screened offers and information on behalf of our partners or advertisers.</p>
    
    <p>You may remove yourself from any or all of our newsletter, notice and announcement mailings at anytime 
    using the unsubscribe methods provided in those mailings. Any mailing received from our company is clearly identified 
    and includes a valid email address and unsubscribe link which you can use to remove yourself from future mailings. If 
    you encounter problems in this regard, contact <a href="mailto:abuse@exactseek.com"><b>abuse [at] exactseek.com</b></a>. Our 
    turnaround time for responding to unsubscribe requests is generally 1 business day.</p>

    
    <h2>Special Cases</h2>
    
    <p>It is ExactSeek.com's policy not to use or share personal information about Visitors or Members in ways 
    unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise 
    prohibit such unrelated uses. However, ExactSeek.com may disclose personal information about Visitors or 
    Members, or information regarding your use of the Services or Web sites accessible through our Services, 
    for any reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including: to satisfy 
    laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental or legal requests for 
    such information; to disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against 
    someone who may be violating our Acceptable Use Policy or other user policies; to operate the Services properly; 
    or to protect ExactSeek.com and our Members.</p>
