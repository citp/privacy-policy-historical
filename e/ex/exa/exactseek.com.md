# Privacy Statement: ExactSeek.com

  
**Privacy Policy Overview**   
This Privacy Policy covers the ExactSeek treatment of personal information that is recorded when you submit your site for inclusion in our database. 

Our privacy policy does not apply to the practices of other companies advertised, or otherwise listed, on the ExactSeek web site, nor does it extend to people that ExactSeek does not employ or manage.

  
**Information Collection and Use**   
ExactSeek offers two types of site listings - Standard and Enhanced. Unlike many directories and search engines that charge for site listings and collect personal information as well, ExactSeek listings are free and the information we collect is dependent on your needs.

For Standard Site submissions, the only information collected is Name, Email Address, URL and Site Type. Additional information is collected for Enhanced Site listings in lieu of a site submission fee.

Your use of ExactSeek's services (standard or enhanced listing of your web site or sites) constitutes a business relationship wherein we provide a promotion service for your web site(s). In exchange, ExactSeek reserves the right to use the contact information collected during site submission to deliver notices regarding changes or updates to our service, to provide free sample newsletters, to inform you of additions to the Jayde Online Network of web sites, or to send announcements and carefully screened offers and information from our partners. 

With the exception of auto-response messages which are sent at the time of site submission and which contain important confirmation details regarding your site listing,  you may remove yourself from any or all other notice and announcement mailings at anytime using the unsubscribe methods provided in those mailings. Any mailing received from our company is clearly identified and includes at least 2 methods to remove yourself from future mailings. Should you encounter problems in this regard, contact [**support@exactseek.com**](mailto:support@exactseek.com). Our turnaround time for responding to unsubscribe requests is generally 24 hours.

  
**Information Sharing and Disclosure**   
ExactSeek maintains your email address and other pertinent personal information, provided at the time of your site submission, on the premises. ExactSeek allows carefully screened vendors the opportunity to send you offers and information that we have deemed may be of value to you. You may opt-in out of this feature at any time. 

  
**Cookies**   
At this time, Cookies are not used on the ExactSeek site.

  
**Security**   
Your personal information is stored in a protected directory. Access is restricted to ExactSeek staff.

  
**Changes to this Privacy Policy**   
ExactSeek may amend this policy from time to time. If significant changes are made in the way your personal information is used, we will post a prominent announcement on our site notifying you of the change.
