Cookies can collect information about users of our site like you, such as your names, address, e-mail details, passwords and your user preferences. While cookies and the information they obtain may not identify a living individual on their own, they may be able to do so in combination with other information held by us or a third party. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website and also allows us to improve our site. The website uses session cookies for site navigation purposes. These cookies expire and are deleted at the end of a browsing session. We also use Google Analytics for tracking and data capture purposes. Data collected through cookies is always anonymous and aggregated.
