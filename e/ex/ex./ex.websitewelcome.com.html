              Your Internet browser has the in-built facility for storing small

              work properly, (ii)
              “performance cookies” allow us to analyze how you use our website
              so we can measure and improve the performance of our website,
              (iii) "functional cookies"

              Pixel tags and cookies may be used in those email messages to help
              us measure the

              We do not share personally identifiable information about
              individual customers with advertisers. We may share aggregated and
              non-identifying information
              about our customers that we collect through the registration
              process or through online surveys and promotions with certain
              advertisers. In some instances,
              we use this aggregated and non-identifying information to deliver
              tailored advertisements. For example, an advertiser may tell us
              the audience they want to
              reach are small businesses that have online stores and provide us
              with an advertisement tailored to that specific audience. Based
              upon the aggregated and
              non-identifying information we have collected, we may then display
              the advertisement to the intended audience.

              We may share customer information obtained from customer surveys
              within our corporate family, and with trusted third parties to

              <strong>Domain Registration</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              In certain jurisdictions or pursuant to the rules of the Internet
              Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN") or certain
              registries, the contact
              information you provide to register a domain name (“Domain Name
              Registration Information”) has to be made available and accessible
              to the public through a
              "WHOIS" search. The WHOIS database is a publicly accessible
              database that lists the Domain Name Registration Information for a
              particular domain name, the
              name server(s) to which the domain name points, and the domain
              name's creation and expiration date. The Domain Name Registration
              Information you provide is
              hosted by us or a third party service provider and is made
              available to the public through the WHOIS database. At times,
              customers may receive
              solicitations that result from searches of the publicly available
              WHOIS database by other companies or individuals. Any such
              solicitations or SPAM do not
              come from Cloud Hosted and we do not control the use of WHOIS
              information by third parties. Further, pursuant to ICANN rules,
              Cloud Hosted is required to make WHOIS
              data available to any third party that enters into a bulk access
              agreement. While ICANN allows individuals to opt-out (using the
              account management panel,
              domain management console or similar service) of having their
              WHOIS information made available to third parties through bulk
              access, companies, such as
              ours, and other organizations do not have the ability to opt-out
              of having their information made available to a third party that
              enters into a bulk access
              agreement. We may also deposit your Domain Name Registration
              Information with a third-party escrow provider to comply with
              ICANN requirements.

            <p>
              We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials to

              about users upon a valid
              request by government or law officials as we, in our sole
              discretion, believe is necessary or appropriate to respond to
              claims and legal process (including
              without limitation subpoenas) or as otherwise required to comply
              with applicable laws. We may also disclose information that is
              necessary to identify,
              contact, or bring legal action against a party that threatens us,
              our systems or our customers (for example, to prevent a
              Distributed Denial of Service or

              Cloud Hosted uses technical security measures to prevent the loss,
              misuse, altering or unauthorized disclosure of information under

              measures include but are not limited to: physical, electronic and

              collect online. All
              sensitive information is collected on a secure server. When we ask
              customers to provide financial information (such as credit card
              numbers) that data is
              protected using Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") technology. We follow
              generally accepted standards to protect the personal information
              submitted to us, both
              during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of
              transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage,
              is 100% secure.
              Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have
