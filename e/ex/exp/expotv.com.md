We restrict third parties who may place cookies on your browser from having access to any personally identifiable information you have given to us.

## How We Use Personal Information

We will use your personal information to contact you and provide you with information that you may request. 

We may also use your personal information for internal business purposes, such as analyzing and managing our business. We may also combine the information we have gathered about you with information from other sources. We may use third parties to help us operate our business and the Sites or administer activities on our behalf. We may share your information to allow third parties (including blogs, ecommerce, retailer, or manufacturers) to organize, identify, sort, attribute and publish our content on their public website, in their public marketing materials or for other public or private use by such third parties. We may share your information with these third parties for those limited purposes. 

EXPO may share aggregate statistical information with its partners, suppliers and other third parties. EXPO may also share personal information with a third party including but not limited to first name, last initial, city and state of residence, selected interests, or date of birth but will not include last name, or direct contact information such as email, street address or telephone number. A member may request that such direct contact information be shared, by opting-in to programs or newsletters that may require such information. Unless you tell us not to, we may also use your personal information to contact you about offers or promotions we think you would be interested in. If at any time you would like to stop receiving such information or opt-out of a feature, you can let us know by sending an e-mail stating your preference to [privacy@gen.video](mailto:privacy@gen.video?Subject=).

Please note that if you give out personal information online in public forums such as on an EXPO message board or on video or profile comments, that information can be collected and used by third parties. Although EXPO strives to protect its users' privacy, EXPO cannot guarantee the security of information you post in these forums. You disclose such information at your own risk. 

## Email Marketing

The Sites may contain links to other Web sites, such as retailer or product manufacturer Web sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites or for the privacy policies and practices of other third parties. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third party sites or services before providing any of them with your personal information. 

## Our Security Precautions

The Sites have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. We use industry standard technology to protect the security of your information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we are committed to protecting your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.
