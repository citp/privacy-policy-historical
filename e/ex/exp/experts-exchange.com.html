Experts Exchange uses your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and for other administrative purposes including, but not limited to, directing you to a geographically closer data center, providing you a registration page in your country's local currency. We also use IP addresses to gather broad demographic information from all visitors. You can browse portions of this website without giving us any additional information. EU and Swiss individuals whose personal data we are processing under the Privacy Shield have the right to access correct or delete their personal data by contacting us at <a href="mailto:customer_support@experts-exchange.com">customer_support@experts-exchange.com</a> or calling at +1 (877) 211-8911.</p>
                    
                    <p>Most of the services offered on Experts Exchange are only made available if we have certain information about you. To access these services, you will, from time to time, be asked to submit personal information about yourself. Experts Exchange' site registration form requires you to give us contact information (such as your name and email address), billing information (such as your credit card information) and demographic information (such as your zip code).

                    <ul>
                    <li>more detailed contact information (including a picture of yourself);</li>
                    <li>information regarding your personal or professional experience and interests; and</li>

                    <p>You have the right to change or remove the information in your profile at any time by editing your profile.</p>
                    
                    <p>If you make any postings to public areas, such as public forums or by providing content, then this information will be stored on our databases for public viewing, and in such case, any personally identifiable information you submit will be publicly available and can be read, collected and used by other users, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.</p>
                    
                    <p>By entering your details in the fields requested, you enable Experts Exchange and its service providers to provide you with the services you select. Whenever you provide such personal information, we will treat that information in accordance with this policy.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="title">2. Information on visitors – Use of Cookies</h2>
                    
                    <p>During the course of any visit to Experts Exchange, the pages you see are downloaded to your computer along with something called a "cookie". Cookies are text files that identify your computer to our server. Cookies in themselves do not identify the individual user, just the computer used. Cookies themselves record those areas of the site that have been visited by the computer in question, and for how long. Most websites use cookies because cookies allow the website publisher to ascertain whether the computer has visited the site before. In addition to browsing history, cookies may store the geographic location of a computer and the preferences associated with that computer on Experts Exchange.</p>
                    
                    <p>Any information that is supplied by cookies can help us to provide you with a better service and assists us to analyze the profile of our visitors. They make it easier for you to maintain your preferences on Experts Exchange, and by seeing how you use Experts Exchange; we can tailor our website around your preferences.</p>
                    
                    <p>Experts Exchange works with third parties to serve ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. This policy only covers the use of cookies by Experts Exchange and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. Experts Exchange does not have control, nor access to the information contained in its advertisers' cookies.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="title">3. Your ability to monitor and control cookies</h2>
                    
                    <p>Users have the opportunity to set their computers to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. The last of these, of course, means that certain personalized services cannot then be provided to that user. You can, should you choose, disable the cookies from your browser and delete all cookies currently stored on your computer. This may, however, prevent you from taking advantage of services that Experts Exchange has to offer.</p>
