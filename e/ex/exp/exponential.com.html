We are a member of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") and we maintain compliance with the  <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/principles.asp" class="privacytextlinks">NAI’s Self-Regulatory Principles</a>.</p>
      <p class="privacy">This Privacy Policy is intended to provide consumers with clear and complete information about the consumer data we collect in connection with our Services and the way that data is stored and used by our company, our Advertisers and our Publishers.

      <p class="privacy"><strong>Information We Collect <br>

        </strong>


      </p><p class="privacy"><u>Non-Personal Information Collected by our Services</u><br>

       We deliver advertisements from hundreds of Advertisers across a multitude of Publisher websites.  When you visit one of the Publisher websites in our network, our automated system may collect “click stream data” related to your visit to the website.  Click stream data is anonymous and can include information such as your IP address, Web pages viewed, the date and time at which those pages were viewed and interaction with content and advertisements on those Web pages.  Technologies used to collect this click stream data, include cookies and Web beacons.  For a description of cookies and Web beacons see our <a href="javascript:hpopWin('FAQ-privacypolicy.jsp','_blank',750,500)" class="privacytextlinks">FAQ section</a>. Our anonymous cookies are programmed to expire in six months.
 <br>
<br>
In order to improve performance, we augment our click stream data with non-personally-identifiable behavioral and demographic data from Publishers. This anonymous data may include such things as zip code, age, gender and income range.  
<br>
<br>
We utilize the non-personal information described above to better customize the sort of advertisements you see.  We also aggregate anonymous cookie data in order to identify large audience segments that assist advertisers in targeting their campaigns to the most relevant Internet audience.  </p>
 <p class="privacy"><strong>Consumer Choice - Opting Out of Receiving Cookies</strong><br>
We use technology which includes cookies and web beacons in the delivery of our Services.  We believe that the use of these tools enables us to provide users with a more meaningful web experience.  You may adjust your computer’s web browser settings to refuse all cookies.  However, please note that because cookies are widely used, disabling the use of cookies in your web browser may interfere with full use of various websites.<br>

      <p class="privacy">Through this opt-out procedure, your computer will request an “opt-out cookie” ID tag that will prevent your anonymous data from being matched to your computer and thereby prevent us from using that data to deliver targeted advertising or other content to your computer’s browser. Please note that this opt-out process will erase the cookie ID associated with your computer but <u>not</u> the cookie itself - the cookie itself <u>must</u> remain on your computer in order for us to recognize you as an opt-out user. This means that if you use multiple computers or multiple browsers you will need to opt out of receiving cookies on each computer and for each browser.  Also, if you change computers or delete cookies from your computer you will need to repeat this opt-out process.  </p>
      <p class="privacy"><u><a name="personal"></a>Personally Identifiable Information Collected By Our LeadGenuity Service</u><br>
LeadGenuity helps marketers reach potential customers who are interested in receiving information about their products or services. In response to a marketer’s advertisement, you may choose to provide personally identifiable information such as your name, address, telephone number and/or email address.  Exponential will not merge any of this data with any non-personally identifiable information collected by our systems and will not use this personally identifiable information in any way that is not authorized by the marketer for whom it is collected.  In addition, we keep this data in a separate database to preserve our guarantee that advertisements are delivered only through the utilization of anonymous consumer data.  <br>
<br>
<u>Personally Identifiable Information Collected Through Our Corporate Website</u><br>

You may also provide us with personally identifiable information (such as your name, email address, physical address or telephone number) when you elect to contact us about this Privacy Policy or any other customer-service related matter. We will only utilize such personal information for the purpose of responding to your inquiry.  However, we do reserve the right to retain an archival record of all such correspondence.<br>
<br>

We reserve the right to disclose personally identifiable information you have disclosed to us in response to judicial process or court order or to provide information to law enforcement agencies or in connection with an investigation of matters related to public safety, as permitted by law.  </p>
      <p class="privacy">
        <strong>International Transfers of Data<br>
        </strong>Personally identifiable information collected by Exponential on its own behalf or on behalf of its LeadGenuity clients may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Exponential or its affiliates, subsidiaries, agents or customers maintain facilities. You acknowledge and agree that personally identifiable information you provide to us may be transferred outside of the country in which you reside. Providing such information will constitute your consent to any such transfer.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Information Security<br>
                  </strong>Exponential follows generally accepted industry standards to protect against unauthorized access to, destruction or disclosure of data.  This includes undertaking necessary physical, electronic and management activities required to protect data integrity, access and use.  Any data that is stored on our servers is treated as confidential and is not made generally available to the public.  Our servers are protected by firewalls and are located in secure data facilities to further increase security. Please keep in mind, however, that despite these reasonable efforts to protect data on our servers no method of transmission over the Internet is guaranteed to be secure.  Therefore, while we strive to protect your personal data at all times, we cannot guarantee its absolute security and shall not be liable for any breach of security by an outside party.   <br>

                    <br>

                    <strong>Transfer of Data Upon Change of Control<br>
                    </strong>In the event that another company acquires all or substantially all of the assets of our business through a consolidation, merger, asset purchase or other transaction, we reserve the right to transfer all data (including any personally identifiable data) that is in our possession or under our control to such acquiring party.<br>
