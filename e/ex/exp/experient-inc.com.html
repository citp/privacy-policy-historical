("Experient") is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Maritz&nbsp;Holdings Inc., its subsidiaries and divisions (including Maritz Global Events), is committed to building user trust and confidence by promoting, and complying with, business practices that help protect the privacy of our customer and user data. This policy provides our commitment to your privacy by describing our information, practices and policies to ensure compliance with the Privacy Shield privacy framework, as defined by the U.S. Department of Commerce in cooperation with Switzerland and the European Commission.&nbsp; The policy applies to your usage of our online websites, mobile applications and our transfer of personally identifiable information.</p>
