Accounts without this activation can not be used and will be deleted automatically. 

**Intended Use** : Access to the free members area, authentication of the user, internal identification of the user as well as account management (e.g., creating a new password)

### Additional Information

#### Password security

Passwords are never stored in a readable clear form. They are only stored as a hash value. The used hash function is Bcyrpt which was especially developed for hashing and saving of passwords ([Wikipedia regarding Bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt)). 

#### SSL or TLS encryption

For security reasons, all websites can only be reached via an encrypted connection. You can recognize an encrypted connection by looking at the address bar of the browser. "http://" changes to "https://" and the lock icon in your browser bar. 

#### Revoke your consent to data processing

Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke an existing consent at any time. An informal message by e-mail to us is sufficient. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation. 

#### Right to data portability

You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you, which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and you have the right to transmit this data to another party. If you require the direct transfer of data to another person, this only happens if it is technically feasible. 

#### Right of appeal to the competent supervisory authority

In the case of violations of data protection law, the person concerned has a right of appeal to the responsible supervisory authority. Responsible supervisory authority in data protection questions is the state data protection officer of the federal state in which our company is based (Berlin). A list of data protection officers and their contact details can be found on the following link: <https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Anschriften_Links/anschriften_links-node.html>.
