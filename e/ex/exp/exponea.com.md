##  PERSONAL DATA SHARING

In line with the provisions of the General Terms and Conditions, we may also provide certain Services aimed at connecting our customers to services, such as e-mail or SMS, of other providers such as the providers of messaging platforms. By clicking the “I agree” button that completes the registration process and creates the Account for you or by submitting the respective Order Form to Exponea, you provide us with the express consent to share your personal data with these third-party providers for the purpose of fulfilling the Agreement (typically, you as our client provide us with all data required for such connection). We may also provide the data to third parties such as (i) hosting providers; and/or (ii) advertising partners. Any such partners will be available on our websites (typically in our Guides), and such parties will then act as processors of your data. Subject to the previous sentence, your personal data shall not be shared or provided to any other third party without your consent except for the following cases: (i) where Exponea is obliged to provide personal data by law or an order of public authority; or (ii) if personal data sharing is specifically allowed by applicable legal regulations.  
If third-party providers are established outside of the EU/EEA, you agree that we may transfer your data to these third parties. In such cases, Exponea shall ensure that it cooperates only with third-party providers that are located in countries that ensure adequate levels of protection based on the European Commission’s adequacy decision, or that Exponea has entered into agreements with corresponding Model Contractual Clauses that ensure adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of the privacy and fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals.  
We are committed to storing your data securely. Therefore, we have implemented adequate physical, technical and organisational measures and plans for protecting and securing data collected from you (which do not, however, deprive you of your duty to take proper steps to secure your data, particularly for the transmission of data to our Account). The aim is to eliminate unauthorised or unlawful processing of your personal data or the accidental, unauthorised or unlawful accessing, use, transferring, processing, copying, transmitting, alteration, loss or damage of your data. Despite all efforts to meet the rules set out in applicable legal regulations, it is not possible to ensure the security of your data if it is transferred or transmitted in an unsecured way. We will protect your data in the following ways:  
using cryptography, where necessary;  
using password or secured token protection, where necessary; and  
restricting access to your data (i.e. access to your personal data is granted only to those of our employees or contractors for whom the access is necessary).

You may edit your data using your Account, or contact us at privacy@exponea.com should you have any request about data held. However, where requests from you are manifestly unfounded, excessive or repetitive, we may either: (i) charge a reasonable fee, taking into account the administrative costs of taking the actions requested; or (ii) refuse to act on the request.
