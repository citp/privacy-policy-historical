## What Information does Experience Oz collect?

In an effort to keep our service as simple and easy as possible, we do not create, use or store profiles of our customers other than for the purposes of our newsletter (see details below). We only record PII and other information that we reasonably require to do business with you. On all Experience Oz pages that collect PII, we specifically describe what information is required in order to provide you with the product or service you request.

### We collect PII when you:

  * Make a booking or purchase: We collect your full name, email address and phone number each time you make a booking or purchase with Ticketmates. We will also collect credit card information, including card number, card type, security number, cardholder name and expiry date to pay for experiences purchased through Experience Oz.

  * Tick 'Remember my details for next time' on booking or purchase page: We retain your full name, email address, phone number, credit card type, and name on card when you tick 'Remember my details for next time' while making a booking or purchase.

  * Subscribe to our newsletter: Experience Oz collects email addresses, names, city of residence and communications preferences from people who elect to subscribe to the Experience Oz newsletter.

  * Surveys, promotions and competition information: Occasionally, we may offer site visitors or newsletter recipients an opportunity to participate in a survey, promotion or competition. The PII we collect when you participate in a survey, promotion or competition may include your full name, email address, telephone number and street address.

  * Submit a review: We collect your name or other identifier nominated by you and your comments when you submit a review to us. We may publish these details.

  * Contact Experience Oz: We collect PII such as your full name, email address and/or telephone number and feedback whenever you submit an enquiry or suggestion, provide feedback or comments or request assistance with a booking or purchase.




### Other info we collect:

  * Statistical information: When you visit our site, we record general information about your visit for statistical purposes. These statistics do not contain any PII.

  * Cookies: We may, from time to time, use "cookies" to store your preferences, record session information and collect information on how you visit and access our web pages and newsletters. We collect information on the web pages and newsletters visited by our customers to help us continue to improve our services. Cookies are pieces of information that our web page transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies can make the web more useful by storing information about your preferences on a particular site. The use of cookies is an industry standard and many websites use them to provide useful features for you. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify you, only your computer. You can delete cookies from your computer at any time (see your internet browser's help menu for more information); however, this will remove all cookies and not just those associated with the Ticketmates Australia site. You can individually remove a cookie that connects a property to your shortlist by clicking the remove option when the property appears in your shortlist.




## How does Experience Oz use my Information?

We use your PII only for the purpose of providing our services and communicating with you in relation to bookings or purchases and deals. Information collected on the Experience Oz site may be used to:

  * Purchase Experience Oz products or services: Information collected when you purchase from us is used to charge your credit card and deliver your booking or purchase confirmation electronically. We may contact you about your booking or purchase with related offers from us or our partners we think may be of interest to you. We may also contact you about your stay for customer service and feedback purposes, to make any changes or cancellations to your booking or purchase.

  * Display your details when you next book with us: We will only display your details if you have ticked 'Remember my details for next time' while making a booking or purchase with us. This is done to reduce the information you need to type when you next make a booking or purchase. Your full name, email address, phone number, credit card type, and name on card are the only details stored when you select this option. We will also add any property you attempt to book to your shortlist for easier future access.

  * Send newsletter email: We will only send newsletters to people that have opted in to receive them. Our newsletters provide information about deals, and will occasionally offer incentives for completing surveys or participating in competitions or promotions. We use the individual preferences provided to us by newsletter subscribers and their interactions within our newsletters to tailor the relevance of our newsletter content.

  * Reviews: We use the customer name or other identifier nominated by the customer and the customer's hotel review comments in accordance with our Review Guidelines.

  * Respond to your questions or suggestions: We will use your email address and/or telephone number to contact you when you submit a question or suggestion.




## Who does Experience Oz share my Information with?

We do not disclose any information about customer bookings or purchases to anyone except in the following circumstances:

  * Experience suppliers: We provide the guest name, telephone number and (in exceptional circumstances only) email address for each booking made to the relevant accommodation supplier. Our accommodation suppliers require this information for the booking and may use it if they need to contact you about the booking or purchase. Although we offer accommodation from reputable accommodation suppliers, we have not placed specific limitations on these suppliers from using or disclosing your information without your permission. Therefore, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of any suppliers whose accommodation you purchase on our website.

  * Service providers: We work with an online payment gateway provider and fraud detection provider to enable secure credit card transactions on Experience Oz. We provide credit card information (where applicable) relating to bookings or purchase to enable them to process and screen the payment on our behalf.

  * Legal obligations: We may be required by law to disclose information you provide us with for the purposes of obtaining products or services from Experience Oz. We may also disclose information against someone who poses a threat to our interests (such as customer fraud) or whose activities could cause harm to others.




## How do I Control and Access my Information?

We believe that site visitors and customers should have control over the collection and use of their PII. Here's how you can control and have access to your information:

  * Newsletter subscription and unsubscription: If at any time you would like to either change your email address with us, update your newsletter preferences or unsubscribe from our newsletter you can:

  * Click the "Unsubscribe" button at the bottom of any recently-delivered Experience Oz newsletter you have received; you will be automatically removed from our mailing list, OR;

  * Send an email to enquiry@experienceoz.com.au advising that you would like to unsubscribe, change your preferences or change your email address. Be sure to include details of your old and new email addresses for changes.

  * Booking and Purchase information: If at any time you would like to alter the PII you provided us in your booking or purchase, please contact us.

  * Remember my details for next time: If at any time you would like us to stop remembering your details for the next time you book, untick "Remember my details for next time" the next time you make a booking or purchase, or contact us.

## How does Experience Oz Protect my Information?

To ensure the confidentiality of your PII, we use only the leading security technology and procedures that are regularly reviewed and updated in accordance with new or revised legislation and technological advancements.

We have also obtained a digital certificate from Thawte Server CA (part of the VeriSign group), an industry leader in the protection and management of data transmission.

Our systems are configured with industry standard data encryption and firewall technology. When you send PII to us over the Internet, your data is protected by Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to ensure safe transmission.
