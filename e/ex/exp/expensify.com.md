We are committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and security of information about our users and their organizations. This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") describes how we collect, use, disclose, share and secure the personal and company information you provide when you use our expense management, invoicing or bill processing software, through our mobile application ("the Application") or visit the Expensify Website <https://www.expensify.com/> ("the Site" and, together with any related software, tools and services provided in connection with the Application or the Site, the "Expensify Service"). It also describes your choices regarding the use, access and correction of your Personal Data (as defined in section 3 of this Privacy Policy) and how to contact us if you have any further queries or complaints about our management of your personal information. 

In this Privacy Policy, "you" and "your" refers to individual users of the Expensify Service, as well as to Members and Corporate Members.

The US and other non-EEA countries do not have similar data protection laws to the European Union, and you should be aware in particular that the law and practice in the United States in respect of law enforcement authority access to data is significantly different from Europe. Where we transfer your information we will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected consistent with our obligations under local law and the Privacy Shield Framework. By submitting information via the Site, you agree to this storing, processing and/or transfer.

So that we can provide you with our products and services, we may need to collect Personal Data (as that term is defined below) about you or others. If you do not provide us with the Personal Data we request, we may not be able to supply you with some or all of our products and services. 

Expensify collects Personal Data from you when you visit our Site, when you send us information or communications in connection with your use of the Expensify Service, and/or when you download and use the Expensify Software. "Personal Data" means data that allows someone to identify or contact you or your employees, consultants, and independent contractors, including, for example, name, address, geographic location of your computer or mobile device, telephone number, credit card number, email address and bank account information. If you are accessing the Expensify Service from Australia, "Personal Data" also includes any information or opinion, whether true or not and whether recorded in material form or not, by which you may be reasonably identifiable. 

##  Personal Data You Provide To Us 

We collect Personal Data from you, such as first and last name, email and mailing addresses, telephone number, professional title, company name, and password, when you register for the Expensify Service. In addition, we (or our third-party credit card or payment processor on our behalf) will collect Personal Data including your credit card number or account information when you upgrade to a paid account. We also retain information on your behalf, such as the Personal Data described above and any correspondence. If you provide us feedback or contact us via email, we will collect your name and email address, IP address, as well as any other content included in the email, in order to send you a reply, and any information that you submit to us, such as a resume. If we conduct a survey in which you participate, we may collect additional profile information. We may also collect Personal Data at other instances in the Site or Application user experience where we state that Personal Data is being collected. 

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Expensify stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. If your friend is a resident of the European Union or Australia, please make sure they are happy to be contacted by us. 

When you provide us with Personal Data about your contacts we will only use this information for the specific reason for which it is provided.

Your friend may also contact us at [help@expensify.com](mailto:help@expensify.com) to request that we remove this information from our database. 

##  Personal Data Collected by Third Parties 

We will collect your Personal Data from you unless it is unreasonable or impracticable to do so. However, we may collect and receive Personal Data about you from companies that distribute the Expensify Service by way of a co-branded or private-labeled website, companies that offer their products and/or services via the Expensify Service, or companies that provide services (such as payment processing services) in connection with the Expensify Service (collectively, "Partner Companies"). Our Partner Companies may supply us with Personal Data, such as your name and email and mailing address information or your login credentials for such Partner Company's website or service, in order to help us establish the account or fulfil orders. We may also collect your Personal Data from public sources. We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via our Site or Application in order to perform and improve the Expensify Service. If you provide us Personal Data about others, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us. 

This Privacy Policy applies only to the use and disclosure of Personal Data that we collect while you use the Expensify Service. Our provision of a link to any other website or location is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such other website or location or its contents. When you click on such a link, you will leave the Expensify Service and go to another site. During this process, a third party may collect Personal Data from you. We have no control over, do not review, do not endorse, and cannot be responsible for, these outside websites or their content. Please be aware that the terms of this Privacy Policy do not apply to these outside websites or content, or to any collection of data after you click on a link to a third party. If you submit Personal Data to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website you visit. 

##  Personal Data Collected via Technology 

The Expensify Service (which may be hosted by a third-party service provider) collects Personal Data from you, such as browser type, your approximate geographic location of your mobile device or computer (from your Internet Protocol (IP) address), operating system and version, Internet Protocol (IP) address, domain name, information about your application, operating environment and hardware profiles and/or a date/time stamp for your visit. We may also use Identifiers (as defined below) and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and/or access to the Expensify Service and your activity on the Site and the Application. Like most internet services, we automatically gather this Personal Data and store it in log files each time you visit the Site, use the Application or access your account on our network. 

When you interact with the Site or the Application, we try to make that experience simple and useful. We and our partners use industry standard identifiers, such as cookies or other similar technologies. We also use mobile device identifiers which perform a similar role, like the IDFA used by Apple devices and the UDID used by Android devices. Cookies are small pieces of information which are issued to your computer or mobile device (as the case may be) when you visit a website or access or use a mobile application and which store and sometimes track information about your use of the Site or Application (as the case may be). A number of cookies we use last only for the duration of your web or Application session and expire when you close your browser or exit the Application. Other cookies are used to remember you when you return to the Site or Application and will last for longer. We refer to cookies and the mobile device equivalents as "Identifiers". 

We use Identifiers to: 

  * remember that you have visited us before; this means we can identify the number of unique visitors we receive; 
  * customize elements of the promotional layout and/or content of the pages of the Site or Application; 
  * collect statistical information about how you use the Site or App (including how long you spend on the Site or Application) and where you have come to the Site or Application from, so that we can improve the Site and learn which parts of the Site and which functions of the Application are most popular with users. 



Usage information may be linked to your account in order to assist Expensify to provide services to your account, for example analysing data for the purposes of trouble shooting. Expensify will not sell or disclose usage data to any third party unless such usage data has been aggregated or de-identified and is no longer capable of identifying you as an individual. 

Our Site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook "Like" button and Widgets, such as the "Share this" button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Site, and may set an Identifier to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it. 

Some of the Identifiers used by the Site are set or accessed (as appropriate) by us, and some by third parties who are delivering services on our behalf. 

Most web and mobile device browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent that or to notify you each time a cookie is set. You can also learn more about cookies by visiting [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/) which includes additional useful information on cookies and how to block cookies using different types of browser or mobile device. Please note, however, that by blocking or deleting cookies used on the Site or Application, you may not be able to take full advantage of the Expensify Service. 

In addition to cookies, web beacons may be set by us or third parties in respect of your use of the Site or Application. Web beacons are small image files within the content of the Site or Application for analytics purposes so we or third parties can understand which parts of the Site or Application are visited and which functions of the Site or Application are used and whether particular content is of interest. 

When you download and use the Expensify Service, we automatically collect information about the type of device you use and operating system version. 

We may send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to update you about any events or promotions that we may be running. If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, you turn them off at the device level. To ensure you receive proper notifications, we will need to collect certain information about your device such as operating system and user identification information. 

We collect your location based information for the purpose of mileage tracking and providing location specific features. We may share your geo-location data with third parties for the sole purpose of providing these services. If you do not wish to allow us to share your information in this manner please opt out by contacting us at [help@expensify.com](mailto:help@expensify.com). 

You may opt-out of location based services at any time by editing the setting at the device level or by emailing us at [help@expensify.com](mailto:help@expensify.com). 

We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile Software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the Application, the events that occur within the Application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the Application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile Application. 

##  3rd Party Tracking Technologies 

We and our affiliates (including but not limited to Google Analytics and New Relic) may use Identifiers and similar tracking technologies to monitor performance and usage on the site for internal analytics and performance monitoring. These Identifiers and similar tracking technologies are used to help the Site collect and store information regarding your visit, such as session state and authentication tokens. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions provided through the Expensify Service. To manage Flash cookies, please click [here](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html). 

The use of Identifiers by our affiliates is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. 

##  Behavioural Advertising 

We may partner with a third party to either display advertising on our Site or Application or to manage our advertising on other sites.
