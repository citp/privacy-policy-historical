Information collected may be used internally to create aggregate information about our users. This aggregate data may be provided to our advertisers and sponsors, without providing any personal user data. 

KCO, reserves the right to perform statistical analyses of user behaviour and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the site and to inform advertisers of such information as well as the number of users that have been exposed to or clicked on their advertising banners.

KCO is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties and users should check the applicable privacy policy of such party when providing personally identifiable information. 

Users also should be aware that non-personal information and data may be automatically collected through the standard operation of KCO, 's web servers or through the use of "cookies." "Cookies" are small text files a web site can use to recognise repeat users, facilitate the user's ongoing access to and use of the site and allow a site to track usage behaviour and compile aggregate data that will allow content improvements and targeted advertising.
