<h1>The Experience Project : Privacy Policy</h1>



<p>Last Updated November 16, 2005</p>

<p>At The Experience Project we recognize that privacy is critically important. This Policy applies to all of the services offered by The Experience Project. </p>
<p> In short, The Experience Project collects as little sensitive information as possible in order to foster an environment where our members are comfortable that they can share their experiences without being personally identified. For example,we do not ask for your given name or physical address during registration. However, for your own protection, always note that any activities on a public medium such as the internet, at our site or others, are traceable under extreme circumstances (e.g., we must comply with legitimate requests from law enforcement agencies to provide IP address data, which your internet service provider can trace back to you individually). With that being our general policy, details follow. </p>
<p>If you have any questions about this Policy, please feel free to <a href="mailto:privacy@experienceproject.com">contact us</a> through our website</p>

<p><a name="information"></a><b>Information we collect and how we use it:</b></p>

<p>We offer a number of services that do not require you to register for an account or provide any personal information to us, such as The Experience Project Search. In order to provide our full range of services, we may collect the following types of information:</p>

<ul><font size="-1">
<li><b>Information you provide</b> - When you sign up for a Experience Project Account or other Experience Project service or promotion that requires registration, we ask you for some personal information (such as your email address and an account password). 
<br><br>
</li><li><b>The Experience Project cookies</b> - When you visit The Experience Project, we send one or more cookies - a small file containing a string of characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service by storing user preferences and tracking user trends, such as how people utilize the website. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some Experience Project features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.
<br><br>
</li><li><b>Log information</b> - When you use The Experience Project's services, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
<br><br>
</li><li><b>User communications</b> - When you send email or other communication to The Experience Project, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services.
<br><br>
</li><li><b>Links</b> - The Experience Project may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been followed. We use this information to improve the quality of our search technology, customized content and advertising.
<br><br>
</li></font><li><font size="-1"><b>Other sites</b> - This Privacy Policy applies to web sites and services that are owned and operated by The Experience Project. We do not exercise control over external sites displayed as search results or links from within our various services. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you.
</font></li></ul>

<p>The Experience Project only processes personal information for the purposes described in the applicable Privacy Policy and/or privacy notice for specific services. In addition to the above, such purposes include:</p>

<ul><font size="-1">
<li>Providing our products and services to users, including the display of customized content and advertising;
</li><li>Auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services;
</li><li>Ensuring the technical functioning of our network; and
</li></font><li><font size="-1">Developing new services.
</font></li></ul>

<p><a name="infochoices"></a><b>Choices for personal information</b>
</p>
<p>When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal information.  If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use.
</p>
<p>If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Policy and/or in the specific service notices, we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes. We will not collect or use sensitive information for purposes other than those described in this Policy and/or in the specific service notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent.
</p>
<p>You can decline to submit personal information to any of our services, in which case The Experience Project may not be able to provide those services to you.
</p>
<p><a name="infosharing"></a><b>Information sharing</b>
</p>
<p>The Experience Project only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of The Experience Project in the following limited circumstances:
</p>

<ul><font size="-1">
<li>We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.
</li><li>We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
</li></font><li><font size="-1">We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable <a href="terms.php">Terms of Service</a>, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of The Experience Project, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.
</font></li></ul>

<p>If The Experience Project becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
</p>
<p>We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users who searched for a particular term, for example, or how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. Such information does not identify you individually.
</p>
<p>Please contact us at the e-mail address below for any additional questions about the management or use of personal data.
</p>
<p><a name="infosecurity"></a><b>Information security</b>
</p>
<p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.
</p>
<p>We restrict access to personal information to The Experience Project employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. 
</p>
<p><a name="dataintegrity"></a><b>Data integrity</b>
</p>
<p>The Experience Project processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.
</p>
<p><a name="access"></a><b>Accessing and updating personal information</b>
</p>
<p>When you use The Experience Project services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.
</p>
<p><a name="enforcement"></a><b>Enforcement</b>
</p>
<p>The Experience Project regularly reviews its compliance with this Policy. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Policy or The Experience Project's treatment of personal information by <a href="mailto:privacy@experienceproject.com">contacting us</a> through this web site.
</p>
<p><a name="policychanges"></a><b>Changes to this policy</b>
</p>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice. Each version of this Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date.
</p>
<p>If you have any additional questions or concerns about this Policy, please feel free to contact us any time through this web site.
