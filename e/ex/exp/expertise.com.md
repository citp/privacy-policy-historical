# Privacy Policy - Expertise

**Last Updated:  June 16th, 2015**

Welcome to Expertise! This Privacy Policy explains how information about you is collected, used and disclosed by Expertise LLC (“Expertise,” “we” or “us”) when you access or use our websites, widgets and other online products and services (collectively, the “Services”) or when you otherwise interact with us. This Privacy Policy does not, however, describe the practices of third parties that may collect information from you when you interact with them, including professionals (referred to as “Experts”). Any information provided directly to an Expert is treated in accordance with that Expert’s privacy practices and we encourage you to ask the Expert for information about their practices before providing any information to them.

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our website’s homepage or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.

## Collection of Information

We collect information you provide directly to us.

When you use our Services to find an Expert, we collect information from you, such as your name, email address, zip code, phone number, information about your project and the type of Expert you are looking for and any additional information you choose to provide.

If you use the Services as an Expert, we collect information about you and your company, including but not limited to your name, company name, address, email address, phone number, website URL, areas of expertise, prior work experience, education, qualifications, featured projects, photos, communications you have with other users through the Services and any other information you choose to provide.

## Social Sharing Features

The Services may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools (such as the Facebook “Like” button), which let you share actions you take on our Services with other media, and vice versa.

Expertise takes reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.

## Your Choices

**Account Information**

You may update, correct or delete information about you at any time by logging into your online account. If you wish to deactivate your account, you may do so by logging into your account and selecting that option under Account Settings, but note that we may retain certain information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.

You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by following the instructions in those communications. If you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account or our ongoing business relations.

**Your California Privacy Rights**

California law permits residents of California to request certain details about how their information is shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes. However, please note that under the law, a business is not required to provide this information if it permits California residents to opt into, or opt out of, this type of sharing. Expertise qualifies for this alternative option. As described above, we will not share information about you with third parties for their direct marketing purposes without your consent. In addition, you can request that we stop future disclosures of your information for direct marketing purposes by contacting us at legal@expertise.com.
