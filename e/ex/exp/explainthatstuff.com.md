# Privacy policy: Explain that Stuff!

_Last updated: November 12, 2013._

We take privacy issues seriously—and yes everyone says that, but we really do. Here (in plain English) are full details explaining the careful steps we have taken to respect and protect your privacy as you use our website.

## Site statistics and server logs

Unlike many other websites, we don't obsessively run analytics software to track our visitors; occasionally we run Google Analytics for a few days to help us diagnose technical problems, but we don't have it switched on the whole time tracking everything you do. Instead, through our website hosting company, we run a general statistical package called [AWStats](http://awstats.sourceforge.net/) to show up daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly patterns and trends. It doesn't log any personal information about you or how you use our site: it simply tells us general things about how many visitors we have, which pages they look at, and so on. Except when there are technical issues, we don't retain web server logs or the detailed information they contain, so the way you use our site is not tracked or traced.

## What are cookies?

When you look at websites, text, graphics, videos, and other computer data moves from a web server (which stores the website you're looking at and "serves" it up to you) to your web browser (the program, such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Google Chrome, or whatever you use to surf the Web). There is no easy way for a web browser to remember things about you as you move from page to page, which makes life difficult if you want to do something like putting a product in a shopping cart (trolley), select a particular size of text for the pages you're looking at, sign in to a website for a personalized experience, and so on.

That's where cookies come in. Cookies are small files that websites can store on your computer to help them remember things about you. Some cookies (known as session cookies) stay on your computer only for short periods of time; others, known as persistent cookies, may stay there for years. Some cookies, known as first-party cookies, are set by the websites you visit; others are set by services that those websites rely on (for example, advertisements, statistical tracking programs, social networking widgets and so on)—and they're known as third-party cookies. Cookies like this can be used to track a web user's progress as they move from one website to another, although they generally do so anonymously (they don't usually contain personally indentifiable information). Nevertheless, the use of cookies does raise understandable concerns about privacy. If you are worried about this, you can set up your web browser to accept or reject certain kinds of cookies and you can inspect or delete the cookies it contains at any time. We explain how to do this below.

## Cookies

We do not store cookies on your computer (or have access to any cookies that may be stored there)—but our advertisers and affiliate partners may do so.

Explainthatstuff.com does not store cookies of any kind on your computer. None at all. That means we don't offer a way for you to opt-out of having your information collected or a way to remove your personal information from our records—simply because we don't collect any information about you.

Please be aware, however, that our website runs advertisements on most pages; it is a completely free website and if it didn't run advertising, it would not exist. The advertising partners we work with use what are known as third-party cookies to help them serve up relevant, targeted advertisements that they believe may match your interests. Our partners assure us that these cookies are anonymous and do not use personally identifying information to serve advertisements to you unless you have specifically given permission for that. (Although you might raise an eyebrow at this use of cookies, we believe it is better that advertisers show you advertisements you might find interesting or useful than completely random advertisements.) We have no control over these third-party cookies. We do not see or have access to any information they may store or collect. They pass directly between your computer and the servers run by our advertisers.

At the moment, we run advertisments through Google.

Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads to you based on your prior visits to our website. Google's use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to you based on your visit to our site and/or other sites on the Internet. You may opt out of the use of the DoubleClick cookie for interest-based advertising by visiting [Google's Ads Settings](http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/) page. Alternatively, you can opt out by visiting [aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/). The cookies of other third-party vendors or ad networks may also be used to serve ads on our site and you can opt out of these cookies too by visiting [aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/). You can learn more about how Google safeguards your privacy by visiting [Google's Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/) website.

## Social networking sites

Like pages on most other modern websites, most of the pages on our site now include links to social networking and bookmarking sites (including the Facebook Like button, Google +1 button, and Twitter Tweet button) to help people remember our articles and share them with their friends. Please be aware that, depending on how you are signed into these services, they might be using cookies to track websites or pages you visit. No such information is collected by our own site and none of the information that may be collected by social networking sites is available to us: it passes directly between your computer and the social networking site(s) you belong to. If you have concerns about the privacy implications of social networking bookmarks, please visit the privacy pages of the sites or services you use:

  * [Facebook's Privacy Policy](http://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/)
  * [Google +1 Button Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/plusone/)
  * [Twitter Privacy Policy](https://twitter.com/privacy)



## UK Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003

For users in the UK and the rest of Europe, we have carefully reviewed (and continue to review) our legal obligations under the [Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2003/2426/contents/made) (revised May 2011), in line with guidance from the UK [Information Commissioner's Office](http://www.ico.gov.uk/for_organisations/privacy_and_electronic_communications/the_guide/cookies.aspx). We have done our best to provide clear information about privacy and cookies and to make it prominent on our website. We do not provide an option for you to consent to the use of cookies because our website does not store cookies. We are continuing to review the way our advertising and social-networking partners are responding to the changes in the privacy legislation and working with them in line with the guidance from the Information Commissioner that "The person setting the cookie is therefore primarily responsible for compliance with the requirements of the law. Where third party cookies are set through a website both parties will have a responsibility for ensuring users are clearly informed about cookies and for obtaining consent... It is therefore in both parties' interests to work together."

## Children's Online Privacy Protection Act

As explained above, this site collects and stores no personal information from anyone—and that includes children under the age of 13. We believe it is therefore fully compliant with the US [Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)](http://www.coppa.org/).

For a more general look at privacy issues, you might like to look at the [Electronic Frontier Foundation: Privacy](https://www.eff.org/issues/privacy) page. You might also find Simson Garfinkel's book [Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century](http://books.google.com/books?id=Mji4KPEqV3AC) interesting; though it's a little dated on specifics now, the basic issues haven't changed.
