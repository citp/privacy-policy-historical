# Privacy and cookies policy - Explain that Stuff

_Last updated: July 5, 2017._

We take privacy issues seriously—and yes everyone says that, but we really do. Here (in plain English) are full details explaining the careful steps we have taken to respect and protect your privacy as you use our website.

## What are cookies?

When you look at websites, text, graphics, videos, and other computer data moves from a web server (which stores the website you're looking at and "serves" it up to you) to your web browser (the program, such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Google Chrome, or whatever you use to surf the Web). There is no easy way for a web browser to remember things about you as you move from page to page, which makes life difficult if you want to do something like putting a product in a shopping cart (trolley), select a particular size of text for the pages you're looking at, sign in to a website for a personalized experience, and so on.

That's where cookies come in. Cookies are small files that websites can store on your computer to help them remember things about you. Some cookies (known as session cookies) stay on your computer only for very short periods of time (typically, until you close your browser); others, known as persistent cookies, may stay there for years. Some cookies, known as first-party cookies, are set by the websites you visit; others are set by services that those websites rely on (for example, advertisements, statistical tracking programs, social networking widgets and so on)—and they're known as third-party cookies. Cookies like this can be used to track a web user's progress as they move from one website to another, although they generally do so anonymously (they don't usually contain personally identifiable information). Nevertheless, the use of cookies does raise understandable concerns about privacy. If you are worried about this, you can set up your web browser to accept or reject certain kinds of cookies and you can inspect or delete the cookies it contains at any time. We explain how to do this below.

## How do we use cookies?

We use cookies for three things: to improve your experience of our site, to serve relevant personalized advertising, and for social media.

### Cookies that improve your experience of our site

Our website uses only one persistent (long-lasting) cookie (called cookieconsent_dismissed): to record the fact that you have seen our cookie warning and consented to it by clicking "OK." This cookie is stored for one year from the time when you give your consent. Our website doesn't use any other "persistent" (long-lasting) cookies and doesn't use any cookies to track you or collect personal information about you.

Although we do not generally use persistent cookies, our server will usually store one or two _temporary_ (session) cookies on your computer. These expire at the end of your session (when you close your browser):

  * Depending on which pages you're looking at, the server may store a simple cookie called PHPSESSID on your computer purely for the duration of your session. [PHPSESSID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_ID) is a technical mechanism that helps the server ensure you can browse our site efficiently when there are multiple people viewing the site at the same time. It's essentially a random string of letters and numbers that the server assigns to you so it can remember you, as you hop from page to page, and not mix up your session with other people's. This is purely an internal server mechanism: we don't use this cookie to track you in any way whatsoever and it will expire and be deleted from your computer as soon as you close your web browser.
  * Our site is hosted on a high-performance cloud grid, using many servers. It may store a temporary cookie called DYNSRV, which helps the load balancer (a mechanism that spreads the load evenly across all the servers) to figure out and remember which server is sending pages to you—so the site is served to you faster.

You can also see the typical contents of a PHPSESSID cookie: it's a simple random identifier that contains no personal information about you. The cookie expires at the end of your session, which usually means when you close your browser.

**None of these cookies (cookieconsent_dismissed, PHPSESSID, or DYNSRV) collect or store any personal information about you or track your behavior for marketing purposes in any way whatsoever**.

### Cookies that help us serve relevant, personalized advertising

Although our own server does not set persistent cookies (other than for cookie consent), please be aware that **some persistent third-party cookies are set when you visit our website**. Our site runs advertisements on most pages; it is a completely free website and if it didn't run advertising, it would simply not exist. The advertising partners we work with use what are known as persistent, third-party cookies to help them serve up relevant, targeted advertisements that they believe may match your interests, and they may share them with their own partner companies. Our partners assure us that these cookies are anonymous and do not use personally identifying information to serve advertisements to you unless you have specifically given permission for that. (Although you might raise an eyebrow at this use of cookies, we believe it is better that advertisers show you things you might find interesting or useful than completely random advertisements.) We have no control over these third-party cookies. We do not see or have access to any information they may store or collect. They pass directly between your computer and the servers run by our advertisers.

At the moment, most of our advertisements run through Google.

Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads to you based on your prior visits to our website. Google's main advertising cookie is called DoubleClick. Google's use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve personalized ads to you based on your visit to our site and/or other sites you have previously visited on the Internet. You may opt out of the use of the DoubleClick cookie for interest-based advertising by visiting [Google's Ads Settings](http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/) page. Alternatively, you can opt out by visiting [aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/) or [www.youronlinechoices.com](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/). If you want to permanently opt-out of the DoubleClick cookie, you can install the [DoubleClick opt out extension](http://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin) on your browser, which works on Firefox, Chrome, and Internet Explorer. You can learn more about [how and why Google collects and uses information](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/), and how it safeguards your privacy, by visiting [Google's Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/) website.

The cookies of other third-party vendors or ad networks may also be used to serve ads on our site and you can usually opt out of these cookies too by visiting [www.youronlinechoices.com](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/) or [aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/).

### Cookies for social media

Like pages on most other modern websites, most of the pages on our site now include links to social networking and bookmarking sites (specifically, the Facebook Like button and Google +1 button) to help people remember our articles and share them with their friends. Please be aware that, depending on how you are signed into these services, they might be using cookies to track websites or pages you visit. No such information is collected by our own site and none of the information that may be collected by social networking sites is available to us: it passes directly between your computer and the social networking site(s) you belong to. If you have concerns about privacy and social networking bookmarks, please visit the privacy pages of the sites or services you use:

  * [Facebook's Privacy Policy](http://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/)
  * [Google Buttons Policy](https://developers.google.com/+/web/buttons-policy)



As of 2017, we no longer use the "official" Twitter tweet button; the "Tweet" buttons on our pages are just ordinary web links to Twitter. Although they look like the official button, they don't use cookies and don't allow Twitter to track your browsing.

## UK Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003

European Law requires that we inform European citizens of how our website uses cookies. We have carefully reviewed our legal obligations under the [Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2003/2426/contents/made) (revised May 2011), in line with guidance from the UK [Information Commissioner's Office](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-pecr/cookies-and-similar-technologies/). It's for this reason that our site informs you that it is using cookies when you first enter it.

## Children's Online Privacy Protection Act

As explained above, this site collects and stores no personal information from anyone—and that includes children under the age of 13. We believe it is therefore fully compliant with the US [Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)](http://www.coppa.org/).

## We will not keep, sell, or otherwise misuse your email address

We value feedback from our readers **very highly** : we're trying to improve this site all the time and your thoughts and suggestions are invaluable to us. If you send us [feedback](https://web.archive.org/web/20171231121318id_/http%3A//www.explainthatstuff.com/feedback.php) or comments, we keep them and act on them, if that's appropriate. We give you the option of sending feedback anonymously, though (to prevent abuse), your IP address is sent to us at the same time, along with basic details of which browser, operating system, and so on that you're using (that helps us if you've commented about formatting problems, mobile-device usability, or things like that). If you do choose to send us your email address, we may use it to send you a reply. We don't use it for any other purpose, we don't record it anywhere, and we don't retain it. If we send you a reply, we delete that promptly too, so there is no record of your email address anywhere on our web server or email server.

## Opting out

We don't offer a way for you to opt-out of having your information collected or a way to remove your personal information from our records—simply because we don't collect any information about you!

## Site statistics and server logs

Unlike many other websites, we don't obsessively run analytics software to track our visitors; occasionally we run Google Analytics for a few days to help us diagnose technical problems, but we don't have it switched on the whole time tracking everything you do. Instead, through our website hosting company, we run a general statistical package called [AWStats](http://awstats.sourceforge.net/) to show up daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly patterns and trends. It doesn't log any personal information about you or how you use our site: it simply tells us general things about how many visitors we have, which pages they look at, and so on. Except when there are technical issues, we don't retain web server logs or the detailed information they contain, so the way you use our site is not tracked or traced.

For a more general look at privacy issues, you might like to look at the [Electronic Frontier Foundation: Privacy](https://www.eff.org/issues/privacy) page. You might also find Simson Garfinkel's book [Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century](http://books.google.com/books?id=Mji4KPEqV3AC) interesting; though it's a little dated on specifics now, the basic issues haven't changed.
