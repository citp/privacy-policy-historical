_In General_. We receive and store any information you enter on our Website or give us in any other way. This includes information that can identify you ("personal information"), including your first and last name, telephone number, postal and e-mail addresses, contact details and, in some cases, billing information (such as credit card number, cardholder name, and expiration date). We also may request information about your traveler preferences, including meal requests, seat selection, frequent flyer/hotel/car rental program information, and ticketing options. You can choose not to provide information to us, but in general some information about you is required in order for you to register as a member; purchase products or services; complete a traveler profile; participate in a survey, contest, or sweepstakes; ask us a question; or initiate other transactions on our site. 

_Passenger Information_. When you make travel or other arrangements for someone else through the Website , we will request personal information and travel preferences about that individual.

Throughout the Website, all services provided by a third-party supplier are described as such. We do not place limitations on our suppliers' use or disclosure of your personal information.

You can tell when a third party is involved in a product or service you have requested because their name will appear with ours. If you choose to access these optional services, we may share information about you, including your personal information, with those partners. Please note that we do not control the privacy practices of these third-party business partners and recommend you evaluate their practices before deciding to provide your personal information. 

·         _Companies within the Expedia family_. Sharing this information with our U.S. corporate affiliates, including Hotels.com, TripAdvisor, Hotwire, and Classic Vacations, as well as international corporate affiliates such, as Expedia.com, Expedia.uk and Expedia.de, enables us to provide you with information about products and services, both travel-related and other, which might interest you. To the extent that our corporate affiliates have access to your information, they will follow practices that are at least as restrictive as the practices described in this Privacy Policy. They also will comply with applicable laws governing the transmission of promotional communications and, at a minimum, give you an opportunity in any commercial e-mail they send to choose not to receive such e-mail messages in the future. 

We also may share your information: 

·         In response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases we reserve the right to raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.

**How we protect your information**

  
We want you to feel confident about using the Website to plan and purchase your travel, so we are committed to protecting the information we collect. While no Web site can guarantee security, we have implemented appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security procedures to help protect the personal information you provide to us. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they only may do so for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption when transmitting your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we employ firewalls and intrusion detection systems to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your information. 

Our systems are configured with data encryption, or scrambling, technologies, and industry-standard firewalls. When you send personal information to the Website over the Internet, your data is protected by Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to ensure safe transmission. 

**Children's privacy**

  
The Website does not sell travel or other services for purchase by children. Should a child whom we know to be under 13 send personal information to us, we will use that information only to respond directly to that child to inform him or her that we must have parental consent before receiving his or her personal information. 

**External Links**

  
If any part of the Website links you to other Web sites, those Web sites do not operate under this Privacy Policy. We recommend you examine the privacy statements posted on those other Web sites to understand their procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing personal information. 

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**

Expedia may update this Privacy Policy in the future.  We will notify you about material changes to this Privacy Policy by sending a notice to the e-mail address you provided to us or by placing a prominent notice on our Web site.
