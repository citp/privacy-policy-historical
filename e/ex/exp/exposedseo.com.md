# PRIVACY POLICY | Exposed seo and internet marketing

Each time you visit a website anywhere on the internet various bits of information are being collected to help webmasters track their visitors. Your privacy is very important to me. Bellow are bits of information I gather here on exposedseo.com

**Cookies** – These are parcels of text sent by a server to a web client (your browser) and then sent back unchanged by the client each time it accesses that server. Cookies are used by websites to identify users who have previously registered or visited the site. For example to keep somebody logged in without them having to enter their password over and over again in order to view each page. Even though exposedseo.com does not use cookies directly, various adverts might be show to you that may well use cookies. These will be coming from 3rd party website I have no access to.

**Server logs** – These tell me where the visitors are coming from, how long they spend browsing exposedseo.com and what kind of system they have. For example their operating system and screen resolution. I use these stats to make exposedseo.com more accessible. This data is used a whole to identify trends and log any kind of suspicious behaviour. Even though your IP address is being logged it does not actually link to any of your personal information. 3rd party statistics software can be used such as [Woopra](http://www.woopra.com/) and [Google analytics](https://web.archive.org/web/20101122072429id_/http%3A//exposedseo.com/www.google.com/analytics/). These work similar to server logs and can use cookies.

**Comments and Posts** – Your email address as well as your name/nickname are required for you to make a comment on any of the posts. This information is only used by the commentator system in order to identify you. You are responsible for any kind of personal information you make public in your comments.

**Email RSS subscription** – You can subscribe to my blog and get new posts delivered straight to your inbox. This is being handled by [Google Feedburner](http://feedburner.google.com/). Collected email are not used for anything else but to keep you updated.

**Outgoing links** – I have no control over the websites I link to. By clicking on the link you proceed at your own risk. It is your responsibility to check privacy policy of the website you are visiting.
