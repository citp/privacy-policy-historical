<h1>Privacy policy </h1>

<p><i>Last updated: May 19, 2012.</i></p>

<p>We take privacy issues seriously—everyone says that, but we <span class="italic">really</span> do.
Here (in plain English) are full details explaining the careful steps we have taken to respect and protect your privacy as you use our website.</p>

<h2>Quick summary</h2>

<p><img src="http://cdn4.explainthatstuff.com/computer-security.jpg" class="irightno" alt="A general illustration of computer security: a padlock sitting on a computer keyboard." height="225" width="300"></p>

<li><span class="bold">Explainthatstuff.com does not track or trace your web browsing in any way</span>.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Explainthatstuff.com does not store <u>any</u> cookies on your computer</span>.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Explainthatstuff.com has deliberately chosen to keep its use of other services that store ("third-party") cookies on your computer to an <u>absolute minimum</u></span>:
<ul>
<li>We do not routinely use analytical cookies to produce statistical reports about users. We use simple web server logs instead.</li>
<li>We do not use sharing widgets, which place (third-party) cookies on your computer and track your web browsing. We use our own simple sharing links instead, which operate like ordinary web links, do not track you, and do not compromise your privacy.</li>
<li>Our site is completely free to use and has to run advertising or it wouldn't exist. <span class="bold">Our advertisers use (third-party) cookies to help them serve relevant advertisements, and may store them on your computer, but they assure us these cookies are anonymous and do not use personally identifying information unless you have specifically given your permission</span>. We do not have access to these cookies or any information they may contain.</li>
<li>Our website includes social-networking buttons so you can share things you like with your friends. If you belong to a social networking site, please be aware that it may be using cookies to track you as you visit this site and other sites on the web.

<div class="main2">
<h2>Web server logs</h2>

<p>Like every other website, our site is hosted on a web server
(a powerful computer at our service provider) that keeps a <span class="bold">log</span> of all the
pages and graphics it serves and where it sends them to.
This is a basic feature of how web servers work.
The information they log is essentially anonymous and statistical: it tells us
how many people from Iceland looked at our site last Thursday, but it
doesn't tell us anything personal about them. We don't
know who those people were, whether they were fishermen or fighter
pilots, or what colour socks they were wearing at the time.</p>

<p>The logs don't tell us who you are or where you live—but they do
record your <span class="bold">IP number</span> (a number that uniquely identifies your Internet connection).
They also note what you looked at or downloaded, the operating system and browser you're
using, the date and time of your visit, how you came to our site, and
so on. Here is an example of one line from our log, recording one
hit from one visitor using the (made-up) IP number 12.34.56.78:</p>
<p><span class="pre">
12.34.56.78 - - [25/May/2010:13:05:41 +0100] "GET /transformers.html HTTP/1.0" 200 19986 "http://www.google.co.in/search?hl=en&amp;q=why+we+use+transformers&amp;meta=
&amp;aq=4m&amp;aqi=g-c1g-m4&amp;aql=&amp;oq=use+transformers&amp;gs_rfai=" "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1)"</span></p>

<p>What can we deduce from this? That someone using computer 12.34.56.78 wanted to find out "why we use transformers" at 13:05
on Tuesday May 25 2010. They used Google India to get to our site, which they viewed using a Mozilla/Firefox
browser running under Windows. That's about it. <span class="bold">The information logged here is not personally identifiable</span>,
so we don't know who made this search or why—and frankly, we don't care. We have absolutely no interest in what
individual people are doing or why.</p>

<p>How do we use this information? Contrary to what we've said, we don't actually look at our raw access logs:
a typical day's log has hundreds of thousands of entries like the one above! Instead, we run the logs through
a statistical package called <a href="http://awstats.sourceforge.net/" target="_new">AWStats</a>
to show up daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly patterns and trends in how people use our site. (If
you're really interested, you can see a <a href="http://awstats.sourceforge.net/#DEMO" target="_new">demo</a> of
the kind of statistics that we can see.) What does this tell us? If we
know certain pages are unpopular, we can improve
them or discontinue them. If we know our server is about to crash
because too many people are looking at our global warming page again, we can get a bigger
server. If we know our RSS feeds are growing in popularity, we will
start to update them more often. This is the kind of thing we do with
our logs. Broadly speaking, they help us improve our website so
it better meets your needs and identify any problems with our server
(slow-loading pages or things like that) that we need to address.</p>

<p>Our website hosting system logs activity in a single file for the current month. At the end of each month, we run our statistical analysis on the log and it is then retained for the whole of the next month before being erased. So, for example, data about visits to our site in January would be logged through January, analyzed at the beginning of February and then stored for the rest of February, before being erased at the beginning of March. The absolute maximum amount of time for which information about your visit to our site
is retained on our system is two months. (If you visit on the 31st of the month, the information is kept for only one month.)</p>
</div>

<div class="box">
<h2>What are cookies?</h2>

<p>When you look at websites, text, graphics, videos, and other computer data moves from a web server (which stores the website you're looking at and "serves" it up to you) to your web browser (the program, such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Google Chrome, or whatever you use to surf the Web). There is no easy way for a web browser to remember things about you as you move from page to page, which makes life
difficult if you want to do something like putting a product in a shopping cart (trolley), select a particular size of text for the pages you're looking at, sign in to a website for a personalized experience, and so on.</p>

<span class="question">?</span>

<p>That's where <span class="bold">cookies</span> come in.
Cookies are small files that websites can store on your computer to help them remember things about you. Some cookies (known as <span class="bold">session cookies</span>) stay on your computer only for short periods of time; others, known as <span class="bold">persistent cookies</span>, may stay there for years. Some cookies, known as <span class="bold">first-party cookies</span>, are set by the websites you visit; others are set by services that those websites rely on (for example, advertisements, statistical tracking programs, social networking widgets and so on)—and they're known as <span class="bold">third-party cookies</span>. Cookies like this can be used to track a web user's progress as they move from one website to another, although they generally do so anonymously (they don't usually contain personally indentifiable information). Nevertheless, the use of cookies does raise understandable concerns about privacy. If you are worried about this, you can set up your web browser to accept or reject certain kinds of cookies and you can inspect or delete the cookies it contains at any time. We explain how to do this below.</p>
</div>

<div class="main2">
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p><span class="bold">We do not store cookies on your computer (or have access to any cookies that may be stored there)—but our advertisers and affiliate partners may do so</span>.</p>

<p>Explainthatstuff.com does not store cookies of any kind on your computer. None at all. That means we don't offer a way
for you to opt-out of having your information collected or a way to remove your personal information from our records—simply
because we don't collect any information about you.</p>

<p>
Please be aware, however, that our website runs advertisements on most pages; it is a completely free website and if it didn't run advertising, it would not exist. The advertising partners we work with use what are known as third-party cookies to help them serve up relevant, targeted advertisements that they believe may match your interests. Our partners assure us that these cookies are anonymous and do not use personally identifying information to serve advertisements to you unless you have specifically given permission for that. (Although you might raise an eyebrow at this use of cookies, we believe it is better that advertisers show you advertisements you might find interesting or useful than completely random advertisements.) We have no control over these third-party cookies. We do not see or have access to any information they may store or collect. They pass directly between your computer and the servers run by our advertisers.</p>

<p>
At the moment, Google is the only advertiser we are working with. Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies
(including the DoubleClick DART cookie) to serve advertisements on our website. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our site and other sites on the Internet. You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the
<a target="_new" href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html">Google ad and content network privacy policy</a>.
You can learn more about how Google safeguards your privacy by visiting  <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy.html" target="_new">Google's Privacy Policy</a> website.</p>

<h2>Social networking sites</h2>
<p>
Like pages on most other modern websites, most of the pages on our site now include links to social networking and bookmarking sites
(including the Facebook Like button, Google +1 button, and Twitter Tweet button) to help people remember our articles and
share them with their friends. Please be aware that, depending on how you are signed into these services, they might be using cookies to track websites or pages you visit. <span class="bold">No such information is collected by our own site and none of the information that may be collected by social networking sites is available to us</span>: it passes directly between your computer and the social networking site(s) you belong to. If you have concerns about the privacy implications of social networking bookmarks, please visit the privacy pages of the sites or services you use:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/" target="_new">Facebook's Privacy Policy</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/plusone/" target="_new">Google +1 Button Privacy Policy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/privacy" target="_new">Twitter Privacy Policy</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>UK Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003</h2>
<p>
For users in the UK and the rest of Europe, we have carefully reviewed (and continue to review) our legal obligations under the
<a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2003/2426/contents/made" target="_new">Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003</a> (revised May 2011), in line with guidance from the UK
<a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/for_organisations/privacy_and_electronic_communications/the_guide/cookies.aspx" target="_new">Information Commissioner's Office</a>. We have done our best to provide clear information about privacy and cookies and to make it
prominent on our website. We do not provide an option for you to consent to the use of cookies because our website does not store cookies.
We are continuing to review the way our advertising and social-networking partners are responding to the changes in the privacy legislation and working with them in line with the guidance from the Information Commissioner that "The person setting the cookie is therefore primarily responsible for compliance with the requirements of the law. Where third party cookies are set through a website both parties will have a responsibility for ensuring users are clearly informed about cookies and for obtaining consent... It is therefore in both parties' interests to work together."</p>

<h2>Children's Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>

<p>As explained above, this site collects and stores no personal information from anyone—and that includes children under the age of 13. We believe it is therefore fully compliant with the US <a href="http://www.coppa.org/" target="_new">Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</a>.</p>
</div>


<div class="box">
<a name="remove"><h2>How can you control your privacy?</h2>

<p>Remember: <span class="bold">you</span> are in control: you can restrict the information that websites collect about you
very easily at any time.</p>

<p>
If you're concerned about cookies, you can change the options in your Web browser to restrict how websites can use them. You can switch off certain cookies, instruct your browser to keep them only for certain periods, or delete cookies altogether. You can set the
level of privacy controls you want by looking under Privacy in your browser's options, preferences, or settings:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="bold">Internet Explorer</span> (recent versions): Click on the gear icon on the top right. Look under Internet options &gt; Privacy. Use the slider to control cookies and set the level of privacy you prefer.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Internet Explorer</span> (older versions): Click on Tools. Look under Internet options &gt; Privacy. Use the slider to control cookies and set the level of privacy you prefer.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Firefox</span>: Look under Tools &gt; Preferences &gt; Privacy. (On some versions of Firefox, you'll need to look under Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Privacy.)</li>
<li><span class="bold">Chrome and Chromium</span>: Click on the spanner on the top right of your screen. Then look under Preferences &gt; Under the Hood &gt; Privacy &gt; Content Settings &gt; Cookies.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Safari (Macintosh)</span>: Click on the gear icon on the top right. Then look under Preferences &gt; Privacy.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Safari (iPhone and iPod Touch)</span>: Click on Settings (the gear icon) from the iPhone/iPod Home screen. Privacy is near the top. You can either use Private Browsing to stop your browser remembering anything at all or selectively control cookies under the heading "Accept Cookies."</li>
<li><span class="bold">Konqueror (Linux)</span>: Click on Settings &gt; Configure Konqueror &gt; Cookies &gt; Policy.</li>
</ul>

<p>For other browsers, look up "Privacy" or "Cookies" in the user guide.</p>

<p>Please be aware that if you switch off cookies altogether, you <span class="italic">might</span> prevent some parts of some websites (such as shopping carts and personal preferences) from working properly or you might find yourself logged out of a website and unable to access it properly. One solution is to enable cookies only for those websites you know and trust (favorite shopping sites) and disable them for all other sites. Generally, if you don't log in to websites and you don't want to buy things or set website preferences, it is safe to switch off cookies altogether; if any websites do need to use them, they will usually display a message suggesting you switch them back on.</p>

<p><img src="http://cdn4.explainthatstuff.com/firefox-dont-track.png" class="iright" alt="How to set the don't track option in the Firefox browser." height="240" width="400"></p>

<h3>Don't track, private browsing, and incognito</h3>

<p>Some modern Web browsers have other ways of securing your privacy. For example, if you look under "Privacy" in newer versions of Firefox,
you'll find a simple tick-box option "Tell websites I do not want to be tracked." (Please be aware that websites are not obliged to take any notice of this, so it's going to be less effective than blocking or deleting cookies.) Most of the common browsers also have a "private browsing" or "incognito" mode that stops any data from being collected as you move from page to page, but you probably won't be able to sign into websites if you use this option all the time. And you won't be completely incognito: your IP address will still be visible to and logged by any sites you visit.</p>

<p><span class="credit">Photo: You'll find the "Don't Track" option in Firefox under the Privacy options. You can also change the "History" setting underneath so Firefox deletes all records of your current session when you exit your browser.</span></p>
