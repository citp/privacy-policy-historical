<h1>Privacy policy </h1>

<p><i>Last updated: 10 February 2009. </i></p>

<p>
We take the issue of Internet privacy (what happens to people's personal information) very seriously.</p>

<p>Here (in plain English) are full details explaining what information our site collects from you and what happens to it after that.</p>

<h3>What information do we collect?</h3>
<p>
Like <span class="italic">every</span> other website on the Net, our site is hosted on a web server
(a powerful computer at our ISP) that keeps a <span class="bold">log</span> of all the
pages and graphics it serves and where it sends them to.
This information is essentially anonymous and statistical (it tells us
how many people from Iceland looked at our site last Thursday), but it
doesn't tell us anything personal about them. We don't
know who those people were, whether they were fishermen or fighter
pilots, or what colour socks they were wearing at the time.
</p>

<p>The logs don't tell us who you are or where you live—but they do
record your <span class="bold">IP number</span> (a
number that uniquely identifies your computer). They also note how much
information you downloaded, the operating system and browser you're
using, the date and time of your visit, how you came to our site, and
so on. 
<span class="bold">None of this information is personally identifiable</span>. We can
figure out some things about what computer 12.34.56.78 was doing at 5am
on Thursday, October 5 2007, if we really want to, but we don't know
who that computer belongs to—and frankly we've got much better things
to do with our time.
</p>
<p>How do we use this information? We view the access logs in a very
general way using a statistical package called <a href="http://awstats.sourceforge.net/" target="_new">AWStats</a>. (If
you're really interested, you can see a <a href="http://awstats.sourceforge.net/#DEMO" target="_new">demo</a> of
the kind of statistics that we can see.) What do they tell us? If we
know certain pages are unpopular, we can improve
them or discontinue them. If we know our server is about to crash
because too many people
are looking at our global warming page again, we can get a bigger
server. If we know our RSS feeds are growing in popularity, we will
start to update them more often. This is the kind of thing we do with
our logs. Broadly speaking, they help us improve our website so
it better meets your needs.</p>

<h3>We do not use cookies—but our advertisers and affiliate partners do</h3>

<p>Explainthatstuff.com does not use <span class="bold">cookies</span>
(small files stored on a web browser). That means we don't offer a way
for you to opt-out of having your information collected
or a way to remove your personal information from our records—simply
because we don't collect any information about you. None whatsoever.
</p>

<p>
Please be aware, however, that our website runs <span class="bold">advertisements</span>
on most pages and we sometimes participate in <span class="bold">affiliate programs</span>
(partnerships with online shopping websites). The advertisers and affiliate partners we work with use cookies
to help them serve up their advertisements, to track your browsing
behavior, to make it easier for you to buy things from them (for
example, if you use a shopping cart on a website, that needs a cookie to make it work), and to record the
fact that it's our website that sent the traffic to them.</p>

<p>
We have no control over these <span class="bold">"third-party cookies"</span>
(as they are known). We do not see or have access to any information
they may store or collect.
They pass directly between your computer and the servers run by our
advertisers and affiliate partners. If you would like to know more about how our
advertisers and affiliate partners may be using cookies, please refer to the privacy policies on their websites for more
information.</p>

<p>At the moment, Google and Amazon are the only advertisers and affiliate partners we are working with.
</p><ul>
<li>Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies 
(including the <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/faq.aspx" target="_new">DoubleClick DART cookie</a>) to serve advertisements on our website.
Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our site and other sites on the Internet.
You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the <a target="_new" href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html">Google ad and content network privacy policy</a>.
You can learn more about how Google safeguards your privacy by visiting  <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy.html" target="_new">Google's Privacy Policy</a>
website.
</li> 
<li>For detailed information about Amazon's use of cookies and personal information, please visit the
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/privacy" target="_new">Amazon.com Privacy Notice</a> page.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<h3>How can you control your privacy?</h3>
<p>
If you're concerned about cookies, you can change the options in your
Web browser to restrict
how websites can use them. You can switch off certain cookies, instruct
your browser to keep them only for certain periods, or delete cookies
altogether. You can set the
level of privacy controls you want by looking under Privacy
in your browser's options, preferences, or settings. Please be aware
that if you do this you may prevent some parts of some websites (such as shopping carts and personal preferences) 
from working properly.</p>

<h3>How can you find out more about privacy issues?</h3>
<p>
These sites may help you:

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/cookie.htm" target="_new">How Cookies Work</a>: From Howstuffworks.</li>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie" target="_new">HTTP cookies</a>: Wikipedia has a fairly lengthy explanation of the issue and links to further information.</li>
</ul>

<p>
We hope this answers any concerns you have about privacy. If you have any further queries, please don't hesitate to contact us at the email address shown on our <a href="aboutus.html">about us</a> page.
