Please take a moment to review this privacy notice and feel free to contact us with any questions at [privacy@consumerinfo.com](mailto:privacy@consumerinfo.com).

**WHAT TYPES OF INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU?**

We require this verification in order to provide you with your personal credit information.
  * Credit information we receive from credit reporting agencies is utilized to provide you with the products we offer.
  * Billing information, such as credit card number, is required to process the payment for the products you order from us.

E-mail addresses are collected and used to send you notifications, special offers and our latest e-newsletter via electronic mail.



We will also collect certain information arising out of your use of our web site, or augment the data we collect with other information from other online or offline sources. We reserve the right to collect information about you and store it in connection with other online or offline information we may possess or obtain about you.

For your protection, our customer care representatives may request supporting documents before making any changes or updates to your membership information. 

**DO WE SHARE INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES?**  
**We do not share information with any non-affiliated third party except:** (1) in select circumstances when a business partner refers you to us and you give us permission to share specific information, such as your name and email address, with that business partner on your order form, or (2) as permitted or required by law, such as inquires by law enforcement or to comply with Federal laws such as the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 (CAN-SPAM Act of 2003) or the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACTA).

If you choose, we may disclose the information that we collect to our affiliated companies from time to time for marketing purposes and to enhance our products to better suit your needs. When identifying methods of improving our products or if we think a product may be of interest to you, we may arrange to extend select special offers of goods or products to you either directly or through affiliates. If you would like to opt-out of having your information shared with partners and/or affiliates, please refer to the section labeled “Offering You Choices - Marketing Options,” below.

In order to provide the products you have requested, we may disclose the information we collect to companies that perform services on our behalf such as the national credit reporting agencies from which we obtain your credit report(s), e-mail communications management firms or call center providers. Our third party service providers are contractually limited to using the information received from ConsumerInfo.com, Inc. solely for the purposes of providing you with the products you requested.

Our Sites may contain links for other offers and products that we feel you may have an interest in. We believe these sites share a similar commitment to consumer privacy and urge you to review their privacy policy when visiting their sites. We cannot, however, be responsible for their privacy practices.

You will be notified by means of notice on our Sites for thirty (30) days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.
