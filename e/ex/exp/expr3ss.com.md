  • archiving purposes in the public interest;

  • scientific or historical research purposes; or 

  •  statistical purposes. 

**Data Breaches**

Expr3ss! will manage all data breaches in accordance with the mandatory Notifiable Data Breaches Scheme (NDB Scheme) in Australia, as well as the mandatory notification obligations under the GDPR. 

_Obligations of Expr3ss! under the NDB Scheme_

In accordance with the NDB Scheme, in the event of a suspected data breach Expr3ss! will:

  • contain the breach and, if possible, take remedial action; and 

  • commence the requisite assessment process to determine whether the data breach is likely to be an “eligible data breach” for the purposes of the NDB Scheme. An “eligible data breach” being one where:

    ◊ there is unauthorised access to, unauthorised disclosure of, or loss of, personal information held by it;

    ◊ the access, disclosure or loss is likely to result in “serious harm” to any of the individuals to whom the information relates. In this context, “serious harm” refers to serious physical, psychological, emotional, financial or reputational harm to an individual or individuals; and

    ◊ Expr3ss! has not been able to prevent the likely risk of serious harm with remedial action.

If Expr3ss! has reasonable grounds to believe that an “eligible data breach” has occurred, it will:

  • prepare a statement to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) as soon as practicable (OAIC Statement); 

  • notify the individual to whom the information relates as soon as practicable after the statement has been prepared; and

  • provide that individual with a copy of the OAIC Statement. 

If Expr3ss! is unable to locate the individual to whom the eligible data breach relates for the purpose of providing them with a copy of the OAIC Statement, a copy of the OAIC Statement will be posted on our website. 

_Obligations under the GDPR_

In accordance with the GDPR, Expr3ss! will ensure that:

  • on becoming aware of a data breach, it will:

    ◊ attempt to contain it and assess the potential adverse consequences for individuals involved; and

    ◊ if, after conducting an assessment, it considers that:

    † there is a risk to an individual’s rights and freedoms as a result of the personal data breach, it will report the breach to the relevant Supervisory Authority without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of the breach; and

    † there is a high risk to an individual’s rights and freedoms as a result of the personal data breach, it will report the breach to the relevant Supervisory Authority in accordance with the clause above and notify the individual affected without undue delay.

Expr3ss! will keep a record of all personal data breaches, regardless of whether or not they need to be reported to the Supervisory Authority. 

Expr3ss! will not report a personal data breach in the event that, after conducting an assessment, we consider that the risk of harm to an individual’s rights and freedoms is unlikely. 

A “personal data breach” for the purposes of the GDPR includes, but is not limited to, whenever any personal data is lost, destroyed, corrupted or disclosed; if someone accesses the data or passes it on without proper authorisation; or if the data is made unavailable, for example, when it has been encrypted by ransomware, or accidentally lost or destroyed.

**Contracts With Third Party Data Processors**

In the event that Expr3ss! engages a data processor to process the personal data of European Residents on its behalf, it will only do so if that data processor has provided Expr3ss! with sufficient guarantees that it will implement appropriate technical, contractual and organisational measures that ensure compliance with the GDPR, and the protection of the personal information of European Residents.

To the extent that Expr3ss! engages a third party data processor, it will ensure that it enters into a written agreement with that data processor, which sets out, as a minimum, terms which require the processor to:

  • only act on the written instructions of Expr3ss! as the data controller;

  • ensure that people processing the data are subject to a duty of confidence;

  • take appropriate measures to ensure the security of processing;

  • only engage sub-processors with the prior consent of Expr3ss! and under a written contract;

  • assist the controller in providing subject access and allowing data subjects to exercise their rights under the GDPR;

  • assist Expr3ss! in meeting its GDPR obligations in relation to the security of processing, the notification of personal data breaches and data protection impact assessments;

  • delete or return all personal data to Expr3ss! as requested at the end of the contract; and

  • submit to audits and inspections, provide Expr3ss! with whatever information it needs to ensure that they are both meeting their Article 28 obligations, and tell Expr3ss! immediately if it is asked to do something infringing the GDPR or other data protection law of the EU or a member state.

Site, or you may request access to your personal information at any time by sending a written request to our Privacy Officer by mail at Expr3ss!

Exceptions include where:

  • giving access would have an unreasonable impact on the privacy of other individuals;

  • the access would be unlawful.

  • the right to receive personal data you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format, including the right to request that we transmit this data directly to another data controller;

  • the right to require us to erase your data in certain circumstances.

In the event that a European Resident requests that their data be erased, Expr3ss! will assess this request against any relevant record keeping obligations it has under any statute or regulation, and retains the right to seek professional advice in respect of any conflict of law issues that might arise as a result of the initial assessment before the European Resident’s request for erasure is granted.
