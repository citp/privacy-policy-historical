                    We are strongly committed to privacy and believe that good privacy is good business. Therefore, we have

                    directly from the website or through our <a href="/terms">Terms of Service</a>.
                    This Privacy Policy covers only the information collected on our website. It does not apply to any
                    information collected offline. Please note that you cannot register for our service if you are under 18

                <h2>Information collection</h2>


                <h3>1. Personal Information</h3>
                <p>
                We request that you provide us with personal information when you subscribe to our services. This
                information may include among other things your name, address, email, password, occupation and any
                information you provide to us while using our services. We collect this information to allow our systems
                to function properly. We may also collect other information in connection with your log-in to and use of
                services and products on our website. This information may include IP address, type of browser and
                operating system and any other information that results from your interaction with our products or
                services. We do not presently nor will in the future share any personal information (whether provided to
                us or collected by us) with any Third Party.
                </p>
                <h3>2. Cookies</h3>
                <p>
                We use browser “cookies” to maintain session information and to allow for “remember me” function. None
                of the information in the cookies contains any personal or sensitive information about you. Please note
                that while most browsers will accept cookies by default, you may set your browser to reject cookies.
                However, disabling cookies in your browser will render our application inoperable.

                <h3>3. Financial Information</h3>
                <p>
                We collect your financial information so that we can be compensated for paid services. We store this
                information with an industry trusted third party financial institution. This prevents any potential
                theft of such information even in the unlikely event of a security breach. The security of your
                financial data while in transmission is assured through a 128-bit Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection
                between our Web server and a third party financial institution responsible for processing credit card
                transactions.
                </p>
                <h3>4. Contact List Information</h3>

                You must comply with the <a href="/terms">Terms of Service</a> and Use Agreement when you provide the contact details of your
                target audience to us. We reserve the right to monitor this information at any time in order to ensure
                your compliance with our <a href="/terms">Terms of Service</a>. We also reserve the right to collect additional information
                about your contacts, including but not limited to IP address, browser type, email, client type and
                operating system. We do not presently nor will in the future share any contact information (whether
                provided to us or collected by us through subscription forms) with any Third Party. Contact list
                information is used strictly to fulfill the functionality of our systems.
                </p>
                <h3>5. Non-personally Identifiable Information</h3>
                <p>
                Our website may collect non-personally identifiable information. This may include, for example,
                collecting statistical information about the type of browsers people use to visit our website, domains
                from which our visitors come, or number of visits to our website, etc. This non-identifiable aggregate
                information may be used internally for quality control or for marketing purposes as well as provided to
                Third Parties.
                </p>
                <h3>6. Keeping personal information up to date</h3>
                <p>

                <p>
                Please refer to Section 4 of the Terms of Service and Use Agreement to review the list of prohibited
                content. You may not use ExpressPigeon systems to send e-mails that include or link to any prohibited
                content. We reserve the right to monitor the content of your emails to ensure compliance with our Terms
                of Service, and freeze or even permanently close your account if we deem your content inappropriate,
                based solely on our opinion.
                </p>
                <h3>8. Exception from Coverage</h3>
                <p>
                This Privacy Policy places no duty upon us with respect to Confidential Information that (a) becomes
                generally known to the public without violation of this Policy; (b) is collected by us from a third
                party without a confidentiality obligation; (c) was independently developed by us without use of the
                Confidential Information; (d) is disclosed in response to a court or governmental order provided that we
                have given you prior written notice and opportunity to object; (e) to the extent that disclosure of such
                Confidential Information is necessary to enforce our rights under the Terms of Service and Use Agreement
                in connection with any litigation, arbitration or other dispute resolution procedure.
                </p>
                <h3>9. Information Protection</h3>
                <p>
                We represent that we will use commercially reasonable measures to maintain appropriate technical and
                organizational structure to protect any information, including personally-identifiable information that
                we collect, process or access against unauthorized or illegal processing or transfer and against
                accidental loss, access, or destruction.
                </p>
                <h3>10. Changes to this policy</h3>
                <p>

                to come back to review the latest version.

                <p>
                The ExpressPigeon, Inc. duty to protect Confidential Information shall survive the expiration or
                termination of the Terms of Service and Use Agreement for any reason and will extend for a period of 5
                (five) years from the date of disclosure by you or collection by us of Confidential Information.
