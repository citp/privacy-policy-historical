We may also use information that we receive about you from your employer and data providers who assist us in processing requests, maintaining our data, and optimizing our services.

### SHARING YOUR INFORMATION

We will not disclose your Personally Identifying Information to third parties except as described in this Policy, to the extent necessary to provide you with a requested service, or under circumstances required by law. You agree that we may also disclose this information to third parties: (1) when we have reason to believe that such disclosure is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, customers or other users of our sites, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities; or (2) to respond to judicial process and provide information to law enforcement agencies or in connection with an investigation on matters related to public safety, as permitted by law, or otherwise as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process. Please note that we may be required to release an individual’s personal information in response to a legal inquiry from public authorities including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

We may transfer your Personally Identifying Information to third party service providers that assist us with carrying out these purposes. For example, we may use a data processing contractor to operate computer systems on our behalf, for administrative, technical support, or other business purposes as necessary to facilitate our transactions with you, analyze our data, conduct analytics services, or to maintain and improve our services. Whenever any Personally Identifying Information is transferred to a such a third party service provider, that party will be contractually bound to use such Personally Identifying Information only to carry out the services we have requested, to abide by our Policy, and to provide adequate protection for the Personally Identifying Information.

We reserve the right to transfer any Personally Identifying Information we have about you in the event that we merge with or are acquired by a third party. We may disclose your Personally Identifying Information for any other purpose with your consent. We may be liable for the transfer of personal information to third parties.

### YOUR CHOICES FOR CONTROLLING YOUR INFORMATION

#### Correcting or Changing Your Information

We acknowledge the individual’s right to access their personal data. We are concerned about the accuracy, currency, and completeness of the Personally Identifying Information we collect and take appropriate steps to ensure that the information we have is accurate and up-to-date. In addition to the options provided to you in this Policy, if you wish to review, amend, correct, update, or delete Personally Identifying Information we have collected about you online, or to opt out of receiving our marketing communications, contact us at: +1-866-376-4685 or [https://www.expertvoice.com/contact.](https://www.expertvoice.com/contact/)

You may also contact us by writing to:  
ExpertVoice  
Attn: Expert Success  
9 Exchange Plaza, Suite 1000  
Salt Lake City, Utah 84111

We will respond to your access request within any legally required time period or within 30 days. We reserve the right not to allow access to your information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is prohibited by law or if the rights of another individual might be violated.

You may cancel your registration to our sites and/or request the removal of your Personally Identifying Information from our visitor records by sending an email at [https://www.expertvoice.com/contact](https://www.expertvoice.com/contact/).

We will send an email to confirm your request. After you respond, we will remove your information from our database.

We reserve the right to maintain information on registered visitors who have violated any of our policies or who have had their access to the site blocked

### SECURITY

We use a variety of technologies and processes to protect Personally Identifying Information collected on the sites, including physical, technological, and organizational security measures. For example, we use encryption technology whenever transmitting personal information. Unfortunately, no security technology is completely secure, and you should remember that email is not a secure means of communication. We retain Personally Identifying Information that we collect only as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or to meet any legal requirements.

Some or all of the Personally Identifying Information we collect may be stored or processed on servers located outside of your country, including in the United States, whose data protection laws may differ from those where you live. As a result, this information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in those jurisdictions according to laws in those jurisdictions. Subject to applicable laws in such other jurisdictions, we will use reasonable efforts to ensure that appropriate protections are in place to maintain protections on the Personally Identifying Information that are equivalent to those in your country.

### LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES

Our sites may contain links to websites owned by third parties. Information you share with a third party site is not subject to this Policy. Please review the privacy policy of any sites you access through our sites.

### CHILDREN'S PRIVACY

Our sites are not intended for use by children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. Children under the age of 18 are prohibited from creating an online profile.

### POLICY CHANGES

If our Policy changes, we will post these changes to our sites with the date of revision. We encourage you to review our Policy periodically. Your continued access to and/or use of the sites after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of, and agreement to be legally bound by, this Policy, as revised. If our privacy practices, including the ways we use your Personally Identifying Information, materially change from the time you created an online profile, we will notify you about such changes before they take effect and allow you to delete your information as described above, should you disagree with such changes.
