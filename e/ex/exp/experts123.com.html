Session data consists of things such as IP address,           operating system and type of browser software being used and the activities           conducted by the user while on our Website(s). An IP address is a number that           lets computers attached to the Internet, such as our web servers, know where to           send data back to the user, such as the pages of the website the user wishes to           view. We collect session data because it helps us analyze such things as what           items visitors are likely to click on most, the way visitors are clicking           through the website, how many visitors are surfing to various pages on the           website, how long visitors to the website are staying and how often they are           visiting. We also record the URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) of the websites           you have visited prior to arriving at our Website(s) and the URLs of the           destinations you visit after you leave our Website(s). Collecting this           information also helps us diagnose problems with our servers and lets us better           administer our systems. You should know it is possible to determine from an IP           address a visitor's Internet Service Provider (ISP) and the approximate           geographic location of his or her point of connectivity. Third-party advertising           companies may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness           of ads.</p>      <h2>          Telephone Tracking Data</h2>      <p class="legal-section">          If a user (including both Registered Users and visitors) places a telephone call           to a number provided by our Website(s), we and/or our advertising partners may           record, track and or meter the telephone number of originating the call on our           own behalf or on behalf of others offering products or services on our           Website(s). We and/or our advertising partners may also store referring           telephone numbers.</p>      <h2>          Other</h2>      <p class="legal-section">          From time to time we may add or enhance services available on our Website(s). To           the extent these services are provided and used by you, we will use the           information you provide to facilitate the service requested. For example, if you           email us with a question, we will use your email address, name, nature of the           question, etc. to respond to your question. We may also store such information           to assist us in making our Website(s) the better and easier to use.</p>      <h2>          Information Other Websites Collect From You</h2>      <p class="legal-section">          On our Website(s), we place links to other web sites operated by other parties.           Some of these other web sites contain our brand names and trademarks and other           intellectual property that we own; others do not. When you click on these links           and visit these other web sites, regardless of whether or not they contain our           brand names, trademarks and other intellectual property, you need to be aware           that we do not control these other web sites or these other web sites' business           practices, and that this privacy policy does not apply to these other web sites.           Consequently, the operators of these other web sites may collect different kinds           of information about you, and may use and disclose that information in different           ways than we would if it were collected on our Website(s). We encourage you to           review their privacy policies and remind you that we will not be responsible for           their actions.</p>      <h2>          Sharing Your Information</h2>      <p class="legal-section">          When you use our Website(s) or provide us with information, we may share           personal information among our corporate affiliates at Experts123, LLC.           including, but not limited to our affiliates. For example, if you submit a           review or rating, we may share your review with our other Website(s), as well as           unaffiliated users of such data including suppliers, advertisers, affiliates and           other current and potential business partners. We may also use such aggregate           data to inform these third parties as to the number of people who have seen and           clicked on links to their web sites. Occasionally, we may hire a third party to           act on our behalf for projects such as market-research surveys and will provide           information to these third parties specifically for use in connection with these           projects.</p>      <p class="legal-section">          In addition to the circumstances described above, we may disclose your           information as part of a validation process in the interest of preventing fraud,           to provide proper accounting to our business partners (for advertising listings           and related programs) and to validate our business metrics including number of           clicks, referrer logs and other tracking information. We may also disclose your           information if required to do so by law, court order, as requested by other           government or law enforcement authority, or in the good faith belief that           disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable including, without limitation, to           protect our rights or properties of our affiliated companies or when we have           reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to identify,           contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing interference           with our rights or properties, whether intentionally or otherwise, or when           anyone else could be harmed by such activities. In addition, if Experts123, LLC           or substantially all of its assets are acquired, our customer information will           most likely also be transferred in connection with such acquisition.</p>      <h2>          Demographic Information and Saved Listings</h2>      <p class="legal-section">          We use demographic and listing information to customize our Website(s) and           communications to the interests of our users.
