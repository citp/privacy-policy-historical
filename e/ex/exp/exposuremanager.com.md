**Overview**  
ExposureManager needs to track certain user information in order for its application to work. This page outlines what is being used, how it is used and how we promise not to use it.

**Personal information and e-mail addresses**  
During signup ExposureManager will ask for your name, e-mail address and time zone. Your name is used in communication from us to you, and it is entirely up to you what you enter in those fields. Your e-mail address is used in case you have forgotten your login name and/or password. We would appreciate a valid e-mail address in this field. We will not use your e-mail address to send you third party information nor will we give or sell your information to other parties.

The time zone information is used to correctly display comments and statistics of your galleries and photos.
