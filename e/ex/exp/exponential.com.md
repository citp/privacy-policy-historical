# Privacy - Exponential

We deliver advertisements from hundreds of Advertisers across a multitude of Digital Content Provider properties. When you visit one of these properties, our automated system collects “click stream data” related to your visit to the property. Click stream data can include information such as your IP address, device identifier, operating system, browser type and language, content or pages viewed, the date and time at which that content was viewed and any interaction with content and advertisements on those properties. Technologies used to collect this click stream data include cookies and Web beacons.

We sometimes also augment this click stream data with behavioral and demographic data from Digital Content Providers and other partners. This data may include such things as postal code, age and gender. It may also include GPS location provided by Digital Content Providers with mobile properties. We require any third parties we work with to respect all applicable laws and the same self-regulatory principles that we do.

We do not use, store or collect information such as name, email address, telephone number or postal address.

The purpose of any data collection is straightforward – to show the most relevant advertisement to a user. We therefore utilize the information described above to better customize the sort of advertisements you see, typically by building models based on the types of user who, overall, are more likely to respond to a particular advertisement versus another.

We also use the data for non-targeting reasons such as frequency capping, fraud prevention, reporting statistics and billing, within the permissions of the NAI/DAA Principles and EDAA Framework.

Our tracking cookies are programmed to expire in ninety days from the last time we encounter you, at which point the web browser will delete them automatically.

Click stream data is stored in log files, which are retained in our systems for 24 months for billing purposes, and are not used for targeting. 

We enable consumer choice and control over our third party tracking cookie, which enables us to provide relevant advertising via behavioural targeting on desktop and mobile web browsers. In Europe, we require Advertisers and Digital Content Providers with whom we work to include this cookie within their legally-required cookie consent mechanisms.
