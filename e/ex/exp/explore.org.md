# explore - cultural and educational films and photos

Effective and revised as of June 15, 2009

Welcome to the explore.org website. Because your privacy is very important to us, we want you to understand our practices with regard to collecting and using your information both online and offline and the steps we take to safeguard it. The website found at [www.explore.org]( "http://www.explore.org") and each of its components and subdomains and its mobile version, if any, and the services, products and networks found at or related thereto (collectively referred to as the “Site”) is owned and operated by explore Annenberg, LLC (“explore”). 

This Privacy Policy applies to Personally Identifiable Information collected from our visitors. When this Privacy Policy uses the term “Personally Identifiable Information” it refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are and can be used to identify, contact or locate you. When you register to become a registered user of the Site, you will be asked to provide certain Personally Identifiable Information such as your name, email address and your birth date. Personally Identifiable Information may also include your mailing address, telephone number, mobile phone number, and other identification and contact information. With this information, we can fill certain of your requests and better provide you with personalized services.

“Non Personally Identifiable Information” refers to information that does not identify a specific individual by itself or in combination with other information. This information may be compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. This information may include the Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) of the website from which you just came, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address. A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the Internet. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (“TCP/IP”) network, such as the Internet. Networks use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Internet, allowing Internet servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop. 

We welcome any and all questions and feedback. For privacy-related issues, please contact us at [more@explore.org](mailto:more@explore.org).

It is our policy not to collect Personally Identifiable Information from any person under 13 because we do not allow children under the age of 13 to become registered members or to submit any Personally Identifiable Information to us through the Site. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register on the Site or send any Personally Identifiable Information about yourself. If we learn that we have inadvertently gathered Personally Identifiable Information from a child under 13, we shall attempt to notify such child’s parent or guardian and will erase such information from our records as soon as possible, unless the child’s parent or guardian consents to our maintaining such information.
