# Privacy Statement | Exit Games

At Exit Games, we respect and protect the privacy of our customers and those who use our Web sites. Our Privacy Statement provides details of our approach to privacy and how information is collected and used regarding Exit Games business contacts, Exit Games corporate web page and Exit Games Arena. 

## We protect your information

We protect the confidentiality and security of your personal information by using industry-recognized security safeguards such as firewalls, coupled with carefully developed security procedures to protect your information from loss, misuse or unauthorized alteration.  
Our employees are required to safeguard your information and, using physical, electronic and procedural safeguards, we restrict access to personal information to those employees and agents for business purposes only. Additionally, we use internal and external resources to review the adequacy of our security procedures. 

## We tell you how we intend to use your information.

When we ask you for information, we tell you, or it will be clear, what we need to fulfill your request and how we will use the information. 

## We do not sell or rent your personal information to anyone.

We do not share your personal information with third parties for their promotional use. 

## We have limited relationships with third parties.

Sometimes we enter into contracts with third parties so that they can provide our services under their brand label. In such a contract, we will sometimes provide the minimum necessary information to the other firm so that they can bill for services rendered. The contracts prohibit them from using any of your personal information for their own purposes, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information we provide to them. We may disclose or report personal information in limited circumstances where we believe in good faith that disclosure is required under the law. For example, we may be required to disclose personal information to cooperate with regulators or law enforcement authorities, to comply with a legal process such as court order, subpoena, search warrant or law enforcement request. 

## You will receive no unsolicited marketing or promotional email or mailings from us.

At any time, you can let us know whether or not you want to receive promotional material from us about our products or services. We want to provide you only the information you want. If you do not wish to receive such material, you can specify your preference during the information collection process or by emailing us at [info@exitgames.com](mailto:info@exitgames.com). 

## You can change your information.

You can update or correct your contact information by emailing us at [info@exitgames.com](mailto:info@exitgames.com). 

## You can contact us with privacy questions.

At Exit Games, we do what we say and say what we do. If you have privacy related questions that are not addressed here, please contact us at [info@exitgames.com](mailto:info@exitgames.com).
