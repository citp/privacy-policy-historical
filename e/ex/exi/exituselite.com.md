We need to know your basic personal data consisting of contact information for purposes of responding to your inquiry on one of our contact us web pages and/or Opt-In capture pages, where you requested to receive information.  We collect your name, email address, and in some cases your phone number.  We use the consent method of double opt-in, meaning once you provide your contact information to us, we send you an email to confirm your request.  In order for you to receive the information you have requested, you will be required to select consent to receive emails from Exitus Elite, or an Affiliate Member.  

Only after you have explicitly given your consent to receive information via the email address you provide and/or be contacted through the phone number that you provide, will you then start to receive the information requested or be contacted by Exitus Elite and/or an Affiliate Member.
