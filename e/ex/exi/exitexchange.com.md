Web pages rely on advertising to provide you with content that is free of charge or at a nominal cost. Advertising also plays an important role in helping consumers make informed decisions about products and services. 

ExitExchange® is a leading provider of centralized ad management services. We deliver ads on the Internet, linking website visitors with ads that are relevant to their interests and needs. Our customers are websites, advertisers and ad agencies.

At no time during the ad delivery process does ExitExchange® collect any personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, street or email address, or phone number.

In the course of serving ads, ExitExchange® collects certain non-personally identifiable data by placing a ‘cookie’ (a small file containing a unique, randomly selected alphanumeric tag) on a consumer’s computer hard drive. The non-personally identifiable information collected in connection with a cookie includes: 

  * IP Address of the machine (browser/proxy) connecting to ExitExchange® 
  * browser type (i.e., IE 3.x, etc.) 
  * operating system (i.e., Macintosh, PC, etc.)
  * date a particular ad was served 
  * time a particular ad was served 
  * advertisement tag (placed by a website on a web page to call up an ad) 



This data allows us to measure and report information to our customers, such as the number of browsers who see an ad, the number of people who click on an ad, and how many times we delivered an ad. We may aggregate and use this data internally for statistical and reporting purposes.
