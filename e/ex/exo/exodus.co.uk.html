<p>Exodus Travel Ltd's Privacy Policy sets out what information we collect, how we collect it, and what we do with it.   </p><h3>INFORMATION ABOUT YOU   </h3><p><b>Your Information</b><br>This refers to information such as your name, contact details, travel preferences and special needs/disabilities/dietary requirements that you supply us or is supplied to us, including any information about other persons on your booking ("your information"). Your information is collected when you request information from us, contact us (and vice versa) or make a booking. You are responsible for ensuring that other members of your party are aware of the content of our Privacy Policy and consent to your acting on their behalf in all your dealings with us.</p>  <p>We will update your information whenever we can to keep it current, accurate and complete.</p><p><b>Our use of your Information</b><br>(1) Our primary goal in collecting your information is to provide you with a great personalised, relevant and user-friendly experience in all your contact with Exodus.<br>(2) For the purpose of providing you with our services, including your flight, holiday or insurance, etc., we may disclose and process your information outside the UK/EEA. In order for you to travel abroad, it may be <b>mandatory</b> (as required by government authorities at the point(s) of departure and/or destination) to disclose and process your information for immigration, border control, security and anti-terrorism purposes, or any other purposes which they determine appropriate. These requirements may differ depending on your destination and you are advised to check. Even if not mandatory, we may exercise our discretion to assist where appropriate.<br>(3) We may collect and process your information for the purposes set out in our registration with the Office of the Information Commissioner, and disclose the same to our group companies for business purposes and also to companies who act as "data processors" on our behalf, or to our service providers operating systems or business functions on our behalf (some of whom are located outside the UK/EEA). These business purposes include administration, providing services (and contacting you where necessary), customer care, service quality, business management and operation, re-organisation/structuring/sale of our business (or group companies), risk assessment, security, fraud and crime prevention/detection, monitoring, research and analysis, marketing, customer purchasing preferences and trends, dispute resolution, credit checking and debt collection. <br>(4) Information (such as health or religion) may be considered "sensitive personal data" under the Data Protection Act 1998. We collect it to cater to your needs or act in your interest, and we are only prepared to accept sensitive personal data on the condition that we have your <b>positive consent</b>. By booking with us you also agree for your insurers, their agents and medical staff to disclose <b>relevant </b>information and sensitive personal data to us in circumstances where we need to act on your behalf or in the interest of passengers or in an emergency. </p>  <p><i>If you do not agree to Our Use of Your Information above, we cannot do business with you or accept your booking.</i></p><p> <b>Direct Marketing Material  </b><br>(1) We may from time to time contact you with information on offers of goods and services, brochures, new products, forthcoming events or competitions from our holiday divisions and our group companies. Our websites will assume you to agree to e-communications when you make a booking. <br>(2) If do not wish to receive such information or would like to change your preference, please refer to point (2) of "Your Rights" below. </p>  <p><b>Posting your Images on our Website<br></b>(1) You have the option to upload your holiday images on to our website once you have opened a ‘My Exodus' account. Who sees your photos is determined by the settings you select in your ‘My Exodus' account. You may choose to send an email to your ‘Friends' including a link to your photo album(s) saved in you're ‘My Exodus' account. To enable this link to be forwarded to your friends you will need to supply an email address for your friend(s). Exodus will not use the friend's email address supplied for marketing purposes. When you choose to share your online images with Friends, those individuals will be able to view your album. Please note, as with any email, your friends could forward the email invitation to others, who will then be able to click on the link to the album within the email, and see the pictures too. <br>(2) You may choose to ‘Share your album with everyone' and thereby publish your album on the Exodus Website by assigning it a 3-character trip code. Your album will then be displayed in the Images section for that trip and will potentially be visible to anyone that visits the Website.<br>(3) Exodus employees or employees of partner companies that provide services to Exodus may see your photos even if they are not published on the Website as a result of carrying out maintenance on the Website or correcting problems with your account.   </p><p><b><b>Your Rights</b><br> </b>(1) On completing our Data Subject Access Request form, you are entitled to a copy of the information we hold about you (for a £10 fee) and to correct any inaccuracies. <br>(2) You have the right to ask in writing not to receive direct marketing material from us. Please write to Louisa Richardson, Exodus Travels, Grange Mills, Weir Road, London, SW12 0NE or email <a href="mailto:mktg@exodus.co.uk" target="_blank">mktg@exodus.co.uk</a>. <br>You can unsubscribe from our marketing emails at any time using the unsubscribe link at the bottom. Once properly notified by you, we will take steps to stop using your information in this way.<br>(3) For a list of our group companies or brands, please write to TUI UK Limited, Legal Department, TUI Travel House, Crawley Business Quarter, Fleming Way, Crawley, West Sussex RH10 9QL.</p><p><b>Foreign Controls</b><br>Outside the European Economic Area (EEA), note that controls on data protection in such countries may not be as strong as the legal requirements in this country.</p><h3>USE OF TOOLS/"Cookies" and Links to Other Websites</h3><p>If our contact and dealing with you is via our website(s), we may use "cookies". Cookies allow us to identify your computer but not you personally. You can set your web browser to refuse cookies. However, you may not be able to enjoy all the facilities or book via our website if you do so.<br>However, if you also receive our email marketing, we will tailor the information we send you unless to tell us not to. This means we may use information we hold and cookies to identify your individual web site search behaviour and preferences. This will enable us to send you more personalised and relevant communications.
