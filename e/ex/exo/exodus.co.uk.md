# Privacy policy & statement on cookies | Exodus

DON'T PANIC! Exodus uses cookies to help us recognise and remember you... from auto-loading the booking form to providing a page cache that is relevant to you. Please read our Statement on Cookies

Exodus Travels Ltd's Privacy Policy sets out what information we collect, how we collect it, and what we do with it. Our Privacy Policy applies to you and is available on our website and through other channels. In all your dealings with us you must ensure that others you represent are aware of the content of our Privacy Policy and consent to your acting on their behalf.

### INFORMATION ABOUT YOU

**Your Information**

This refers to a combination of information such as your name, contact details, travel preferences and special needs/disabilities/dietary requirements that you supply us or is supplied to us, including your social preferences, interests and activities and any information about other persons you represent (such as those on your booking). Your information is collected when you request information from us, contact us (and vice versa),  make a booking, use our website(s)/apps, link to or from our website(s)/apps, connect with us via social media and any other engagement we or our business partners have with you.

We will update your information whenever we can to keep it current, accurate and complete.

**Our use of your Information**

  1. For the purpose of providing you with our services, including your flight, holiday, security, incident/accident management or insurance, etc., we may disclose and process your information outside the UK/EEA. In order for you to travel abroad, it may be **mandatory** (as required by government authorities at the point(s) of departure and/or destination) to disclose and process your information for immigration, border control, security and anti-terrorism purposes, or any other purposes which they determine appropriate. Some countries will only permit travel if you provide your advance passenger data (for example Caricom API and US secure flight data). These requirements may differ depending on your destination and you are advised to check. Even if not mandatory, we may exercise our discretion to assist where appropriate.

  2. We may collect and process your information for the purposes set out below and in our registration with the Office of the Information Commissioner, and disclose the same to our group companies for business purposes and also to companies and our service providers who act as “data processors” on our behalf, or to credit and fraud agencies (some of whom are located outside the UK/EEA). These purposes include administration, service, quality and improvement-related activities, customer care, product innovation and choice, business management, operation and efficiencies, re-organisation/structuring/sale of our business (or group companies), risk assessment/management, security, fraud and crime prevention/detection, monitoring, research and analysis, social media, reviews, advertising and marketing, loyalty programmes, profiling customer purchasing preferences, activities and trends, dispute resolution/litigation, credit checking and debt collection.

  3. Information (such as health or religion) may be considered “sensitive personal data” under the Data Protection Act 1998. We collect it to provide you with our services, cater to your needs or act in your interest, and we are only prepared to accept sensitive personal data on the condition that we have your **positive consent**. By booking with us you also agree for your insurers, their agents and medical staff to exchange **relevant** information and sensitive personal data with us in circumstances where we/they need to act on your behalf or in the interest of passengers or in an emergency.  
 




_**If you do not agree to Our use of Your information above, we cannot engage/do business with you or accept your booking.**_

**Marketing material**

  1. Using your information, we may from time to time contact you with or make available to you (directly or indirectly) information on offers of goods and services, brochures, new products, forthcoming events or competitions from our holiday divisions and our group companies. We will tailor the information you receive or see; this will enable us to make available to you more personalised and relevant communications.  We may use innovative technologies and work with business partners to achieve this.
  2. We will assume you agree to email when you make an e-booking or provide us with your email in other situations such as in-store, competitions, promotions, prize draws and social media.
  3. If you do not wish to receive such information or would like to change your preference, please refer to point (2) of “Your Rights” below.



****Your rights****

  1. On completing our Data Subject Access Request form, you are entitled to a copy of the information we hold about you (for a £10 fee) and to correct any inaccuracies.
  2. You have the right to ask in writing not to receive direct marketing material from us. If available, you can amend your previous preference on our website(s), use our “unsubscribe email”, opt-out of personalised emails or refer to our literature containing instructions. Once properly notified by you, we will take steps to stop using your information in this way.
  3. For a list of relevant brands, please send us your request. Please write to Exodus Travels Limited, Legal Department, TUI Travel House House, Crawley Business Quarter, Fleming Way, Crawley, West Sussex RH10 9QL.



**Posting your images on our website**

  1. You have the option to upload your holiday images on to our website once you have opened a ‘My Exodus' account. Who sees your photos is determined by the settings you select in your ‘My Exodus' account. You may choose to send an email to your ‘Friends' including a link to your photo album(s) saved in you're ‘My Exodus' account. To enable this link to be forwarded to your friends you will need to supply an email address for your friend(s). Exodus will not use the friend's email address supplied for marketing purposes. When you choose to share your online images with Friends, those individuals will be able to view your album. Please note, as with any email, your friends could forward the email invitation to others, who will then be able to click on the link to the album within the email, and see the pictures too.
  2. You may choose to ‘Share your album with everyone' and thereby publish your album on the Exodus Website by assigning it a 3-character trip code. Your album will then be displayed in the Images section for that trip and will potentially be visible to anyone that visits the Website.
  3. Exodus employees or employees of partner companies that provide services to Exodus may see your photos even if they are not published on the Website as a result of carrying out maintenance on the Website or correcting problems with your account.

### Buying our products online

When you’re buying something on our website, we need to use cookies to keep track of what you’re booking as you move through each stage of the booking process.

Keeping track of your searches and preferences  
Your recent searches and shortlisted holidays are recorded using cookies.

If you’ve searched for a holiday, left our website and then you come back later, the search panel will keep the information you provided before, so you won’t need to fill everything in again.

If you’ve made a shortlist but you haven’t saved it by entering your email address, we’ll store your shortlisted holidays using a cookie, so you’ll be able to see it when you visit us again using the same computer or device.

Improving your experience  
We use cookies and software programmes to record, measure and analyse how our customers use our website. We use this information to understand what you want from our website, which helps us when we’re considering future products like flight routes and holidays.  
We can also find out how you move around our website, so we can look into any errors stopping you from being able to do what you want. The data we collect from cookies is really important for us to improve your experience.

Making your experience personal  
When you’re on our website, we might interact with you or show you personalised information and offers anonymously. Cookies help us to do this by letting us know how you’re using our website on your particular computer or device, which means we can work out what’s most relevant to you.

For example, we’ve got more than one million holidays available at any time, but we can use cookies to suggest things like holidays from your nearest airport, destinations you’ve shown interest in, or products you might like.
