PRIVACY POLICY
Last Updated: May 15, 2018
This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) describes how Exodus Movement, Inc. and its related
companies (“Exodus”) collect, use and share personal information of consumer users of this
website, https://www.exodus.io (the “Site”).
IMPORTANT INFORMATION
Exodus is committed to personal privacy. We do not need, or want, any information about the
identities of the people using our product in order to deliver our service. Except for the very
limited technical data collection mentioned below, which is essentially foundational to all
websites, the only information that we receive about individuals is what is voluntarily provided to
us in connection with inquiries, whether from people curious about Exodus or users of our
product seeking support. It comes down to this:
WE ONLY USE PERSONAL DATA TO PROVIDE REQUESTED SUPPORT OR RESPOND TO
INQUIRIES. WE NEVER COLLECT PERSONAL DATA ABOUT INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT
THEIR CONSENT.
WHAT WE COLLECT
As noted above, we are not interested in learning anything more about our users and visitors
than is absolutely necessary for us to provide information about our services, and support to
users of those services. We get information about you, which may include information that
allows us to identify an individual, natural person (such as an email address or phone number)
(collectively, “Personal Data”) in only the limited ways set forth below.
Information You Give Us.​ We collect only information you directly give us on our Site as via
email or other correspondence (chat, phone) as required to provide customer support.
Information Automatically Collected.​ We automatically log information about you and your
computer. For example, when visiting our Site, we log your computer operating system type,
browser type, browser language, the website you visited before browsing to our Site, pages you
viewed, how long you spent on a page, access times and information about your use of and
actions on our Site. When performing an exchange, we log information such as the wallet
addresses and the transaction IDs involved.
Do Not Track Signals.​ Some Internet browsers may be configured to send "Do Not Track" signals to the
online services that you visit. We currently do not respond to do not track signals. To find out more about
"Do Not Track," please visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.

provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site.
We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your
