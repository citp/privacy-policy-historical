This site may use cookies to help you personalize your online experience.

A web beacon is a transparent image file used to monitor your journey around a single website or collection of sites.

This site may serve third party advertisements that use cookies and web beacons in the course of ads being served on the web site to ascertain how many times you've seen an advertisement. No personally identifiable information you give us is provided to them for cookie or web beacon use, so they cannot personally identify you with that information on this web site.

 **Release of Information**

If exercise4weightloss.com is sold, the information I have obtained from you through your voluntary participation in this site may transfer to the new owner as a part of the sale in order that the service being provided to you may continue.
