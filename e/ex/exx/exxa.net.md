The Privacy Policy describes how Company uses and protects the information that you give while using the Platforms and intends to provide visitors and registered users of the Company’s Platforms (“You” or “Your”) with clear and complete information about the data and information that collected and the way that data and information is stored and used. The Company values the privacy of its users. Your privacy is important to us.

For avoidance of doubt, this Privacy Policy forms a part of the Company’s Website & App Terms of Use (EXXA – Terms of Use). In the event of any conflict between this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use, the Privacy Policy will prevail in relation to the usage of Your Personal Data, as defined below. All defined terms in the Terms of Use shall apply to this Privacy Policy unless specifically stated.

I. INFORMATION COLLECTED:

The Company shall not collect, use or disclose Your personal information unless You give consent to us for the collection, use or disclosure of Your personal information. The Company promises to only collect and use personal information as mentioned below:

 Your personal information which identifies You, including Your birth date, IP address, login information, browser details and settings and details regarding Your operating system;

 contact information such as e-mail addresses and telephone numbers;

 information on how you purchase and use the company’s software and services; and

 Your Payment related information including Your bank account number and Your credit or debit card details.  
The items so collected shall constitute “Personal Data”, which is defined under the Personal Data Protection Act of Singapore (the “PDPA”) to mean any data, whether true or not, about an individual who can be identified from that data or from that data and other information to which an organisation has or is likely to have access. Personal Data collected by the Company shall be subject to complete protection by the Company in accordance with applicable law.

The Company collects Personal Data in two ways. The first is when You provide us with information while using the Platforms, including filling out forms or contacting the Company using the given contact details. The second is when You browse the Platforms, where technical non-identifiable data is collected.

You should ensure that all Personal Data that You submit to us is complete, accurate, true and correct. Failure on Your part to submit this information accurately may result in our inability to provide You with the best possible experience while using our Platforms and any of our products.

III. INFORMATION PROTECTION:

The Company will protect Your Personal Data in strict accordance with applicable laws, including in accordance with the provisions of the PDPA. Nevertheless, You acknowledge and agree that communications through the Internet are not entirely secure and that any information transferred to the Company is done so at Your own risk. The Company does not warrant or guarantee that the information You provide will not be accessed, copied, used, or disposed of in breach of its security measures, and You agree not to hold us liable or responsible for any loss or damage resulting therefrom.

Unless required by law or a Court order or direction, or unless as relevant for the purpose stated:

 The Company will not sell, share or trade Your Personal Data collected online with third parties, except unless strictly necessary to complete a payment or under a direction by a court of law or judicial authority; and

 Personal Data collected online will be for internal Company use only, and will be viewed by Company employees on a strict need to know basis only.

By accepting these conditions, and by continuing to use the Platforms, You agree and accept that all information provided by You will be true and will be kept up to date during Your continuing use of the Platforms.

IV. USER UNDERTAKING:
