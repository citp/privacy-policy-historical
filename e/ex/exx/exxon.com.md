Exxon Mobil Corporation and its affiliated companies, ("ExxonMobil") appreciate your interest in this Web site and other related or linked ExxonMobil sites (Site). Your privacy is important and we want you to understand our practices with respect to gathering information from visitors to the Site and with respect to the uses we make of that information. Please check each portion or page of the Site that you visit. Certain portions or pages of the Site may contain changes to the Privacy Statement applicable to your use of that portion or page, for example, certain applications may request additional information from you.  

### Information and Uses

When someone visits the Site, our web servers automatically gather information that allows the site to communicate with the visitor's computer during the visit. We also track such information as the number of visits to the site, which parts of the site visitors select, analytics to measure and observe user behavior, IP address (the Internet address assigned to your device from your Internet Service Provider), device type, domain type, browser type (e.g., Firefox, Chrome or Internet Explorer), date and time of day, device screen size. We use such information for purposes including helping us design and administer the Site.

Privacy concerns focus on Personal Information, that is, information that could identify a specific individual such as names, addresses, e-mail addresses, and telephone numbers. If during your visit you personalize the Site, complete an order form, enter a contest, provide survey feedback or submit other information to us, you may provide us with Personal Information. We may collect and use that Personal Information to process your survey feedback for the purpose of improving your experience at our branded sites, to provide you with products or services, to bill you for products and services you request, or to tell you about ExxonMobil products and services which we think may be of interest to you—including via email and text message, to communicate with you for other purposes. We may also use that Personal Information as necessary to protect our rights and the rights of others, including by enforcing our Terms & Conditions, and for any other purpose disclosed to you at the time we collect your information or pursuant to your consent.

As a visitor to our Site, you may be asked to allow us to access geolocation information about your computer or mobile device.  This geolocation information will be used for purposes including to provide the services you request such as showing the location of nearby service stations, and the route to service stations. We may also use this geolocation information to tell you about ExxonMobil products and services, for instance in combination with weather information about the geolocation of your computer or mobile device. If you do not wish for us to use the geolocation information for such purposes, you can decline our request to access the geolocation information.  In that case, some of the services of our Site may not be delivered. We may provide the geolocation information to third parties that assist us in the provision of the services and communications to you through the Site.

As explained below in the section on Dissemination of Information to Third Parties, we do not distribute or sell Personal Information to third parties for the purpose of allowing them to market their products and services to you; moreover, as explained in the Opt Out/Modify Information section, we will make a reasonable effort to remove your Personal Information from our database in such a way that you will not receive future communications from us, if that is your wish. If you notify us that Personal Information previously submitted to our site is no longer accurate, we will make a reasonable effort to make appropriate corrections. To facilitate our efforts to meet your request, it would be helpful if you could let us know the context in which you provided Personal Information, e.g. in connection with promotion of a specific product or service.

### Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Technologies

Our Services may use online technologies called “cookies” and “web beacons,” as well as other local storage technologies.  This section explains what these technologies are and how they may be used.

_Cookies and Other Local Storage Technologies_

Generally speaking, “cookies” are text files that are placed in your device’s browser, and that can be used to help recognize your browser across different web pages, websites, and browsing sessions.  Your browser or device may offer settings related to cookies.  For example, you may be able to configure your browser not to accept cookies or to notify you when a cookie is being sent.  For more information about whether these settings are available, what they do, and how they work, visit your browser or device’s help material.  If you decide not to accept cookies from us, you may not be able to take advantage of all of the features of the Services.

Cookies are stored on your device or in “local storage.” We also use other types of local storage technologies, such as Local Shared Objects (sometimes called “Flash cookies”), in connection with our Services.  These technologies are similar to cookies in that they are stored on your device and can be used to maintain information about your activities and preferences.

However, these other local storage technologies may use parts of your device other than your browser, which means you may not be able to control their use using the browser tools and settings you use to control browser cookies.  For more information about managing Flash cookies, please visit the Adobe Flash Player website.  Your browser’s privacy controls may enable you to manage other types of local storage.

Our Services may use cookies or other local storage technologies in combination with other information about you to enhance and personalize your experience on our Services (or elsewhere online), including:

  * to help authenticate you when you use our Services;
  * to remember your preferences and registration information; to enable a shopping cart;
  * to present and help measure and research the effectiveness of our Service, advertisements, and email communications (by determining which emails you open and act upon); and
  * to customize the content and advertisements provided to you through our Services and on other websites and services you visit.



_Web Beacons_

Web beacons are small pieces of code placed on Web pages, videos, and in emails that can communicate information about your browser and device to a server.  Beacons can be used, among other things, to count the users who visit a Web page or read an email, or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a user viewing a Web page or email.
