# Privacy Policy | Ex Libris

This is the privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) that governs how we, Ex Libris, use personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that we receive and store about individuals, such as visitors to the Website (defined below), library staff, students, patrons, and other library users (each a “User” and collectively the “Users”), who use (i) the website www.exlibrisgroup.com, and other websites operated by Ex Libris (collectively the “Website”) and/or (ii) Ex Libris products and services that we offer (“Products and Services”).

We have implemented this Privacy Policy because User privacy is important to us. We are committed to respecting Users’ privacy and we recognize Users’ need for appropriate protection and management of any Personal Information that we receive and store.

## Personal Information

“Personal Information” means any information that may be used to identify a User, including, but not limited to, a User’s first and last name, personal profile, home or other physical address, email address or other contact information. It also includes information regarding patron registration, fines and circulation records. Ex Libris at all times treats such Personal Information as confidential and subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

### What Personal Information We Collect and How We Collect It

#### The Website

We do not require Website visitors to provide Personal Information in order to have access to information available on the Website. We may collect Personal Information that Users choose to provide when filling out registration forms on the Website for different Ex Libris offerings and services, such as events, webinars or ‘contact us’ requests (collectively, “Contact Us Requests”).

#### Products and Services

We may receive and store Personal Information about Users from our library customers in connection with the Products and Services that we provide.

#### The Way We Use Personal Information

We may contact Users to respond to their Contact Us Requests, or contact library staff in connection with their use of Products and Services to which their institutions subscribe. We store Personal Information only for as long as necessary to respond to Users, to provide the Products and Services and/or to comply with applicable record retention rules.

We will not use Personal Information to contact patrons of library customers. We will not share, transfer or disclose Users’ Personal Information to any third party without each User’s express consent, except as expressly stated herein.

#### Sharing Personal Information

We may share or transfer Personal Information (i) as directed by our library customers, to whom Users originally disclosed their Personal Information; and (ii) as may be required by law.

We may also share or transfer Personal Information (i) within the Ex Libris group of companies, but only for the uses described in this Privacy Policy, such as responding to Users; and/or (ii) to third party service providers solely for hosted storage purposes. If we transfer Personal Information to our affiliates, we will do so only if they are first bound by terms at least as restrictive as this Privacy Policy.

#### User rights regarding Personal Information

As required by law, we provide Users with the right to access, correct, or delete any of their Personal Information that we may be holding. Any such request should be forwarded to our Privacy Officer (the details are provided below). We may request that Users first attempt to resolve their concern (and show proof thereof) with the library that collected the Personal Information and provided it to us for storage purposes and in connection with the Products and Services.

Any User wishing to exercise their privacy rights, to obtain additional information, or to make a comment or complaint regarding this Privacy Policy or its implementation, is invited to contact our Privacy Officer at privacy@exlibrisgroup.com.

### Children’s Privacy

The Website, and the Products and Services, are not structured to attract children under the age of 18. Accordingly, we do not intend to collect Personal Information from anyone we know to be under 18 years of age.

### In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy

In the event that we are acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign Personal Information as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.

### Security

The security of Personal Information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards, including the use of appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards, to protect the Personal Information submitted to us.

### Enforcement/Verification

We will conduct compliance audits of our relevant privacy practices to verify adherence to this Policy. Where we have knowledge that any of our employees or third party service providers is using or disclosing personal information in a manner contrary to this policy, we will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop the use or disclosure. We hold our employees and third party providers accountable for maintaining the trust that our Users place in our company.

### Updates

We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions from this Privacy Policy at any time. Any such changes will be posted on our website at www.exlibrisgroup.com.
