   What is your credit card fraud policy?

In the unlikely event that you experience unauthorized use of your credit card, promptly report the fraudulent activity to your credit card company.

   What is SSL and how does it help protect my privacy?  
| 

We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology for mutual authentication, data encryption and data integrity- all to help ensure secure transactions for our customers. SSL is the industry standard security protocol to encode sensitive information, such as your credit card number. SSL creates a shared digital key, which only lets the sender and the receiver of the transmission scramble or unscramble information. To everyone else, even the servers relaying the message, the SSL transmission is indecipherable. SSL encryption can only be broken by intercepting the encrypted message, recording it, and using a computer to try every possible combination until the key is cracked. Most keys range from 40 to 1,024 digits long...as you can imagine, the number of possible combinations can be into the billions and beyond! SSL deals with data encryption during transmission, not storage.  
  
|    
   Ok, so how about encryption?  
| 

Encryption is based on the mathematical scrambling and unscrambling of messages. The type of encryption we use assigns two keys - one is a public key and one is a private key. When you send us a message, you use our public key to encrypt your message. Once we receive your encrypted message, we use the private key to decode it. The same key cannot both encrypt and decrypt information. So, information encrypted using the private key can only be decrypted using the public key, and vice versa- ensuring the security of your information.   
  
|    
   
   I've heard a lot about Secure Sites. What does that mean?  
| 

Before completing any transaction on a website, you should make sure it is a Secure Site. Being on a Secure Site means you are connected under the cloak of SSL security. You can tell if you are on a Secure Site if you see a padlock or key somewhere along the bottom of your browser's window. If the lock is closed or if the key is unbroken, you are dealing with a Secure Site.

   What are cookies and how do they affect my privacy?  
| 

Simply put, a "cookie" is a small file that serves as an identifier stored on your machine. Although they are not required to browse our site, we use cookies to make web shopping possible. For instance, when you are ready to purchase an item, a cookie allows our site to "remember" you have added the item to your shopping cart. eFaucets.com contracts with third party service partners to provide us with data collection, storage and reporting services. Under no circumstances are these partners permitted to use your information in any manner, other than to help us make our site more useful and efficient for our visitors. Service partners are required to sign confidentiality agreements and will abide by eFaucets.com privacy policies.  
  
|    
   
   What if I still do not feel my online transaction is secure?  
| 

We will be happy to assist you with your purchase over the phone at 1-800-891-0896
