<h1>Tax Information Privacy and Security</h1>

<p class="h1">EFILE LLC (herinafter refered to as "EFILE") is committed to keeping your information private and recognizing the importance customers place on the privacy and confidentiality of their information. While  new technologies allow us to more efficiently serve our clients, we are  committed to maintaining the rigorous privacy standards that are synonymous  with our established and trusted name.</p>
<p class="h1">We provide our Privacy Policy to explain our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is colleced and used. Our Privacy Policy is available throughout the website, as well as on our tax screens within the tax program.</p>
<p class="h1">EFILE adheres to Federal and State regulations to ensure the security and confidentiality of personal information you share with us during your tax preparation and efile process. We are committed to respecting and protecting  your online privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and  management of any personally identifiable or tax related information you share  with us. &nbsp;Your tax return information  will be treated with extreme care and confidentiality. EFILE strives to comply  with all applicable U.S.  tax laws to protect your privacy. Our goal is to provide protection for your  personal information no matter where that personal information is collected,  transferred, or retained. </p>
<p class="h1">EFILE  partners with third parties to provide tax and financial services. When users sign up for these particular services, users are requested to accept third party user agreements. If necessary, EFILE shares names or other information required by third parties to provide these services.  These third parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information  except for the purpose of providing these services. </p>

<h2>Covered  Web Sites </h2>
<p class="h2">The  Privacy Policy described herein is applicable to this entire web site,  including all areas where financial information is gathered and income tax data  is input, printed, and/or transmitted. It does not apply to any other online  services, or to any other web sites published and/or maintained by us.</p>
<p class="h2">This  Privacy Policy covers all the online information practices of www.efile.com.  Other sites maintained by EFILE operate under their own Privacy and security  policies. Third party web sites operate under their own Privacy and security  policies.</p>

<p><a href="#top">top</a> <img src="../efile-images/topArrow.gif"></p>

	<h2>Our  Commitment to Data Security</h2>
<p class="h2">To  prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use  of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and  managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect  online.</p>
<h2>Internal  Controls</h2>
<p class="h2">When  collecting, storing, and retrieving your personal data, extensive internal  controls are maintained throughout the process to ensure security and  confidentiality.</p>
<p class="h2">Our  Internet-based systems are protected behind firewalls, and all mission critical  servers are deployed in a cluster environment to provide an even greater level  of security and protection against system failure. All data is maintained and  backed-up on a regular schedule to provide adequate redundancy and ensure that  the integrity of information is never jeopardized.</p>
<p class="h2">Some of  our pages utilize "cookies" and other tracking technologies. A "cookie"  is a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect information  about web site activity. Some cookies and other technologies may serve to  recall personal information previously indicated by a web user. Most browsers  allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how  to remove them. </p>
<p class="h2">You may  set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to  block cookies with your browser, but please note that if you choose to erase or  block your cookies, you will need to re-enter your original user ID and  password to gain access to certain parts of the web site. </p>
<p class="h2">Tracking  technologies may record information such as Internet domain and host names;  Internet protocol (IP) addresses; browser software and operating system types;  clickstream patterns; and dates and times that our site is accessed. Our use of  cookies and other tracking technologies allows us to improve our web site and  your web experience. We may also analyze information that does not contain  personal information for trends and statistics. </p>
<p class="h2">Our  employees are subject to strict guidelines regarding confidentiality, and  internal access to customer data is restricted to highly trained personnel on  an "as-needed" basis.</p>
<h2>Transmitting  Information</h2>
<p class="h2">When  transmitting information between you and our server, as well as when  communicating with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for electronic filing,  data security is handled through a protocol called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).  SSL is an established and mature Internet security standard with two dominant  features: web server authentication and data encryption.</p>
<p><a href="#top">top</a> <img src="../efile-images/topArrow.gif"></p>
<h2>Data  Encryption</h2>
<p class="h2">Data  encryption is the process of transforming legible information into a complex  arrangement of illegible information. SSL uses a private/public key combination  to encrypt data when it is sent and to decrypt data when it is received. SSL  encrypts data using a mathematical formula, also referred to as a  "key."</p>
<p class="h2">Encryption  strength is measured by the length of the key used to encrypt the data; the  longer the key, the more effective the encryption. Using the SSL protocol, data  transmission between you and our web server is performed at a standard level of  encryption strength.</p>
<h2>Web  Server Authentication</h2>
<p class="h2">An SSL  certificate is issued to ensure authentic and accurate identification of a  secured web server. This translates into a digital ID, an electronic  fingerprint, which is included in the key used to encrypt the data. Only our  web server, in this case, is able to decrypt the data that you transmit because  it is the intended (and digitally certified) secured web server for this data  transmission.</p>
<h2>The  Information We Collect</h2>
<p class="h2">This  Policy applies to all information collected or submitted on our web site. If a  credit card is used to pay for the Service, in addition to tax return  information, we collect the following credit card and personal information:</p>
<ul class="ulh2">
<li>Cardholder's  Name</li>
<li>Credit  Card Type</li>
<li>Credit  Card Number</li>
<li>Expiration  Date</li>
<li>Cardholder's  Billing Address</li>
<li>Daytime  Phone Number</li>
<li>E-mail Address</li>
<li>Employer's  or Relative's Phone Number</li>
</ul>
<p class="h2">The  credit card information is used to process your transaction. This information  is not made available to anyone else. </p>
<p class="h2">We also  collect the following information for use in answering your inquiries for  technical support when you submit an email requesting our assistance: </p>
<ul class="ulh2">
<li>Your name</li>
<li>User ID</li>
<li>E-mail Address</li>
<li>Phone Number</li>
<li>Operating  System</li>
<li>Browser Type</li>
<li>Connection type/speed</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">top</a> <img src="../efile-images/topArrow.gif"></p>
<h2>The Way  We Use Information</h2>
<p class="h2">The tax  return information that we collect is used strictly for lawful purposes and is  never shared with federal, state, or other taxing authorities without your  consent. The foregoing notwithstanding, we reserve the right to disclose your  information without your consent in response to a court order, subpoena, search  warrant, or other inquiry or request from governmental or regulatory  authorities, or to protect against fraud or other criminal activities. If you  choose to electronically file your return, we will transmit your tax return to  the appropriate federal and state taxing authorities.</p>
<p class="h2">The IRS  requires us to provide the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer from  which the return originated, as well as the e-mail address of the person who  electronically filed the return. This information is sent to the IRS at the  time you choose to submit your return to the IRS for electronic filing.</p>
<p class="h2">In order  to electronically file your return, we must share your submitted tax  information with the appropriate tax authorities in order to complete your  request. You can control whether or not you wish your tax information shared  for this purpose by deciding whether or not to complete the tax returns forms,  which are all clearly labeled.</p>
<p class="h2">The above  listed credit card information that we collect will be used strictly for order  processing and billing purposes, and will not be shared with any other party.  When appropriate, bank account or credit card information is also passed to our bank for processing purposes. You will enter this information during the routine course of a  purchase. In the event that our internet service staff should need to research  and resolve any status or billing issues associated with an order, the  information will only be accessed by authorized personnel.</p>
<p class="h2">Our Basic  Service entitles you to notification via e-mail of filing deadlines, estimate  reminders, tax law changes, as well as tax planning and financial information  that may affect your tax return. In order for us to provide you with the Basic  Service, it is required that you provide us with your e-mail address and  consent to our limited review of your tax return information with our  proprietary software program to determine whether your tax return information  would trigger such notifications.</p>
