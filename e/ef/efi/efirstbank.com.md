# FirstBank Privacy Policy and Disclosure

FirstBank is committed to maintaining the privacy of our customers. We have policies and procedures in place to restrict access to your nonpublic personal information to employees that need to know that information in order to provide products or services to you. We train our employees to protect the confidentiality of your records. In addition, we maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your nonpublic personal information. 

We have implemented commercially reasonable security procedures for our Internet Banking Service. More information about the security procedures for the Internet Banking Service is available [here](http://www.efirstbank.com/internetbanking/security.html). 

In regard to Internet usage, cookies are pieces of data assigned by a Web server to the browser on a specific PC. Cookies help web sites recognize return visitors, and cannot be read by a web site other than the one that set the cookie. When someone returns to a web site he or she has visited before, the person's browser gives this data back to the server. 

FirstBank uses cookies to track web site usage, such as the number of visitors to our web site and the pages visited, in order to evaluate the usefulness and effectiveness of our site. FirstBank also uses cookies to maintain the continuity of your visit to our product applications and Internet Banking Service. We do not store user id's, passwords, or any personal information in cookies.

In addition, we cannot guarantee how these third parties use cookies or whether they place or add computer cookies that may identify visitors personally. We recommend and encourage users to review Privacy Policies carefully before providing personal information on any of these web sites.

We have implemented commercially reasonable security systems to protect personal information that we receive from any of our online applications. All information that is sent to us on these applications is encrypted using the standard security protocol Secure Socket Layer (SSL) during the transmission from an applicant's personal computer.

For Internet Banking enrollment, once the customer has been enrolled for Internet Banking, he or she may view and update certain user information by logging into Internet Banking and going to the Other Services section. Customers may also call an Internet Banking Representative at 303-232-5522 or 1-800-964-3444 outside Metro Denver.

While visitors can use e-mail to contact us about routine issues and inquiries, e-mail may not be a secure method of communication for time sensitive communication or communication of information that is confidential. We strongly recommend that this type of information not be communicated via e-mail.
