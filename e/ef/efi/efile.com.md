While new technologies allow us to more efficiently serve our clients, we are committed to maintaining the rigorous privacy standards that are synonymous with our established and trusted name.

eFile adheres to applicable law to ensure the security and confidentiality of personal information you share with us. 

## Covered Web Sites

This Policy is applicable to this entire web site, including all areas where financial information is gathered and income tax data is input, printed, and/or transmitted. It does not apply to any other online services, or to any other web sites published and/or maintained by eFile.

This Privacy Policy covers all the online information practices of www.efile.com. Other sites maintained by eFile may operate under their own Privacy and security policies. Third party web sites operate under their own Privacy and security policies.

## Internal Controls

When collecting, storing, and retrieving your personal data, extensive internal controls are maintained throughout the process to ensure security and confidentiality.

Our Internet-based systems are protected behind firewalls, and all mission critical servers are deployed in a cluster environment to provide an even greater level of security and protection against system failure. All data is maintained and backed-up on a regular schedule to provide adequate redundancy and ensure that the integrity of information is never jeopardized.

Some of our pages utilize "cookies" and other tracking technologies. A "cookie" is a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect information about web site activity. Some cookies and other technologies may serve to recall personal information previously indicated by a web user. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.

You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but please note that if you choose to erase or block your cookies, you will need to re-enter your original user ID and password to gain access to certain parts of the web site.

Tracking technologies may record information such as Internet domain and host names; Internet protocol (IP) addresses; browser software and operating system types; clickstream patterns; and dates and times that our site is accessed. Our use of cookies and other tracking technologies allows us to improve our web site and your web experience. We may also analyze information that does not contain personal information for trends and statistics.

Our employees are subject to strict guidelines regarding confidentiality, and internal access to customer data is restricted to highly trained personnel on an "as-needed" basis.

## Transmitting Information

When transmitting information between you and our server, as well as when communicating with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for electronic filing, data security is handled through a protocol called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). SSL is an established and mature Internet security standard with two dominant features: data encryption and web server authentication.

## Data Encryption

Data encryption is the process of transforming legible information into a complex arrangement of illegible information. SSL uses a private/public key combination to encrypt data when it is sent and to decrypt data when it is received. SSL encrypts data using a mathematical formula, also referred to as a “key.”

Encryption strength is measured by the length of the key used to encrypt the data; the longer the key, the more effective the encryption. Using the SSL protocol, data transmission between you and our web server is performed at a standard level of encryption strength.

## Web Server Authentication

An SSL certificate is issued to ensure authentic and accurate identification of a secured web server. This translates into a digital ID, an electronic fingerprint, which is included in the key used to encrypt the data. Only our web server, in this case, is able to decrypt the data that you transmit because it is the intended (and digitally certified) secured web server for the applicable data transmission.

## The Way We Use Information

In the normal course of business, and subject to the limitations explained below, your tax return information is used solely for the purpose of allowing you to complete and file your tax return.  The tax return information that we collect is not generally shared with federal, state, or other taxing authorities without your consent. The foregoing notwithstanding, if you choose to electronically file your return, we will transmit your tax return to the appropriate federal and state taxing authorities. The IRS requires us to provide the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer from which the return originated, as well as the e-mail address of the person who electronically filed the return. This information is sent to the IRS at the time you choose to submit your return to the IRS for electronic filing.

In order to electronically file your return, we must share your submitted tax information with the appropriate tax authorities in order to complete your request. You can control whether or not you wish your tax information shared for this purpose by deciding whether or not to complete the tax returns forms, which are all clearly labeled.

Credit card information provided to eFile is handled consistent with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).

Our Basic Service entitles you to notification via e-mail of filing deadlines, estimate reminders, and tax law changes, as well as tax planning and financial information that may affect your tax return. In order for us to provide you with the Basic Service, it is required that you provide us with your e-mail address and consent to our limited review of your tax return information with our proprietary software program to determine whether your tax return information would trigger such notifications.

In addition to our Basic Service, we may send to you, via your e-mail address, information and promotional messages about other products and services that we think may be of interest to you. Any sharing of such information is subject to the opt-out option as discussed in the paragraph below.

In addition, we may provide you with promotional messages. You will have the option to opt-out of receiving such promotional messages. Declining to receive e-mail promotional messages will not affect our ability to deliver our Basic Service to you.
