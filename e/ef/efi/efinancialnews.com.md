### 4\. USE OF COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING DEVICES

We use cookies and other tracking technologies (including pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology) to improve and personalise the Financial News Services and for the other purposes explained in this Privacy and Cookies Policy. A cookie is comprised of small bits of data that often include an anonymous unique identifier. Websites send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so the website can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that site.

We may use cookies to

  * facilitate our login processes;
  * identify returning users, registrants, and subscribers and to allow them to be presented with a personalised version of the Financial News Services; 
  * enable you to move more easily around our sites, and to display relevant content, products, services and advertising, as described further below;
  * track your use of our sites to better develop our sites in accordance with your requirements; 
  * collect and store information about your usage of our Financial News Services and your browsing pattern across sites, such as pages you have visited, search queries you have run, and advertisements you have seen, in order to make advertisements available to you that are more relevant to your interests.



We may also use cookies and similar tools to relate your use of our Financial News Services to personal information obtained from you or a reputable third party. For example, if you have asked us to provide you with information about our upcoming products or promotions, cookie and/or clickstream data about your activities on our Financial News Services may allow us to limit the materials we provide to you to items we think you will find interesting based on your prior online activities and preferences. You can delete cookies from your hard drive at any time, however this will mean that any settings such as your stored username and password will have to be reset. You can set your internet browser so that it will not allow cookies to be stored on your computer. This may reduce functionality of the site, prevent access to registration/subscription-only areas of the site and mean that certain features or content will not be available to you. Further information on how to prevent cookies from being stored on your computer can be found on [http://www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/) under the "manage cookies" section. Alternatively go to the help menu within your internet browser.

Users can manage the use of Flash technologies, including cookies, with the Flash management tools available on Adobe’s website, see <http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security/privacy_policy/faq.html>. Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features or personalisation available through our Financial News Services.

From time to time we may permit third party companies to set cookies on our sites for purposes which may include market research, serving advertisements, revenue tracking, to improve functionality of the site or monitoring compliance with our subscription agreement.

Financial News Services employs analytics services supported by third party companies such as Google, Adobe Omniture, and AudienceScience Inc. These third parties generate cookies for statistical purposes on our behalf, for example, for tracking how many unique users have seen a particular feature or advertisement, and how many times they have seen it. We do not have access to these cookies, although we may use statistical information arising from the cookies provided by these third parties for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Financial News Services, compiling reports on website activity and providing other services relating to website activity and browsing patterns across the Financial News Services and third party websites. These third parties have their own privacy policies and the information generated by the cookie about your use of our sites may be transmitted to and stored on servers in Ireland and the United States. They may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on their behalf.

If you wish to refuse the use of cookies by Google, please visit <http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout>.

If you wish to refuse the use of cookies by Adobe Omniture, please visit <http://www.omniture.com/privacy/2o7>.

If you wish to refuse the use of cookies by AudienceScience, please visit <http://www.audiencescience.com/privacy>.

Some of the advertisements you see on Financial News Services are generated by third party service providers and advertisers. Some of these third parties generate cookies for statistical purposes on our behalf, for example, for tracking how many unique users have seen a particular advertisement, and how many times they have seen it, and for providing advertisements that are more relevant to users. They do not contain identifying information such as your name or email address. This profile enables us to deliver more relevant advertising on our Financial News Services. For example if on a previous visit you went to our personal finance pages, we might find this out from your cookie, and we may then target personal finance advertisements on your subsequent visits to our websites which we think may be of interest to you.

To find out more about third party online advertising and to opt out of this type of advertising, visit [www.youronlinechoices.co.uk](http://www.youronlinechoices.co.uk/) or [www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/). Please remember that if you opt out of this type of advertising, you will still receive advertising when you are using the website, however, that advertising will not be tailored for you.

Financial News Services may use pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These GIF files may be provided by one of our Ad Management Partners, namely DoubleClick, Pointroll, Atlas, or MediaMind/Eyeblaster. These files enable our Ad Management Partners to recognise a unique cookie on your browser which in turn enables us to determine general geographic location, track how many unique users have seen a particular advertisement, and to re-target ads. For more information about Google DoubleClick, including information about their Dart for Advertisers (DFA) technology and how to opt-out, go to <http://www.google.com/doubleclick>.

### 6\. NOTICE

**Means of Notice and Choice.** This Privacy and Cookies Policy summarises our collection and use of your information. If we ask for specific personal information that will be used in a manner different from what is described in this Privacy and Cookies Policy, we will inform you at the time of collection.

**Cross-Border Transfer.** The information collected through the Financial News Services may be stored and processed in the United States and other countries where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers, and you consent to the transfer of information to the United States and other countries which may have different data protection rules than the country of your residence.

**Data Retention.** We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy and Cookies Policy unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law.

**Linked Websites.** Our Financial News Services may also be linked to sites operated by Financial News affiliates (i.e., that are part of Dow Jones & Company, Inc. and the News America Group, collectively, "Affiliated Companies") or third parties, and may carry advertisements or offer content, functionality, games, or applications developed and maintained by third parties.

Some of these third party sites may be co-branded with a Financial News logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by us. Financial News is not responsible for the privacy practices of any such third parties, and once you leave our Financial News Services via a link, enable a third party service, or click on an advertisement, you should then check the applicable privacy policy of the third-party site. Additionally, although all Affiliated Companies adhere to the News Corporation corporate [Privacy Principles](http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html), users who visit an Affiliated Company site should still refer to its separate privacy policy, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy and Cookies Policy.
