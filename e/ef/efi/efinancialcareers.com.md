### Privacy Policy

Last Updated: September 2009

PRIVACY POLICY/YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS

eFinancialCareers is committed to safeguarding the privacy of our users while providing personalized career management services.

Note: Any reference to 'we' or 'us', 'our' or website are references to the website www.eFinancialCareers.com (the “Website”), (the eFinancialCareers network of career sites), and all of our partner career centers. eFinancialCareers provides links to the websites of many other companies to which this policy does not apply. We cannot, and do not, assume responsibility for the privacy or information policies, practices or actions of any third parties.

This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes how we treat personal information we collect from visitors to the Website, how we use the personal information that we have collected, and the ways you can access and correct your personal information.

Dice Holdings, Inc. (the parent company eFinancialCareers) is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent organization whose mission is to build user’s trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. Because this Website wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact [privacy@efinancialcareers.com](mailto:privacy@efinancialcareers.com). If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should contact TRUSTe at <http://watchdog.truste.com/pvr.php?page=complaint>. TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with us to resolve your concerns.

Dice Holdings, Inc. complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union and Switzerland, respectively.

**Summary**

In general, we gather information about all of our users in relation to general site usage and use that data in aggregate form only. We may share that aggregate information with partners and clients in order to demonstrate eFinancialCareers and enable them to improve their use of the service.

We use the personal information that we collect from you to process your registration, provide personal career management tools (such as job search agents, résumé databases), identify personal preferences and match your needs with relevant products and services.

**Personal Information Collected**

We respect your personal information and undertake to comply with applicable federal, state and local legislation from time to time in place.

When you register with the Website, you will be asked to provide us with certain personal information. We collect personal information such as name and email during registration. Additionally, we collect demographic information that you supply when you upload your resume and insert details, such as your address, work experience, location, and education background. We do not disclose information about your individual visits to the Website or personal information that you provide without your permission except when we believe the law requires it or as expressly provided below. However we may disclose to our partners and third parties, on an anonymous basis, certain aggregate information contained in your personal information.

**Communications from the Website**

We reserve the right to send you email communications offering third party services and products to you based on the preferences that you identify in your registration and at any time thereafter; such offers may be made by us or by our partners via us. You may change your preferences from receiving promotional communications from us and other companies at any time by logging into “My eFC” portal and changing your preferences under “ My Newsletter” , or by emailing [privacy@efinancialcareers.com](mailto:privacy@efinancialcareers.com).

**Consent**

You signify your consent to us collecting and using this information by your registration on this Website. Should for any reason we elect to make a material change to our Policy, we will notify you of those changes here in our Privacy Policy, by email or by notice on our Website if identifiable personal data is involved so that you may make an informed decision and keep your preferences up to date. In addition, your data may sometimes also be used by us to inform you about new services on or functionality changes to our Website. If you do not wish to receive this information, please send an e-mail to [privacy@efinancialcareers.com](mailto:privacy@efinancialcareers.com).

1\. Certain eFinancialCareers services require registration or login prior to access, this is to help maintain the confidentiality of your personal information.

2\. We will collect information about your tastes and preferences both when you tell us what these are and by analysis of customer traffic, including by using cookies and other technologies (see below).

3\. If you enter a contest or promotion we will ask for your name, address and e-mail address. This is so we can administer the contest and inform the winners. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.

4\. We use information collected about you to personalize your visits to our Website and recommend goods or services to you. We also use the information to help us develop the design and layout of our Website to improve our sites to that they are as useful and enjoyable as possible.

5\. Sometimes we might use the information to let you know about new services on or functionality changes to our Website. If you do not wish to receive this information, please send an e-mail to [privacy@efinancialcareers.com](mailto:privacy@efinancialcareers.com).

6\. Résumés. The eFinancialCareers confidential résumé database enables you to anonymously and confidentially profile your skills and experience to recruiters.

When activated your résumé is viewable by recruiters but, if you so designate, remains anonymous; if you so designate, your name and contact information remain confidential and their release remains in your control at all times. If a recruiter wishes to contact you they do so by sending an email to eFinancialCareers quoting the number of your résumé and details of their opportunity, this email is subsequently forwarded to you.

It is your decision as to whether you respond to the opportunity or not. If you choose to do so you will contact the recruiter directly, eFinancialCareers does not contact recruiters on your behalf (unless, on each occasion, you expressly authorize us to do so) nor do we recommend or give an opinion to any party as to the suitability of the job opportunity, you, the recruiter or employer.

We try to restrict the ability of persons other than bona-fide clients, such as recruiters, hiring managers, consultants and HR professionals, to contact individuals in the résumé database. However, we are not responsible if some other third party posing as a bona-fide recruiter becomes a client, gains access to the résumé database and subsequently contacts you. You may remove your résumé(s) from our database at any time. However you should note that current or former clients of eFinancialCareers may have retained a copy of your anonymous résumé in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use or privacy of this résumé in these circumstances.PII may also be used by:

1\. Our customer support team to help users with any problems that they are having using their account. It is possible for our staff to pull up PII data to assist them in carrying out CRM duties. 

2\. By our marketing team for the segmentation of our userbase and targeting of promotion emails or any other emails which they opt in to receive 

3\. By our product team to keep them informed of any significant changes to the site.

**Will we disclose the information we collect to third parties?**

We do not disclose information about your individual visits to the Website or personal information that you provide, such as your name, address, email address, telephone number etc. except when we believe the law requires it. 

However, in the event eFinancialCareers goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via Websiteemail of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.

We also may disclose to our partners and third parties, on an anonymous basis, certain aggregate information contained in your personal information.

eFinancialCareers reserves the right to access and disclose individually identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Website, to operate its systems properly or to protect itself or its users.

**For young visitors and their parents**

The Website is not directed toward children (individuals under thirteen years of age). We do not permit registration or use of the Website by anyone under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children.

**Opting-out of the transfer of personal information**

You may choose to “opt-out” of any transfer of personally identifiable information to a third party as described in this Privacy Policy. You may “opt-out” by contacting us at [privacy@efinancialcareers.com](mailto:privacy@efinancialcareers.com), or by checking any "opt-out" boxes that may be provided during the registration process regarding sharing with other companies. Note that, because we will occasionally need to send you certain email messages that are important to your use of the Website, such as system status updates or order confirmations, you will not be able to "opt out" of receiving such messages.

**How do we protect your information?**

We take reasonable precautions and follow generally accepted industry standards to keep the information we collect secure, including organizational, physical and electronic precautions. Our data networks are protected by advanced firewall and password protection systems. Our security practices and policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary. Our systems are designed so that only authorized individuals are permitted access to the information provided by our visitors. The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). 

There is no complete guarantee of security on the Internet, however. In addition, e-mail that you send us is not necessarily secure against interception. As such, we cannot and do not assume any liability for the theft, loss, misuse or alteration of any information transmitted over the internet. You are ultimately responsible for the security of your user name and password. If you have to write it down, please keep your user name separate from your password.

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Website.

However, in the event that we sell our business, we reserve the right to transfer personal information collected in connection with the business, together with other assets of the business. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that the buyer will continue to treat personal information in a manner consistent with applicable privacy laws. You will be notified via emailWebsite of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.

**Agents/Service Providers**

We use a third party such as a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. When you sign up for these services, we will share your personally identifiable information as necessary for the third party to provide that service. 

**Log Files**

As is true of most Websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. 

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. 

We do link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information. 

**Cookies**

A cookie is a piece of information that is stored on your computer's hard drive by your web browser. On revisiting [www.efinancialcareers.com](http://www.efinancialcareers.com/) our computer server will recognize the cookie, giving us information about your last visit. Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but usually you can alter the settings of your browser to prevent automatic acceptance. If you choose not to receive cookies, you may still use most of the features of our Website, including purchasing items. Cookies are linked to personally identifiable information.

Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. See “Third Party Advertisers.”

This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by this site only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

**Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)**

We employ (or our third party advertising partner employs) a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information. 

**Third Party Advertisers**

The ads appearing on this Website are delivered to users by DoubleClick, our advertising partner. We share Website usage information about users with a reputable third party DoubleClick for the purpose of targeting our Internet banner advertisements on this site. 

DoubleClick uses cookies and clear gifs on this site, which allow it to recognize a user's cookie when a user visits this site. The information that DoubleClick collects and shares through this technology is not personally identifiable. 

**Links to Other Sites**

This Website contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by this Website. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. 

This Website utilizes framing and masking techniques to make it appear that the user is still on the site when the user is actually on a third party Website.

We also have co-branding relationships with certain partners. In these relationships, you will notice the eFinancialCareers platform on our partners page. In this situation, both parties are collecting your data and both privacy policies govern the data collected. We will not share your data with third parties without your consent in these and other relationships. 

We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Website that collects personally identifiable information. 

This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Website. 

**Forums/Bulletin Boards/Comments**

If you contribute to any user generated forum on this Website (for example: answers, debate, comments), you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.

**Send-to-Friend**

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about a job, we will ask you for your friend’s email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. We use this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email, and do not store these email addresses.
