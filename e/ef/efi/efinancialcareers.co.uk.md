Privacy Policy  
**eFinancialCareers is committed to safeguarding the privacy of our users whilst providing personalised career management services.**  
Note: Any reference to 'we' or 'us', 'our' or website are references to the website www.eFinancialCareers.com, the eFinancialCareers network of career sites, and all of our partner career centres. eFinancialCareers provides links to the websites of many other companies to which this policy does not apply.   
**Summary**   
In general, we gather information about all of our users in relation to general site usage and use that data in aggregate form only. We may share that aggregate information with partners and clients in order to demonstrate eFinancialCareers and enable them to improve their use of the service. 

We use the personal information that we collect from you to process your registration, provide personal career management tools (such as job search agents, résumé databases), identify personal preferences and match your needs with relevant products and services.   
  
**Personal Information**   
We respect your personal information and undertake to comply with applicable UK Privacy legislation from time to time in place. 

When you register with the Website, you will be asked to provide us with certain personal information. We do not disclose information about your individual visits to the website or personal information that you provide, such as your name, address, email address, etc. without your permission except when we believe the law requires it. However we may disclose to our partners and third parties, on an anonymous basis, certain aggregate information contained in your personal information. 

We reserve the right to offer third party services and products to you based on the preferences that you identify in your registration and at any time thereafter; such offers may be made by us or by our partners via us. You may change your preferences at any time by emailing [privacy@efinancialcareers.com](mailto:privacy@efinancialcareers.com).   
  
**Consent**   
You signify your consent to us collecting and using this information by your registration on this website. Should for any reason we elect to change our Policy, we will notify you of those changes both here, and by email if identifiable personal data is involved so that you may make an informed decision and keep your preferences up to date. In addition, your data may sometimes also be used by us to inform you about new services on or functionality changes to our web site. If you do not wish to receive this information, please send an e-mail to [privacy@efinancialcareers.com](mailto:privacy@efinancialcareers.com). 

**What and how do we collect information about you and how is it used?**   
1\. Certain eFinancialCareers services require registration or login prior to access, this is to ensure confidentiality. 

2\. We will collect information about your tastes and preferences both when you tell us what these are and by analysis of customer traffic, including by using cookies (see below). 

3\. If you enter a contest or promotion we will ask for your name, address and e-mail address. This is so we can administer the contest and inform the winners. 

4\. We use information collected about you to personalise your visits to our web site and recommend goods or services to you. We also use the information to help us develop the design and layout of our web site to ensure that our sites are as useful and enjoyable as possible. 

5\. Sometimes we might use the information to let you know about new services on or functionality changes to our web site. If you do not wish to receive this information, please send an e-mail to [privacy@efinancialcareers.com](mailto:privacy@efinancialcareers.com). 

6\. Résumés. The eFinancialCareers confidential résumé database enables you to anonymously and confidentially profile your skills and experience to recruiters. 

When activated your résumé is viewable by recruiters but remains anonymous; your name and contact information remain confidential and their release remains in your control at all times. If a recruiter wishes to contact you they do so by sending an email to eFinancialCareers quoting the number of your résumé and details of their opportunity, this email is subsequently forwarded to you. 

It is your decision as to whether you respond to the opportunity or not. If you choose to do so you will contact the recruiter directly, eFinancialCareers does not contact recruiters on your behalf (unless, on each occasion, you expressly authorise us to do so) nor do we recommend or give an opinion to any party as to the suitability of the job opportunity, you, the recruiter or employer. 

We try to ensure that the ability to contact individuals in the résumé database is restricted to bona-fide clients such as recruiters, hiring managers, consultants and HR professionals. However, we are not responsible if some other third party posing as a bona-fide recruiter becomes a client, gains access to the résumé database and subsequently contacts you. You may remove your résumé(s) from our database at any time. However you should note that current or former clients of eFinancialCareers may have retained a copy of your anonymous résumé in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use or privacy of this résumé in these circumstances.   
  
**Will we disclose the information we collect to third parties?**   
We do not disclose information about your individual visits to the website or personal information that you provide, such as your name, address, email address, telephone number etc. except when we believe the law requires it. However we may disclose to our partners and third parties, on an anonymous basis, certain aggregate information contained in your personal information. 

eFinancialCareers.com reserves the right to access and disclose individually identifiable information to comply with applicable laws and lawful government requests, to operate its systems properly or to protect itself or its users.   
  
**How do we protect your information?**   
When you review your information, we offer the use of a secure server. The secure server software encrypts the information that you input before it is transmitted to us. In addition, we have strict security procedures covering the storage and disclosure of your information in order to prevent unauthorised access to comply with the UK Data Protection Act of 1998, The Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003, and other relevant legislation. This means that sometimes we may ask for proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you.
