<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p class="intro">Efficient Frontier, Inc. ["Efficient Frontier"] has established
this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate its firm commitment to privacy.
The following policy is applicable to Efficient Frontier's information
collecting, use and disclosure practices for the Efficient Frontier
web site. Your use of this site tells us you have read and accept the
practices outlined in this policy.</p>
				<nobr><img src="images/clear.gif" width="1" height="28" border="0"></nobr><br>
				<table width="412" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

						This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Efficient Frontier does not own or control or to people it does not employ or manage.  
						<p>
						Efficient Frontier’s policy regarding use of your individual identifying information supplied to us or collected via your visit to our web site covers these areas: 
						</p><p>
						<strong>Information Collection and Use</strong><br>
						Efficient Frontier is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways that vary from what is disclosed in this statement. Efficient Frontier collects information from our users at several different points on our web site. This may include traffic data including user’s IP address, domain server, type of computer, and type of web browser. This is anonymous information that does not personally identify a user but is helpful for marketing purposes or for improving a user’s experience on the site. Efficient Frontier also uses “cookies” to customize content specific to user’s interests.
						</p><p>
						Personal information, such as a user’s name, address, company function, and contact information may be gathered from you on a voluntary basis. Users need not submit this information to use the site. 
						</p><p>
						Clients also have the ability to use this site to obtain information on their accounts. For clients to access and use these services, Efficient Frontier requires them to provide Efficient Frontier with information that personally identifies them. This may include client’s name, mailing address, and email address as well as user name and password. If a client communicates with Efficient Frontier through email or completes an online form or survey, information provided may be collected.
						</p><p>
						As a part of its services, Efficient Frontier compiles and stores data and information and generates reports related to client’s access to and use of Efficient Frontier’s services.
						</p><p>
						Efficient Frontier uses user and client information collected to send users and clients information about our products and services or promotional material from some of our partners, or to contact users or clients when necessary. Efficient Frontier also uses user and client information to provide a better experience on the web site and to improve our client services.
						</p><p>
						As we continue to develop our business, we may sell certain of our assets. In such transactions, visitor information likely will be one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the event that Efficient Frontier, or substantially all of its assets is acquired, our visitor information may be an asset that is reviewed and transferred. Such a transaction will be disclosed per our “Notification of Changes” guidelines below.  
						</p><p>
						<strong>Registration</strong><br>
						In general, when you visit our web site and access information, you remain anonymous. Some areas of our web site may require registration to access, although typically all that is required is your e-mail address and some basic information about you, such as name, company name and job function. Registered clients may have a user name and password to access their company information. 
						</p><p>
						<strong>Subscription </strong><br>
						Site users have the opportunity to subscribe to Efficient Frontier’s mailing list, by filling out an optional form. In order to subscribe, a user may be required to give basic information (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact the user about press releases, corporate announcements and the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. No other use of this information is made by Efficient Frontier unless otherwise indicated on this site, or in future communications with the user. Out of respect to your privacy, we provide a way to unsubscribe.
						</p><p>
						<strong>Log Files</strong><br>
						We may use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track users’ movements and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. Unless otherwise indicated, this information is not shared with anyone outside of Efficient Frontier and/or its designated contractors. When shared with contractors, usage is for the purpose of analyzing user trends and demographics. No IP addresses will be shared with any third party other than for such research and reporting services for Efficient Frontier’s internal use. 
						</p><p>
						<strong>Cookies</strong><br>
						A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Efficient Frontier uses cookies to enhance the user experience of our web site by means such as storing password or user preference information. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site with the only drawback being the disablement of some of the usability features of our site. Some of our business partners may use cookies on their site. However, we have no access to or control over these cookies. 
						</p><p>
						<strong>Information Sharing and Disclosure</strong><br>
						Efficient Frontier may partner with third party contractors to help process orders and provide other services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 
						</p><p>
						We may share aggregated demographic information about our user base with our partners and clients. This information does not identify individual users. 
						</p><p>
						<strong>Legal Disclaimer</strong><br>
						We reserve the right to disclose personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our web site.  
						</p><p>
						<strong>Clear Gifs</strong><br>
						We employ a software technology called clear gifs that help us better manage content on client web sites. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.  
						</p><p>
						<strong>Our Clients</strong><br>
						Efficient Frontier serves as an agent for each of its clients, in that we provide our services for the benefit of the client. Each of our clients uses our services to maximize their advertising campaign. Each client instructs us as to what types of data it would like us to collect on its behalf. This data may include search engine referral and purchase behavior and information.  
						</p><p>
						<strong>Efficient Frontier may track certain actions on clients' web sites,</strong><br>
						including web surfers visiting certain pages on the client’s sites or taking specific actions. We use persistent cookies and clear GIFs to determine activity at the client’s site. With respect to individuals who visit those sites as a result of clicking on a customer ad on a search engines, our ad server will place or read a unique tracking cookie on the computer and will use non-personal information about the browser and activity at this site (such as a web surfer's IP address, web pages which have been viewed by a web surfer, date and time) to track whether the referral results in a transaction, as defined by the customer.
						</p><p>
						<strong>Links</strong><br>
						This web site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that Efficient Frontier is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this web site. 
						</p><p>
						<strong>Security</strong><br>
						Efficient Frontier has implemented generally accepted standards of technology security in order to protect information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. 
						</p><p>
						<strong>Correction/Updating Personal Information</strong><br>
						If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code or email address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user’s personal data provided to us. This can usually be done by emailing <a href="Mailto:webmaster@efrontier.com">webmaster@efrontier.com</a>.
						</p><p>
						<strong>Choice/Opt-out</strong>
						Users who no longer wish to receive press releases, corporate announcements, or promotional materials may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to that email with the word unsubscribe in the subject line of the emailed reply or email us at <a href="Mailto:webmaster@efrontier.com">webmaster@efrontier.com</a>. 
						</p><p>
						We encourage our clients to follow generally acceptable privacy standards.  As a visitor to our site, you can deactivate our ability to analyze your behavior. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) 
						</p><p>
						<strong>Notification of Changes</strong><br>
						If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to post those changes on our homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner.
						</p><p>

						If you have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us at <a href="Mailto:webmaster@efrontier.com">webmaster@efrontier.com</a>.
