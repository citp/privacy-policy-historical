# EFF: Privacy Policy (May 22, 2002)

The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is committed to protecting the privacy of visitors to our website, as well as our members and activists. 

In this policy "EFF" refers to EFF staff, board members, cooperating attorneys, interns, volunteers and consultants, all of whom are bound by law or contract to keep information they receive as part of their assistance to EFF confidential. 

As to all of the information described below, EFF will not give, sell, rent or exchange the information with anyone else without your prior consent except as compelled by law (see the final section). 

### Website Privacy Policy

EFF servers may record the numerical Internet protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using; the browser software you use and your operating system; the date and time you access our site; and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our site. 

We use this information to measure the number of visitors to different sections of the site, to diagnose and correct system errors, and to improve the site. We delete this information after one month. 

We do not connect this information to your name or identity. 

We do not use "cookies" on this site unless you decide to click on "Remember Me" or other similar functionality. 

### Membership Privacy Policy

EFF will never share or use your personal information for any reason other than to manage your membership or contribution. These records are stored with a third-party grassroots campaign consultant, Kintera. Our agreement with Kintera specifies that the records cannot be reproduced (except for back-up copies) and cannot be disclosed to anyone, or used for any purpose, without EFF's prior written consent. EFF will never grant that consent.

We respect anonymous donations. Please note that your email address is required if you choose to donate using our online form.

We do not retain credit card information. If you choose to have us make automatic monthly withdrawals from your account, we do retain your credit card information for that sole purpose. These credit card numbers are kept in a secure, offline location and are processed in a secure online batch once per month.

### Action Center Privacy Policy

There are a number of ways to subscribe to the EFF Action Center, including submitting a form at our website, opting in when you send a message through our action center, or mailing a sign-up form from a brochure or flier. When you subscribe, you will receive a confirmation message welcoming you to the EFF Action Center. 

When you subscribe to the EFF Action Center, we collect your name, email address, city, state, postal code, and country of residence. If you opt in, we will use your email address to send you updates and alerts on protecting your rights in the digital world, so you may take action, such as contacting your representative in Congress or attending an event. 

You may remove your name from our email list at any time by sending a request to [alerts@action.eff.org](mailto:alerts@action.eff.org). 

We do not use "cookies" on this site unless you decide to click on "Remember Me" or other similar functionality. 

### Compelled Disclosure

If we are required by law to disclose the information that you have submitted, we will attempt to provide you with notice (unless we are prohibited) that a request for your information has been made in order to give you an opportunity to object to the disclosure. We will attempt to provide this notice by email, if you have given us an email address, or by postal mail if you have entered a postal address. We will independently object to overly broad requests for access to information about users of our site. If you do not challenge the disclosure request, we may be legally required to turn over your information.
