## What personally identifiable information of yours is collected

We collect aggregate information site-wide, including anonymous site stats. We also log domain names and/or IP addresses. On certain pages such as the EFF Membership Form, we give users the option of providing us with names, addresses, phone numbers, fax numbers, email addresses, demographic, preference and other personal information, and various other kinds of details. This more personal information is not gathered by us without users' knowing and active permission and participation. 

## What organization is collecting the information

The information is gathered by the Electronic Frontier Foundation itself, generally speaking. Contact and other information about our users might be collected by third parties that fulfill orders, verify credit cards, process orders in online currencies and pseudo-currencies. These off-site assistants and fulfillment houses will be required by us to make no further use of such information, nor disclose it to others, just like in-house EFF employees, whenever they are contracted with EFF. (In other cases, such a service might be independently subscribed to by the user, and any privacy policy of that service will be an agreement between the service and the user, not between the service and EFF.)

## How the information is used

We review and discard the information in some cases (e.g. IP address logs for file transfers), while in others we may use the information to tailor our users' web experience, generate anonymous statistics, or to contact users via email or postal mail (e.g. to send newsletters, action alerts, pledge drive promotions, etc.) We do not send such messages without permission. That is, the user must voluntarily subscribe to our mailing lists. Personal information that has been volunteered to us may also be combined with data from third parties, such as Congressional district maps, to improve our services to members. No such combining will be done for marketing purposes. If the user permits, we may also share the information with other, similar, non-profit orgainizations. This option is "off" by default. 

## With whom the information may be shared

EFF may share (but to date has not shared) members' contact information, only with permission, to similar non-profit organizations. This operates on an opt-in basis (i.e. your information will not be shared in this way unless you personally allow it.) 

## What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information

Our opt-out policy is that you may opt out of any use by us of information you have provided to us (and in fact you have to opt in voluntarily for any such use to happen in the first place.) Our delete/deactivate policy is the same as our opt-out policy - if you want to be removed from our membership roster, mailing lists or other databases, just let us know.

If you would like to opt-out of any use of your personally identifiable information by us, or be removed from this site's database, please contact:

> Electronic Frontier Foundation  
>  attn: Membership Director  
>  1550 Bryant Street, Suite 725  
>  San Francisco CA 94103  USA 
> 
> membership@eff.org
> 
> +1 415 436 9333  
>  +1 415 436 9993 (fax)

## How you can correct any inaccuracies in this information

Our change and update policy is simple - you simply tell us what the correct information is, and we'll update our membership or other relevant records. 

If you would like to correct and/or update your personally identifiable information, please contact:

> Electronic Frontier Foundation  
>  attn: Membership Director  
>  1550 Bryant Street, Suite 725

>  +1 415 436 9993 (fax)

## What kind of security procedures are in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information under the company's control

Our databases, including the member database, and system administrations logs, are password protected. Online transactions of a sensitive nature, e.g. credit card numbers, are protected by secure browser connections. Users whose browsers do not support encryption are encouraged to conduct their transactions by encrypted e-mail. Our PGP public key is available at [http://www.eff.org/pub/EFF/effkeys.pgp](http://www.eff.org/pub/EFF/effkey.pgp).

## Other Information About Your Privacy at This Site

This site is a co-founder of the TRUSTe program (an international initiative for establishing consumer trust and confidence in electronic transactions by protecting online privacy via industry-standard online privacy policy disclosure.) 

EFF's site generally stores no information about its visitors, with the exceptions of basic logging for site stats (just machine addresses, not personal email addresses), and information provided by users who fill out our online membership, order, guestbook, or contest forms. Under no circumstances does EFF compile "audit trails" of which users are browsing what pages, and under no circumstances will EFF sell, rent, loan or give personally identifiable user information to marketeers. 

[Here are some genuine examples of what our logs contain.](http://www.eff.org/onsite_logexamples.html)

EFF's site does not monitor private communications (e.g. email) at all, much less make any use of such communications. 

EFF's site does not display or make available users' or members' personal information, such as contact information, even if it is already publicly available.
