We use your IP address to help administer our Web site and diagnose any problems with our server. Your IP address may also be used by a third part anonymously to gather broad demographic information for research purposes. Personally identifiable information will not be linked to IP addresses.

**Your Information Security**

We take [website security](https://www.websafeshield.com/) seriously, and have engaged WebSafe Shield to help us provide it. WebSafe Shield provides a service similar to [McAfee Secure](http://www.websafeshield.com/Compare-McAfee-Secure.html)'s daily scanning service, and we are notified as security vulnerabilities are descovered. WebSafe Shield is a leading and trusted security service that offers additional services ranging from [PCI Compliance](https://www.websafeshield.com/PCI-Compliance.html) to [Application Penetration Testing](http://www.websafeshield.com/application-penetration-testing.html). 

eForCity uses the Security for merchants from Yahoo! Services. Yahoo! uses SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption while transmitting certain kinds of information, such as financial services information or payment information. An icon resembling a padlock is displayed at the bottom of most browser windows during SSL transactions that involve credit cards and other forms of payment. Credit card numbers are SSL encrypted whenever Yahoo! requests it for payment or verification purposes. Customer information will be stored securely on our servers. Once customers choose to store or enter a credit card number on Yahoo!, it will not be displayed in its entirety when customers retrieve or edit it in the future. Instead of the entire number, customers will only see asterisks and either the first four digits or the last four digits of the number.

For information about Yahoo store Security see [Security at Yahoo!](http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/us/yahoo/security/).
