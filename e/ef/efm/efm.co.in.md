This Privacy Policy describes what personal information You may share with Recharge Duniya, as data controller, and other Users when activating and using the Recharge Duniya Services, how Recharge Duniya receives, collects and uses this data and how You may opt-out at any time, altogether preventing use of the data shared via the Services.

Information Collected and Received

Recharge Duniya also uses this information to provide you with tailored content, such as search results and advertisements more relevant to You.

For details regarding permission usage in connection with installation on the Android platform, please see the Recharge Duniya FAQ at www.Recharge Duniya.com/support.

User Profile

Where the User registers a user profile in the Recharge Duniya Apps and via SMS or inbound call verification confirms being the holder of a certain number, the information up-loaded to the profile section of the Recharge Duniya Apps will be received and stored by Recharge Duniya until the User changes or deletes such data or terminates the Services. Compulsory information when creating a profile page is the User’s first name, last name and phone number and additional information that may be provided at the User’s option include, but is not limited to, photo, gender, street address and zip code, country of residence, email address, professional website, Facebook page, Twitter address and a short status message. Recharge Duniya may supplement the information provided or collected with information from third parties and add it to information provided by You. For example, collection and use of demographic information that is publicly available and additional contact information as allowed by applicable national laws.

Please note that any content uploaded to and displayed in the user profile by the User is not moderated by Recharge Duniya and is not protected under the Swedish Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression. The User is solely liable for the publication of such content. Please see the Terms of Service for further information regarding protection under the Swedish Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression.

Identifiers

In addition, You may provide us with Your user identifier information regarding certain third party services, i.e. Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn and Twitter, necessary for the application to interoperate with such third party services. In that case Recharge Duniya will store and process also that information (and also a mapped photo where applicable), for as long as You use the Services and will not use this information for any other purpose than required in order to obtain interoperability and functionality in relation to such third party services. Please note that we never store any passwords to the mentioned third party services.

Contact Information

Where the Recharge Duniya Apps are obtained from other sources than Apple App Store or Google Play, You may share the names, numbers and email addresses contained in Your device’s address book (“Contact Information”) with Recharge Duniya for the purpose described below under Enhanced Search. If you provide us with personal information about someone else, you confirm that they are aware that You have provided their data and that they consent to our processing of their data according to our Privacy Policy.

Where the Recharge Duniya Apps are obtained from Apple App Store or Google Play, we will only use permitted Contact Information to make our Services more relevant to You and Your engagement with the Recharge Duniya community.

In addition to Contact Information, if You choose to activate use of a third party social network service, such as Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn or Twitter, within the Recharge Duniya Apps, Recharge Duniya may up-load, store and use the list of identifiers associated with said services linked to the Contact Information in order to enhance the results shared with other Users.

Please note that no other Contact Information than the phone numbers and thereto attached names and email addresses will be received, stored and used from the User’s address book. Other numbers or information that may be contained in your device’s phone book will be filtered away and will therefore not be stored or used by Recharge Duniya. Addresses, passwords and credit card numbers and any other similar information will automatically be prevented from being entered into the Recharge Duniya database by our safety algorithms, that filters any numbers and other information stored in the phone book in a number sequence not compatible with that used for telephone numbers. Please also note that You can always choose not to share Contact Information with Recharge Duniya and if You have shared information and changed Your mind, You can easily delist Your number or opt-out to render your entire Contact Information unavailable for search in the database for Enhanced Search.

Name tagging

We may also associate a name with a phone number through the name tagging functionality, which allows a User who receives a call from a phone number which is not associated with a name in the Recharge Duniya database to indicate a name to be associated with that number. A name will only be associated with a number through this functionality if a sufficient number of independent Users, based on our algorithm, have indicated the same name for the relevant number.

Call Block

Where a User within the Services reports a phone number as spam, Recharge Duniya stores that phone number in combination with the User’s RegisterID in order to maintain the User’s spam list online but also for the purpose of building a community based spam blocking directory. On the Android platform, the User can also add a name to the phone number in question that will only be visible to that User.

RDuedialer

With the rddialer app and functionality You are provided with a fast and smart dialer for Your phone that, among other features, will provide instant search results from Your phonebook, populate unidentified numbers in your call log and provide unique search results from the Recharge Duniya database. Apart from Your location when performing an active search, and exclusively for the purpose of optimizing the search result, no further data or information than accounted for in the Terms and this Privacy Policy will be processed when You use the rddialer app (and such location data will not be stored).

rdmessenger

With the rdmessenger app You are provided with an SMS and MMS messaging service. In order to facilitate the delivery of your messages through the rdmessenger app, Recharge Duniya may store your messages in encrypted form for a limited period of time. However, Recharge Duniya does not monitor the content of such messages.

Use, Sharing and Disclosure of User and Contact Information

Information related to the User or Contact Information will be used to:

(a) display the name associated with a certain number at a manual number search against the Recharge Duniya database,

(b) automatically display the caller’s name when a call is received, as enabled by the Enhanced Search functionality, as described below, to Users who have activated that functionality, and indicate possible common connections with the caller or when an incoming call may be spam,

(c) display the “who viewed my profile” and “availability” functionalities of the Services,

(d) provide selected Recharge Duniya partners with limited information in order to enhance user experience, service functionality and data accuracy, provided that these partners adhere to strict confidentiality provisions no less protective of your rights than the Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy,

(e) enable the Recharge Duniya Name Search, as described below, to Users who have activated that functionality,

(f) contact You from Recharge Duniya for verification purposes or with information pertaining to the Services, e.g. newsletter e-mails and similar notifications, and verify provided User Profile information with third party providers,

(g) deliver messages through the rdmessenger app,

(h) enable You to use and share Your user information in connection with Your use of third party services,

(i) customize, maintain, measure, improve our Services and develop new ones,

(j) personalize, measure and improve our advertising and use geo-location information to provide You with location based information and services (such as more relevant advertising, search results and other personalized content).

Enhanced Search functionality and database

To improve the Services, Recharge Duniya has created a searchable database where the Users generate the content and via the Enhanced Search functionality are offered access to this database, containing Contact Information from those Users who permit such aggregation. In return these Users are allowed to access to the database by querying it. Queries against the database are only allowed through the Recharge Duniya Services by Users who have explicitly approved of the Service's functionality and integrity restrictions as contained in the Recharge Duniya Terms of Service, the API License Addendum and this Privacy Policy.

The queries against the Recharge Duniya Enhanced Search database are processed only if a numeric phone number is attributed to the query and only if no results are published by an associated or partnering database of Recharge Duniya. The response given to the queried number will be the associated name to that number, if any name is available.

It is important to notice the following distinctions. As an integrity and security measure, only numeric queries are allowed against the Recharge Duniya database for Enhanced Search, i.e. there will be no result to a name query. Name searches may, however, give result via the Services if a partnering or associated database to Recharge Duniya has numbers available to the name queries. The Users contributing to Enhanced Search can therefore rely on that the Contact Information provided, as a personal integrity precaution, will not enable anyone searching for the number to a certain person direct access to that number. In some cases, Users may, however, use the Services to forward a request to a named person in order to get in touch, please see below about the Recharge Duniya Name Search service.

The database may also – via a “social graph” algorithm - be used to show the User what other Users he or she, directly or indirectly, has in common with another User and to suggest other contacts they may have in common. Please note that, if You are presented as a person that the User who made the query may know or as a “similar” person, some of Your profile information entered by you, excluding phone number, will be disclosed to such User.

Name Search

Your name and telephone number and any other information You choose to submit on Your User Profile will be visible to the person You reach out to when requesting a contact via the Recharge Duniya Name Search service. Your request will be forwarded to that person via an SMS and he or she may choose to share the phone number with You (of which You in such case will be informed of via a push notification), or not, at his or her own discretion, but may also block further request from You or to opt-out of the service altogether at any time. Nobody will under any circumstances receive more than three contact requests via the Recharge Duniya Name Search service during any 24 hours and has anybody received nine requests during the last 72 hours, that person will not receive additional requests for the next 72 hours. Excessive requests not delivered will be put on hold in chronological order, unless the recipient actively allows further requests to be forwarded.

Via the Recharge Duniya Name Search service You may be recommended, via a push notification, when there are new contacts that you may know and be interested in getting in touch with.

Opt-Out and Delist Numbers

If a User chooses to disable the Enhanced Search functionality, the Contact Information made available by that User is disabled and will thereafter not be accessible for queries. If any persons do not wish to have their names and phone numbers made available through the Enhanced Search or Name Search functionalities, they can exclude themselves from further queries by notifying Recharge Duniya via its website at www.Recharge Duniya.com or as set forth in the contact details below.

Miscellaneous

In addition to the above Recharge Duniya may disclose information related to the Users and Contact Information if we believe such action is necessary to:

(a) comply with the law, or legal process served on us;

(b) protect and defend our rights or property (including the enforcement of our agreements); or

(c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of Users or members of the public.

You control the personal information You allow us to have access to through the privacy settings on the respective third party service and the permissions You give us when You grant us access to the personal information about You retained by the respective third party service.
