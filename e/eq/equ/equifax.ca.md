Your credit information is reported to Equifax, with consent or as permitted by law, from various sources, such as credit grantors, collection agencies, government entities (e.g., Family Responsibility Office) and Legal Suppliers (e.g., Court House Reporters).  We also gather personal information from you directly when you contact us to receive a copy of your credit report, update your information or purchase products and services from us.

### Your rights to access and correct your personal information:

You are entitled to receive your credit report from Equifax at no charge upon written request.  We encourage all consumers to request and review their credit report on a regular basis. By doing this, you can ensure that your report contains information that accurately reflects your credit history. You have the right to dispute any discrepancies by immediately notifying us in writing and we will investigate to ensure the items reported are factual.  Where a piece of information cannot be verified by the reporting source, we will remove it from your credit file.

You also have a right to access the other personal information belonging to you that is under our control subject to any legal restrictions or rights of refusal.  Such a request for access must be made in writing stating the details of the personal information you are requesting to Equifax’s Chief Privacy Office at Chief Privacy Officer, Equifax Canada Co. 5700 Yonge St., Suite 1501, Toronto ON M2M 4K2.  To ensure we disclosure information to you only, with your request please include photocopies (front and back) of two (2) pieces of government issued photo id so that we may verify your identity.

### Safeguarding your personal information:

Equifax maintains strict security safeguards when storing or destroying your personal information in order to prevent unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks.  These standards are in place for all information, regardless of how it is stored and we regularly review, test and enhance our systems to ensure they meet accepted industry standards.  We also limit the number of employees who may access your personal information on a need-to-know basis: this means that only employees who would need to discuss your information with you, generate a credit report or other related products or services, or conduct investigations to verify and correct your credit report, would have access to your personal information.  We conduct due diligence on, and impose the same high standards that we implement internally for, our members who are permitted to access your information from us.

In the event that we transfer your personal information to a third party in Canada or across borders for processing, we contractually require such third party to protect your personal information in a manner consistent with our privacy safeguarding measures, subject to the law in the third party jurisdiction.

Where your consent is required for credit information to be reported to Equifax or received from Equifax, such consent is obtained from you by the source (e.g., credit grantor).  You may request a free copy of your credit file from Equifax for a full list of companies that have accessed your credit file and that are reporting information to Equifax.  Please note that withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to continue to receive certain products and services from these companies.
