                                This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When
                            users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected

                            <p>
                                When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such
                            as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the
                            best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as
                            our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator
                            and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open,
                            when you are just 'surfing'.</p>
                            <p>
                                While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also
                            do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users'
                            information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in
                            our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for
                            example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access
                            to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected
                            screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their
                            password to re-gain access to your information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept
                            up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any
                            time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the
                            importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information
                            is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information
                            on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.</p>
