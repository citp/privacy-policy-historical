**Information we collect and how we use it**

We offer a service that requires you to register for an account and provide some personal and business information to us. In order to provide our services, we may collect the following types of information:

We also request that our customers provide credit card or other payment account information, which is encrypted and securely maintained at Authorize.Net. This information is collected for internal use only and will not be sold to or shared with third-party firms.

•  |  **Information security** – We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction of data. These security measures include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices, and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. We restrict access to personal information by EquityNet employees and third party service providers who need to know that information in order to operate, develop, or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.

Personal information that you provide directly to such sites may constitute privacy issues outside the bounds of the EquityNet Privacy Policies. EquityNet does not exercise control over linked sites and does not collect information as a result of your contact with those sites.   
•  |  **Business merger or acquisition** – In the event that EquityNet, LLC goes through a business merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, personal and business information may be among the assets transferred. EquityNet, LLC will provide notification on its website for a minimum of 30 days if any such change in ownership takes place.
