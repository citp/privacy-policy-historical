**Information we collect and how we use it**

We offer a service that requires you to register for an account and provide some personal and enterprise information to us. In order to provide our services, we may collect the following types of information: 

| •  |  **Information you provide** – When you sign up for an EquityNet account, we ask you for personal information (such as your name, address, phone number, email address, and account username and password). We also request that our Investor Customers provide credit card or other payment account information, which we maintain in encrypted form on secure servers. This information is collected for internal use only and will not be sold to or shared with third-party firms.   
---|---  
•  |  **Information security** – We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction of data. These security measures include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices, and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. We restrict access to personal information to EquityNet employees and third party service providers who need to know that information in order to operate, develop, or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.   
•  |  **Aggregate data collection and use** – We may collect enterprise data information that may be used by us in an anonymous aggregate form. This information will not be used with an identification of individual users or individual enterprises. Transparency of user and enterprise data related to an identifiable enterprise is restricted to recipient users who have been specifically authorized to view such information by the originating and authorizing user.   
•  |  **User communications** – Email or other communication sent to EquityNet, may be retained in order to process your inquiries, to respond to your requests, and to improve our services.   
•  |  **Affiliated sites** – We may offer links to other websites as part of our services. Personal information that you provide directly to such sites may constitute privacy issues outside the bounds of the EquityNet Privacy Policies. EquityNet does not exercise control over linked sites and does not collect information as a result of your contact with those sites.   
•  |  **Business merger or acquisition** – In the event that EquityNet, LLC goes through a business merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, anonymous aggregate data information may be among the assets transferred. EquityNet, LLC will provide notification on its website for a minimum of 30 days if any such change in ownership takes place.   
  
**Enforcement**

EquityNet will regularly review its compliance with this Policy. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Policy or EquityNet's use of information by contacting use via our website. When we receive formal written complaints at this address, it is EquityNet’s policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of data that cannot be resolved between EquityNet and an individual. 

**Changes to this policy**

Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Policy changes to our Privacy page, and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Policy changes).
