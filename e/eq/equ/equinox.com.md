#### USE OF COOKIES:

We use cookies and similar technologies such as web beacons to enhance your experience on our web site. For example a cookie enables us to remember the region or specific club page you have visited so the next time you return to our site you do not have to select that club or region again.

You can adjust how your Internet browser (like Chrome or Safari) responds to cookies (e.g., to warn you every time a cookie is sent, or to turn off all cookies). See your browser's Help menu for these instructions. By disabling your cookies, please understand you will not have access to some of the features that enhance your user experience on the Digital Properties.

Equinox does not currently allow third parties to collect personally identifiable information about an individual user’s online activities over time and across different websites when that individual uses the Digital Properties and therefore does not respond to web browser “do not track” signals.

Equinox offers membership to individuals who are at least 18 years of age. However, teenagers that are at least 16 years of age may also join with the written consent of a parent.  Similarly, the Digital Properties are intended for use by adults, and when we collect information through the Digital Properties for membership inquiry purposes, users are informed they must be at least 18 years of age or, for teenagers ages 16 to 18, have parental consent to provide personally identifying information to us. The Digital Properties are not intended for children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect or store any personal information from children under the age of 13.
