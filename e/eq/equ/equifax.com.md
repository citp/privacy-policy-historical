**EQUIFAX FAIR INFORMATION PRINCIPLES**

**NOTICE**

 **The Information We Collect About You**  
The Equifax online privacy policy applies to all information we receive online from you and about you in connection with an online transaction. Other than in the situations described below, we do not collect information from or about you while you are accessing and using our web site. If you do not register or fill out any forms at an Equifax web site, such as in connection with a Personal Solutions Product (described below) or making an online reinvestigation request, no information is collected about you. 

We only collect information from you or about you online when you: 1) order products (Personal Solutions Products) from Equifax online; or 2) initiate online reinvestigation services; or 3) register at an Equifax web site. In these situations we collect certain information from and about you to process your request and to verify your identity to be sure that we are providing the Personal Solutions Products or services to the proper individual. This is for your protection and to help eliminate identity fraud and fraudulent orders.

**Information From You**  
Specifically, we receive information from you when you register for and request Personal Solutions Products, such as Equifax Credit ReportTM; Score PowerTM; Equifax Credit WatchTM; 3-in-1 Credit Report and other web-based services we provide through this web site. Additionally, when you order any of these Personal Solutions Products online, in order to verify your identity, we ask you from two to six multiple-choice questions about information contained in your credit file. These are "non-wallet-type" questions to which only you are likely to know the answer. We do not retain your answers to the questions once we have verified your identity.

The specific PII we collect from you online for verification and processing of your requests may include:  


  * First and last name (middle initial and suffix, as applicable); 
  * Social Security number; 
  * Date of birth; 
  * Gender; 
  * Home telephone number; 
  * E-mail address; 
  * Current and former mailing address; 
  * Credit card number and expiration date; and 
  * Drivers license number, state of issue, and address on license 



We also receive information from you on-line when you send us e-mail, applications and other forms, request online reinvestigation or register at our web sites.

You may also order some of the Personal Solutions Products by mail or telephone as described on the Equifax Consumer Solutions website. The decision to order Personal Solutions Products online or by mail or telephone is completely up to you.

**Information From Others**  
We may also collect information about your transactions with us, our affiliates, or others, such as the products and services you ordered. In connection with requests for Personal Solutions Products or online reinvestigation, we access your Equifax credit file information. **We may also collect from outside sources personally identifiable information** about you, such as name, address, driver's license information and e-mail addresses.

**How We Use Information We Collect**  
We **use** the information we collect about you in connection with your ordering or requesting Personal Solutions Products to provide you: 1) the Personal Solutions Products and services you requested; 2) support for these Personal Solutions Products and services; and 3) information about our Personal Solutions Products. We also use this information for various internal business purposes, such as billing, customer service, fraud prevention, and broadening and improving the Personal Solutions Products and services we can offer.

Additionally, we may use the information, including postal address and/or email address, to send you promotions for Personal Solutions Products and services. (Of course, you may opt out of receiving such promotions. See the "CHOICE" section of this privacy policy.)

Information we collect for your online reinvestigation requests is used only to handle those requests.

Information collected when you register at Equifax web sites other than in connection with Personal Solutions Products is used for the purposes identified on those web site registration forms.

**To Whom We May Disclose The Information We Collect**  
We may disclose any of the information we collect from or about you, as described above, to the following types of unaffiliated third parties (companies that are not owned or controlled by us) for various business purposes, including marketing and joint business efforts for related and unrelated products and services: 

  * Financial services providers, such as banks and mortgage lenders; 
  * Non-financial companies such as retailers, direct marketers and publishers; 
  * Companies that perform marketing services on our behalf and other financial institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements; and 
  * Others, as permitted by law. 



We may also disclose any of the information we collect, as described above, to affiliates, which are companies that are related to us by common ownership or affiliated with us by common control.

We may disclose any of the information, as described above, to the types of affiliates and unaffiliated third parties, also as described above, whether you are an individual who purchases a one-time Personal Solutions Product or one with whom we have an ongoing or prior relationship.

We do not disclose (sell, rent or provide) the **personally identifiable information** you provide to us online at our Personal Solutions website to any third party for any marketing purposes, except in connection with the marketing of some of our Personal Solutions Products [(www.econsumer.equifax.com)](http://econsumer.equifax.com/) Information that we collect pursuant to online reinvestigation requests may be disclosed to our affiliates, as well non-affiliated third parties, such as consumer credit reporting agencies on the Equifax credit reporting system that own the credit file, and sources of the disputed information including credit grantors and public record vendors. Information is only disclosed as required to handle the online reinvestigation request.

When PII is collected when you register at an Equifax web site other than as described above, the information will be disclosed, if at all, only with your permission

If you prefer that we not disclose to nonaffiliated third parties any PII that we collect about you in connection with any of the online Personal Solutions Products that you obtain from us, you may choose to opt out of such disclosures; that is, you may direct us not to make these disclosures.

**Opting Out at Our Personal Solutions Web Page**

**ACCESS**

If you have ordered a Personal Solutions Product, you can, at any time, go to the Member Center on the Equifax Personal Solutions Web page to review and change your user ID, password, email address, and secret question. Other PII, such as name, postal address, and Social Security number, are collected and stored when you order a Personal Solutions Product online. Since this information is not maintained in a form retrievable by consumers, we are not able to provide you access to it. However, you can makes changes, corrections or updates to that PII by re-registering at the Member Center of the Equifax Personal Solutions web page. As mentioned in the "How We Use Information" section, this information is maintained in order for Equifax to: 1) comply with legal requirements regarding billing; 2) provide customer support services; and 3) easily provide notices of new Products or enhancements. 

**SECURITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY**

Equifax recognizes the importance of secure online transactions, and we safeguard the privacy of information you provide us through online forms. For your product orders submitted to us online, we use programs that encrypt the information you provide on the order form before transmission to Equifax. The information is decrypted only upon receipt by Equifax. Except as set forth in the" "To Whom We Disclose The Information We Collect" section above, we restrict access to PII that is collected about you to only those who have a need to know that information in connection with the purposes for which it is collected and used. Additionally, we maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to guard your PII. Information you provide us when you register for and order the Personal Solutions Products or services online is transmitted to us through a secured socket layer (SSL) transmission.

Further, we have security protocols and measures in place to protect the PII we maintain about you from unauthorized access or alteration. These measures include internal and external firewalls, physical security and technological security measures, and encryption of certain information.

You also have a role in protecting the security of information about you. For example, you should guard your password to the Member Center and not permit unauthorized use of your account for Products.

**ACCOUNTABILITY**

"Accountability" is generally recognized as an important component of "Fair Information Practices" and refers to the process that a company has in place to be sure it adheres to its privacy policy. It also means that a redress process exists to address privacy policy compliance questions.

We take reasonable precautions to be sure that unaffiliated third parties or affiliates, to whom information is disclosed, as described above, are aware of our privacy policy and fair information principles and that they will treat the **personally identifiable information** in a similarly responsible manner. Our contracts and written agreements with unaffiliated third parties that receive information from us about consumers who have not opted out of this disclosure prevent further transfer of the information.

Equifax is not, however, responsible for the privacy practices or content of link sites listed on our web pages. The owners of these link sites are responsible for them.

In addition to our internal process for reviewing our privacy practices, Equifax has also earned the Better Business Bureau Online Privacy Seal every year since inception of the seal. We adhere to the BBBOnline Privacy Seal Program dispute resolution process (see below), the Direct Marketing Association Privacy Promise, and the Online Privacy Alliance principles.

**Equifax and BBBOnLine**  
Equifax is a proud member of the Council of Better Business Bureaus' BBBOnLine® Privacy Program steering committee, and our web site and online privacy policy at www.Equifax.com conforms to all program policies, including the BBBOnLine Privacy Program Dispute Resolution Process. As such, we have committed to abide by our posted online privacy policy and fair information principles and submit to a comprehensive and independent verification of our online privacy policy and practices by BBBOnLine.

Although Equifax' privacy policy is global in scope, only domestic sites intended for use by U.S. residents participate in the BBBOnLine Privacy Program. Therefore, our international sites, links to which are also provided on our home page, do not participate in the BBBOnLine program, including [http://www.equifax.co.uk](http://www.equifax.co.uk/) (Equifax UK); [http://www.equifax.ca](http://www.equifax.ca/) (Equifax Canada); [http://www.dicom.cl](http://www.dicom.cl/) (Equifax DICOM); [http://www.veraz.com.ar](http://www.veraz.com.ar/) (Equifax Organizacion Veraz); [http://www.sci.com.br](http://www.sci.com.br/) (Equifax Brazil-SCI); [http://www.equifax.com.sv](http://www.equifax.com.sv/) (Equifax DICOM-El Salvador); [http://www.infocorp.com.pe](http://www.infocorp.com.pe/) (Equifax Peru-Infocorp); [http://www.asnefequifax.es](http://www.asnefequifax.es/) (Equifax Spain-ASNEF); [http://www.equifax.it](http://www.equifax.it/) (Equifax Italy); [http://www.clearing.com.uy](http://www.clearing.com.uy/) (Equifax Uruguay).

**Equifax and the Online Privacy Alliance**  
Equifax is also a member of the Online Privacy Alliance (OPA) ([www.privacyalliance.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20021204211617id_/http%3A//www.equifax.com/universal/www.privacyalliance.org)). Equifax and OPA support self-regulatory initiatives that create an environment of trust and that foster the protection of individuals' privacy online and in electronic commerce.

**USE OF COOKIES**

Equifax uses "cookie" technology only during those web sessions during which you access the Personal Solutions web site and register for a User ID and Password, and choose to order Personal Solutions Products during that same session. All other visits to our web site will be anonymous and no cookies are used.

When we do use cookies, as described above, our use of them is limited. Cookies that we use are "per session" and are deleted once your browser is closed. We use these cookies for several purposes; for example, a cookie creates a tracking identification number each time you sign on to the web site. This tracking number makes your registration information accessible for each transaction you make during that visit. This permits you to order more than once during a visit without your having to re-enter your information each time you place an order for a Personal Solutions Product.

**CHILDREN'S PRIVACY**

The Equifax websites where we collect PII in conjunction with a transaction involving ordering products, initiating online investigation and registering are intended for use only by adults. We comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and do not knowingly solicit or collect information from children. Although our "Cool on Credit" website has pages directed at children, no information at all is collected or requested from or about them.

**NON-APPLICABILITY OF PRIVACY POLICY TO COMMERCIAL USE**

This online privacy policy applies to individuals using the Personal Solutions Products and services provided through the web site for personal, family or household purposes. Certain practices described and rights provided herein may not apply to institutional users or individuals who use the Personal Solutions Products for commercial purposes.

**KEEPING UP-TO-DATE ON OUR PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES**

We want you to be fully informed about how we will protect your privacy. We may change our privacy policy in the future, but we will not change our practices until they have been posted at this website. If changes occur, we will also show the date of revision. You agree that we may notify you of changes in our policy through this web site.
