Collection of Information About You.</h2><h3 id="1.1">1.1 Active Information Collection.</h3><p>We may collect Personal Information from you at various places and through various mechanisms on the Web Site. This may include, for example, when you fill out and submit forms (such as forms requesting information needed to consider you for apartment rentals or potential employment opportunities), when you initiate payments to us through the Web Site, when you participate in promotions, contests, or sweepstakes on the Web Site, when you post to any interactive forum, bulletin board, chat room that we may make available on the Web Site, when you register for e-mail communications, and when you submit a survey response, question or request to the Web Site using a form or the e-mail address links on the Web Site.</p><h3 id="1.2">1.2 Passive Information Collection.</h3><p>When you visit the Web Site, we automatically collect certain information about your activities (“<b><i>Web Site Usage Information</i></b>”). Web Site Usage Information is information about your device, including browser and device identifiers such as IP address (“<b><i>Unique ID</i></b>”), and information about how our visitors use and navigate the Web Site. This includes, for example, the number and frequency of visitors to each web page, the length of their stays, the type of browser each visitor is using to view the Web Site (for example, Internet Explorer, Firefox), the type of operating system each visitor is using, (for example, Windows 10, Mac OS X), the domain name of each visitor’s Internet service provider (for example, AT&amp;T, Charter, Comcast, Cox, Time Warner, Verizon), the visitor’s IP address and/or device ID, the address (or “<b><i>URL</i></b>”) of the web site that the visitor came from before visiting the Web Site, which pages were visited on the Web Site, what was clicked on, and certain other available information. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet, which our web servers use to identify where to send the information your computer requests. When you request pages from the Web Site, our servers log your IP address as well as information about your activities on those pages.</p><p>To collect this Web Site Usage Information, the Web Site and any e-mails sent to you by the Web Site (or otherwise by Equity) may utilize <b>cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts</b> or other tracking technologies now and hereafter devised (“<b><i>Tracking Technologies</i></b>”).</p><p><b><i>Cookies</i></b>.  A cookie is a data file placed on a device when it is used to visit the Web Site.  A Flash cookie (or locally shared object) is a data file placed on a device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your device.  HTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage.  To identify local shared objects on your computer and adjust your settings, please visit: <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html" target="_new">www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html</a>.</p><p><b><i>Web Beacons</i></b>.  Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1x1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs,” “Pixel Tags,” or “Web Bugs”) may be included in our Web Site’s pages and messages.  Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or e-mail can act as a web beacon.  Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Web Site, to monitor how users navigate the Web Site, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed. </p> <p><b><i>Embedded Scripts</i></b>.  An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Web Site, such as the links you click on.  The code is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Web Site, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.  </p><p><b><i>Browser Fingerprinting</i></b>.  Collection and analysis of information from your device, such as, without limitation, your operating system, plug-ins, system fonts and other data, for purposes of identification.  </p><p><b><i>ETag, or Entity Tag</i></b>.  A feature of the cache in browsers.  It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL.  If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned.  Used in this manner ETags are a form of UID.  ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash, and/or HTML5 cookies. </p> <p><b><i>Recognition Technologies</i></b>.  Technologies, including application of statistical probability to data sets, which attempt to recognize or make assumptions about users and devices (e.g., that a user of multiple devices is the same user or household).</p><p>In addition, third parties may use Tracking Technologies in connection with the Web Site, which may include the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services.  We may not control those Tracking Technologies and we are not responsible for them.  However, you consent to potentially encountering third party Tracking Technologies in connection with use of our Web Site and accept that our statements under this Privacy Policy regarding our practices do not apply to the Tracking Technologies or practices of such third parties. </p> <p>Also, various third parties are developing or have developed signals or other mechanisms known as “do not track signals”.  For instance, some browsers may have such signal options, though they differ as to if the signal is set as default or must be turned on by the user.  Further, there is not yet an industry consensus as to what site and app operators should do with regard to these signals.  Accordingly, we do not monitor or take any action with respect to these signals or other mechanisms, though we may consider doing so if an understandable and practical standard is developed and widely adopted.  </p><p>Some third parties may offer you certain choices regarding their Tracking Technologies practices associated with our Web Site.  For example, you can find information on choices regarding analytics and interest-based advertising is <a href="#6">Section 6</a> below.  We are not responsible for the effectiveness of or compliance with any third parties’ opt-out or other choice options.  One way to potentially identify Tracking Technologies  on our Web Site is to add the free Ghostery plug-in to your browser (<a href="http://www.ghostery.com" target="_new">www.ghostery.com</a>), which according to Ghostery will display for you traditional, browser-based cookies associated with the web sites (but not mobile apps) you visit and privacy and opt-out policies and options of the parties operating those cookies.  We are not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this tool.  </p><h3 id="1.3">1.3 Offline Collection from You.</h3><p>Equity may also collect Personal Information from you through means other than the Web Site. This may include offline collection, such as when you submit a paper application to rent an apartment, make a rent payment by check, or call or visit the management office at an Equity property. It may also include e-mails that you send to us separate from the Web Site. This Privacy Policy does <b>not</b> apply to Personal Information that you provide to us through means other than the Web Site. However, to the extent we combine the Personal Information we collect from you outside of the Web Site with Personal Information that we collect through the Web Site, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information, unless specifically disclosed otherwise.</p><h3 id="1.4">1.4 Information Collected from Other Sources.</h3><p>We may receive Personal Information about you from other sources. For example, if you are applying for an apartment, condo, corporate housing, or employment, either via the Web Site or offline, we may obtain information from third parties about your creditworthiness, among other information, as part of the application process. This Privacy Policy does <b>not</b> apply to Personal Information about you that we receive from other sources. However, we may combine the information we receive from these other sources with Personal Information we collect through the Web Site. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information, unless specifically disclosed otherwise.</p><h3 id="1.5">1.5 Children.</h3><p>We are a general audience service and do not use the Web Site to knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of thirteen (13) that requires parental notice and consent under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“<b><i>COPPA</i></b>”) without such parental consent.  If you are a child under thirteen (13) years of age, you are not permitted to use the Web Site and should not send any information about yourself to us through the Web Site.  </p><p>In the event that we become aware that we have collected personal information from any child, we will dispose of that information, or otherwise treat it, in accordance with COPPA and other applicable laws and regulations.  If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your child under the age of thirteen (13) has provided us with personal information without COPPA-required consent, please contact us <a href="mailto:webmaster@eqrworld.com" class="generalbodylink">here</a>.</p><p>California minors should see <a href="#5.2">Section 5.2</a> regarding requests to remove content they have posted.</p><p><a href="#toc">Return to Table of Contents</a></p><h2 id="2">2. Use of Personal Information.</h2><p>We retain and use Personal Information to: (1) provide you with services or process transactions that you have requested; (2) communicate with you regarding information, features or offers that we believe will be of interest to you; (3) respond to your questions or other requests; (4) contact you with regard to the Web Site; (5) process or communicate with you about applications, payments or changes to your account information; (6) process other information or Personal Information that you submit through the Web Site; (7) conduct user surveys; (8) contact you regarding a sweepstakes, contest or promotion in which you have participated, and (9) fulfill other purposes disclosed at the time you provide your Personal Information. We may also use the information you provide to improve the Web Site or Equity’s services, to customize your experience on the Web Site, to serve you specific content, or for any other purposes not inconsistent with this Privacy Policy or prohibited by applicable law.</p><p><a href="#toc">Return to Table of Contents</a></p><h2 id="3">3. Sharing of Personal Information with Third Parties.</h2><p>We do not share your Personal Information with third parties for those third parties’ (other than our affiliates) for such third parties’ own direct marketing purposes without your consent. We may share non-personally identifiable information, such as Web Site Usage Information or other aggregated user statistics, with third parties without restriction.   In addition, we may share your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy, in any manner in which you expressly consent via the Web Site, or in the following circumstances:</p><h3 id="3.1">3.1 Affiliated or Subsidiary Companies.</h3><p>We may share Personal Information with our affiliated or subsidiary companies who require access to Personal Information for business purposes related to your tenancy or to process any application, request, inquiry, or other information or Personal Information you submit via the Web Site, and for our affiliates’ own marketing purposes. This includes the owner of any community where you make application or where you lease, as well as the management company for such community.</p><h3 id="3.2">3.2 Third parties providing services on our behalf.</h3><p>We may share your Personal Information with third parties who perform services on our behalf or on behalf of the owner of one of our properties, or give them access to collect it. This includes, without limitation, third parties that send communications, process payments, analyze data, assist with utility billing or renters insurance, provide credit checks, resident screening, or collection services, provide marketing assistance, or create, host and/or provide customer service on our behalf. These third parties may have access to Personal information in order to provide these services to us or on our behalf.  These third parties may also receive, or be given access to collect, Web Site Usage Information and other non-Personal Information for their own use.</p><h3 id="3.3">3.3 Legal Requirements and Law Enforcement.</h3><p>We may disclose Personal Information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it; at the request of governmental authorities conducting an audit or investigation (except as prohibited by applicable law); pursuant to a court order, subpoena, or discovery request in litigation; to verify or enforce compliance with our Terms of Use or other agreements or policies governing the Web Site and applicable laws, rules, and regulations; or whenever we believe disclosure is necessary to limit our legal liability or to protect or enforce the rights, interests, or safety of the Web Site, its users or other third parties. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we, in good faith, believe to be unlawful.</p><h3 id="3.4">3.4 Sweepstakes and Promotions.</h3><p>If you choose to enter a sweepstakes, contest or other promotion, your personal information may be disclosed to third parties in connection with the administration of such promotion, including, without limitation, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law, such as on a winners list. Also, by entering a promotion, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you, including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor(s) of the promotion to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising or marketing associated with the promotion.</p><h3 id="3.5">3.5 Corporate Change.</h3><p>We reserve the right to disclose and transfer your Personal Information in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, financing, sale of substantially all assets, or other corporate change, including for transaction due diligence. For instance, when a potential buyer is interested in purchasing one of our properties, we may provide the potential buyer with information about the property and the tenants who live there, which may include your Personal Information. Upon the sale of the property in which you live, all of your Personal Information may be transferred to the purchaser.</p><h3 id="3.6">3.6 Equal Employment Opportunity Reporting.</h3><p>In conjunction with laws and regulations enforced by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“<b><i>EEOC</i></b>”), the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (“<b><i>OFCCP</i></b>”) and similar state and local regulatory agencies, we may ask you to provide us with self-identifying information (such as veteran status, gender and ethnicity).  Providing such self-identifying information is voluntary, but if you do provide us with such information, we may submit that information, to the EEOC, the OFCCP and similar state and local regulatory agencies or otherwise use or disclose it for business-related purposes, including, without limitation, responding to information requests, fulfilling regulatory reporting requirements and defending against employment related complaints.</p><p><a href="#toc">Return to Table of Contents</a></p><h2 id="4">4. Non-Personal Information.</h2><p>We may share non-Personal Information, such as aggregated user statistics, with third parties.  If we de-identify data about you, it is not treated as Personal Information by us, and we may share it with others freely.  Except where prohibited by applicable law, we may share your Unique IDs with third parties along with data (other than Personal Information) related to you and your activities as non-Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.</p><p><a href="#toc">Return to Table of Contents</a></p><h2 id="5">5. California and Connecticut Residents.</h2><h3 id="5.1">5.1 Your California Privacy Rights.</h3><p>We may from time to time elect to share certain information about you collected by us on the Web Site with our affiliates for their own direct marketing purposes.  We will not, however, share your personal information with third parties other than our affiliates for their direct marketing purposes without your consent.  California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents who have supplied personal information, as defined in the statute, to us, under certain circumstances, to request and obtain certain information regarding our disclosure, if any, of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.  If this applies, you may obtain the categories of personal information shared and the names and addresses of all third parties that received personal information for their direct marketing purposes during the immediately prior calendar year (e.g. requests made in 2015 will receive information about 2014 sharing activities).  To make such a request, please provide sufficient information for us to determine if this applies to you, attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for our response.  You may make this request in writing at: Equity Residential, Two North Riverside Plaza, Chicago, IL 60606 (Attn:  Legal Dept. – CA Privacy Request).  Any such request must include “California Privacy Rights Request” in the first line of the description and include your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code.  Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this e-mail address or mail address.  </p><h3 id="5.2">5.2 California Minors.</h3><p>Any California residents under the age of eighteen (18) who have registered to use the Web Site, and who have posted content or information on the Web Site, can request that such information be removed from the Web Site by contacting us as set forth in <a href="#13">Section 13</a> below.  When making such a request, the minor must state that the minor personally posted such content or information and detail where the content or information is posted. We will make reasonable good faith efforts to remove the post from prospective public view or anonymize it so the minor cannot be individually identified. This removal process cannot ensure complete or comprehensive removal. For instance, third-parties may have republished the post and archived copies of it may be stored by search engines and others that we do not control.</p><h3 id="5.3">5.3 Connecticut Residents.</h3><p>Connecticut law requires any person or entity that collects Social Security numbers from Connecticut residents in the course of business to create a privacy protection policy and to publish or display it publicly.  It is our policy to protect the confidentiality of Social Security numbers in our possession from misuse and improper disclosure by maintaining and enforcing policies and physical and electronic safeguards against misuse and improper disclosure.  Unlawful disclosure of Social Security numbers is prohibited, and access to them is limited to personnel who need access to such information in order to perform their job functions.</p><p><a href="#toc">Return to Table of Contents</a></p><h2 id="6">6. Exercising Choices Regarding Analytics and Advertising.</h2><p>Equity may use Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics or other web site providers for analytics services.  These analytics services may use cookies and other Tracking Technologies to help Equity analyze how users use the Web Site.  Information generated by these services (e.g., your IP address and other Usage Information) may be transmitted to and stored by Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics and other web site providers on servers in the U.S. (or elsewhere) and these web site providers may use this information for purposes such as evaluating your use of the Web Site, compiling statistic reports on the Web Site’s activity, and providing other services relating to Web Site activity and other Internet usage.  Equity only retains aggregated data from Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics.  You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Google Analytics by going to <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_new">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a> or downloading the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.  You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Adobe Analytics by going to <a href="http://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html" target="_new">http://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html</a> under the section labeled "Tell our customers not to measure your use of their websites or tailor their online ads for you." </p><p>Equity may engage and work with third parties to serve advertisements on Equity’s behalf on the Web Site, and/or on Third Party Services, and to provide analytics about the performance of Equity’s ads.  Some information about your browsing of the Web Site and certain Third Party Services may be collected across time and services and shared with third parties to deliver ads and/or other content to you on the Web Site and certain Third Party Services. Equity may receive information about Third Party Services that you have visited and use it for marketing purposes—a practice sometimes termed “(re)-targeting,” “interest-based advertising,” and “online behavioral advertising” (collectively, “<b><i>Interest-based Ads</i></b>”).  We may participate in online advertising networks and exchanges that display Interest-based Ads to you on Third Party Services.  These entities may use cookies and other Tracking Technologies to automatically collect information about you and your activities, such as registering a unique identifier for your device and tying that to your online activities on and off of the Web Site.  </p><p>Certain companies we work with to serve Interest-based Ads participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance ("<b><i>DAA</i></b>") AdChoices Program and may display an Advertising Option Icon for Interest-based Ads on the ads that links to an opt-out tool which allows you to exercise certain choices regarding targeting.  You can learn more about the DAA AdChoices Program at <a href="http://www.youradchoices.com/" target="_new">http://www.youradchoices.com/</a> and its opt-out program for mobile apps at <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices" target="_new">http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices</a>.  In addition, certain advertising networks and exchanges we work with to serve Interest-based Ads may participate in the Network Advertising Initiative (“<b><i>NAI</i></b>”). NAI has developed a tool that allows consumers to opt out of certain Interest-based Ads delivered by NAI members' ad networks. To learn more about opting out of such targeted advertising or to use the NAI tool, see <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" target="_new">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a>.  Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Ads, you will continue to receive non-targeted ads.  Further, opting out of one or more NAI or DAA members only means that those selected members should no longer under the DAA / NAI rules deliver certain targeted ads to you. This selective opting out will affect this Web Site and other services, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks).
