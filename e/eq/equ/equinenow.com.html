			<p>We secure the Personal Information you provide on computer servers within an infrastructure that puts strong safeguards
				in place to help protect customer privacy. All data is stored in data centers with a highly secure, controlled environment.
				When sensitive Personal Information (such as a credit card number and/or geo-location data) is collected on our Websites
				and/or transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
				protocol. In addition, some areas of the Websites are inaccessible unless you login using a username or email address, and your
				password. Also, we do not store your complete credit card number or card code on our servers.</p>

			<h3>How You Can Access, Correct or Remove Your Information</h3>

			<p>You can access your Personal Information that we store by logging into your account through our Websites. Please be certain
				that you are logging in through our Websites and not through a “phishing” website masquerading as our Websites. Doing so will
				allow the phishing website to know your login credentials and then gain access to your account on our Websites. If you have
				forgotten your password, there is a password reset link on the login page. Once you are logged in, you will be able to correct
				any information that we store on your account dashboard page. </p>

			<p>If you would like to have your account and Personal Information deleted, please contact us at support@equinenow.com, or by mail
				at EquineNow.com, LLC, 345 S. Coast Highway Ste M2, Encinitas, CA 92024.</p>

			<h3>Retention of Personal Information</h3>

			<p>We retain Personal Information that you provide us as long as we consider it potentially useful in contacting you about our
				services. We also may retain your Personal Information as needed to comply with legal obligations or resolve disputes. We may
				retain user contribution or other system log files indefinitely that might be linked to your Personal information.</p>

			<h3>Changes to our Privacy Policy</h3>

			<p>We will post any changes we make to our privacy policy on this page and they will go into effect immediately upon posting.</p>

			<h3>Contact Us</h3>

			<p>Should you have other questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please send us an email to support@equinenow.com.</p>
