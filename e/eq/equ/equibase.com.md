Monthly account billing will continue until the visitor notifies Equibase Company in writing or if the monthly billing process fails, at which time billing for all future purchases will be processed at the time of purchase.

We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.
