## PRIVACY POLICY

Equinix and its affiliated companies globally are committed to respecting your online privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that you share with us. Personal Information is information that enables us to identify you, such as your email address, name, title and address. Equinix uses your Personal Information in order to personalize your experience on our Web site and also to be able to selectively send you communications that may be of interest to you, either electronically or otherwise. Our privacy policy governs the following areas:

### Disclosure

Equinix does not share presently information with other companies other than its own associates, and does not sell its user information. However, we reserve the right to use any personal information we collect for such purposes as customer service, marketing, product and service development, dissemination of investor information, recruiting and facilitating subsequent use of this Web site.

Unless you opt out of receiving promotional materials, we may from time to time notify you of special promotions, new products or services, or other information that may interest you. We explicitly reserve the right to disclose any such personal information if required to do so by law, or in the good faith belief that such action is reasonably necessary to comply with applicable law, or protect the rights, property or safety of Equinix, its employees, customers, or the public.

### Choice

### Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

Some of our Web pages utilize "cookies" and other tracking technologies. A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Some parts of Equinix’s Web site use cookies to track user traffic patterns. We do this in order to determine the usefulness of Equinix’s information to our users and to see how effective our navigational structure is in helping users reach that information. Equinix does not correlate this information with data about individual users, nor does it share this information or sell it to any third party

You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but please note that if you choose to erase or block your cookies, you will need to re-enter your original user ID and password to gain access to certain parts of the Web site.

Tracking technologies may record information such as Internet domain and host names; Internet protocol (IP) addresses; browser software and operating system types; clickstream patterns; and dates and times that our site is accessed. Our use of cookies and other tracking technologies allows us to improve our Web site and your Web experience. We may also analyze information that does not contain Personal Information for trends and statistics.
