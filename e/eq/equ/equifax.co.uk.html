                    <p><strong>What is a cookie?</strong></p>
                    <p>Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your device when you
visit a website. A device can refer to a computer, smartphone or tablet. Cookies are then sent back to the
originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognises that cookie. Cookies are
useful because they allow a website to recognise a user’s device. You can find more information about cookies
at: <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a> and <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu" target="_blank">http://www.youronlinechoices.eu</a>. For a video about cookies visit
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR-xtJVq7E" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR-xtJVq7E</a> Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your
preferences, and generally improve the user experience. They can also help to ensure that adverts you see
online are more relevant to you and your interests.</p>
                    <p><strong>How  we use cookies</strong></p>
                    <p>The cookies used on this website have been categorised based on the categories found in the ICC UK Cookie
guide. A list of all the cookies used on this website, by category, is set out below.</p>
                    <h3>Category  1: Strictly necessary cookies – These cookies enable services you have  specifically asked for.</h3>
                    <p>These
cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features, such as accessing
secure areas of the website. Without these cookies services you have asked for, like shopping baskets, cannot
be provided.</p>
                    <h3>Category  2: Performance cookies – These cookies collect anonymous information on the  pages visited.</h3>
                    <p>These
cookies collect information about how visitors use the website, for instance which pages visitors go to most
often, and if they get error messages from web pages. These cookies don’t collect information that identifies a
visitor. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve
how a website works.</p>
                    <p><strong>An example of a performance cookie we use is: </strong></p>
                    <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

                                <p><strong>Google Analytics</strong></p>
                            </td>

                                <p>We use Google Analytics to give us insight into how our users interact with the website.

visitors to the website, where they have come to the site from and the pages they have
visited. More information can be found at: <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html">http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html</a></p>

                    </tbody></table>
                    <h3>Category 3: Functionality cookies – These cookies remember  choices you make to improve your experience.</h3>
                    <p>These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make (such as your user name or the
region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. These cookies can also be used to
remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can
customise. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for such as watching a video.

                    <h3>Category 4: Targeting cookies or advertising cookies – These  cookies collect information about your browsing habits in order to make  advertising relevant to you and your interests.</h3>
                    <p>These are usually third party cookies (see section below) used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and your
interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure
the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They are usually placed by advertising networks with the
website operator’s permission. They remember that you have visited the website and this information is
shared with other organisations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising cookies will be linked
to site functionality provided by the other organisation.</p>
                    <p><strong>How  to manage cookies</strong></p>
                    <p>Most web browsers automatically accept cookies. However you do not have to accept cookies and you can,
should you choose at any time, reject or block the use of cookies and delete all cookies currently stored on
