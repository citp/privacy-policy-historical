# EY privacy statement - EY - Global

EY refers to the global organization, and may refer to one or more, of the member firms of Ernst & Young Global Limited, each of which is a separate legal entity. The data controller collecting and processing the personal information provided by a visitor to ey.com (“Our Site”) is the EY member firm in the visitor’s country or another EY member firm to which the visitor has submitted their personal information.

This statement, set forth below, is our privacy statement for the global organization of EY member firms and other entities within EY. Here we describe the practices we follow to respect the privacy of all visitors to Our Site.

In this statement, personal information means data which relates to an individual and which identifies that individual, either directly or indirectly, such as your name or your contact information.

If you have any questions regarding the processing of your personal information, please [contact us](mailto:global.data.protection@ey.com) or your usual EY representative.

**Collection, use, disclosure, choice**  
Registration is not required for you to use Our Site. If you are merely a visitor, we do not collect any personal information about you, except to the limited extent through the use of cookies, which are described below. However, there may be circumstances in which you choose to register and receive ongoing updates from EY. In these cases, EY may contact registrants to invite them to special events, provide them with information about our services, publications and products, or for other marketing purposes.

For example, you may choose to register for:

  1. **Email alerts**  
EY offers an email alert service to site visitors, in which we send subscribers email updates when new information is added to Our Site. If you decide to subscribe, we will collect basic contact information about you, such as your name and email address.
  2. **Expressing an interest in working for EY**  
Our Site enables you to register your interest in working for us or applying for an advertised vacancy. For more detail about the recruitment process and the information required, visit the careers section of Our Site.
  3. **Thought Center Webcasts**  
To view an EY Thought Center Webcast (live or archived), registration is required. When you register, you may be asked for personal information (name, contact information, etc.). The type of information collected will vary. At the time of registration, you are also asked whether or not you are a client of EY, and whether or not you would like to be informed of upcoming webcasts via Thought Center Webcast email alerts.

Your information is required in order to view any webcast. At the time of registration, you can check a box to automate the log-in process, which allows you to be automatically logged on upon your return to the EY Thought Center Webcast section when using the same computer. We use registration information for internal research and analysis purposes to help us understand who is viewing our webcasts, and become better equipped to serve your needs.

If you are interested in Thought Center Webcasts, but you do not wish to provide any personally identifiable information, you can read the executive summaries ("webcast recaps") posted on Our Site, which require no registration.

  4. **Surveys**  
EY may conduct surveys via Our Site. Survey participants may be asked for personal information (name, contact information, etc.) in addition to opinions or feedback. The type of information collected in surveys will vary.
  5. **Thought leadership registration**  
EY occasionally requires registration in exchange for our thought leadership: white papers, articles, studies, reports, survey analyses, booklets, etc. Your personal information may be requested in registration forms and the type of information collected from you will vary. EY reserves the right to distribute certain thought leadership materials only to those who supply the requested information.
  6. **Event registration**  
EY facilitates event registration via Our Site or, at times, via third party web sites. Personal information may be collected via event registration forms and the type of information collected will vary. EY may share registrant information with third parties in association with the event.

Examples of "third parties" include hotels, sponsors or co-sponsors, promoters, event organizers (including via third party web sites), speakers, panelists, etc. Please check the details provided at individual events to understand fully how your information will be used and retained.

  7. **Entrepreneur Of The Year** **®**  
EY accepts nominations for the EY Entrepreneur of the Year program via Our Site. Personal information, including financial data, is required of the nominee, and the nominee must sign the nomination form. Nomination forms are provided to the program sponsors and independent national and regional panels of judges in order to select award recipients.

Further, some of the information on the nomination form may be used for research, educational, or any other purpose, but we will not divulge the personal identity of the nominee or the identity of the nominee's company to any person other than the sponsors, the judges, and their respective affiliates.

Nominees must consent to this usage in order to participate in the nomination process. The nominator may include their own personal information on the form, however, this may not always be required. If nominator information is supplied, it is subject to the same terms as nominee information. For full details please refer to the information provided by the EY Entrepreneur of the Year program materials.

  8. **EY Alumni**  
Any personal information that an alumnus submits to EY will only be used to maintain contact with that alumnus, and will not be disclosed to any third party without the individual’s express permission.
  9. **EY Client Portal**  
If you have been given access rights to EY Client Portal by your EY contact, we would recommend you take note of the full privacy notice associated with this service. You will have access to the notice once you log onto EY Client Portal.



Information collected at registration is protected using industry-standard encryption technology as it is sent over the Internet.

Please refer to the specific privacy statements on the careers site of Our Site, the event registration sites, the EY Alumni portal as well as the EY Client Portal for the applicable retention periods for these initiatives.

If you have opted out for receiving future EY publications, your contact details will remain on our opt-out list to prevent that you receive any further publications from EY.

**Special categories of personal data**  
EY does not intentionally collect any special categories of personal data (sensitive personal information) via Our Site unless in a specific country we are legally required to do so, for example, for recruitment purposes. Sensitive personal information includes: information revealing racial or ethnic origin; political opinions; religious or philosophical beliefs; trade-union membership; the processing of genetic or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person; information concerning health; information concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation; and in some cases, social security numbers or financial information.

**Security**  
EY works to protect the confidentiality and security of information it obtains in the course of its business. Access to such information is limited and policies and procedures are in place, designed to safeguard the information from loss, misuse and improper disclosure.

**Disclosure**  
EY may only disclose your personal information outside of EY:

  * Where the disclosure is necessary to fulfill your request and involves a third party organization with which EY has a relationship (see “Third Party Links” below); or
  * When explicitly requested by you, the site visitor; or
  * As required by a court order or any other legal or regulatory requirement; or
  * Where the disclosure is reasonably related to the sale or other disposition of all or part of our business.



EY may use external service providers to assist with, for example, information technology and other administrative support services to operate Our Site.

**Transfer of personal information**  
EY has a comprehensive global privacy compliance program that includes EU-approved Binding Corporate Rules as well as certification to the EU-US Privacy Shield and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Please see EY’s [Binding Corporate Rules page](https://www.ey.com/gl/en/home/ey-data-protection-binding-corporate-rules-program) for more information on our Binding Corporate Rules, and [EY’s Privacy Shield Notice](http://www.ey.com/us/en/home/ey-privacy-shield-data-privacy-statement) for more information on how EY complies with the Privacy Shield program. EY will only disclose your personal information to third parties that have agreed in writing to provide an adequate level of privacy protection.

**Controlling your personal information**  
EY does not collect or compile personal information obtained by Our Site for dissemination or sale to outside parties for consumer marketing purposes or host mailings on behalf of third parties.

You are legally entitled to request details of the personal information we are holding about you. EY provides you the ability to keep your personal information accurate and up-to-date. If at any time you would like EY to rectify, erase or restrict the processing of your personal information, or you would like to obtain confirmation whether or not your personal information is processed by EY, access your personal information, exercise your right to data portability or withdraw your consent to processing, please [contact us](mailto:global.data.protection@ey.com).

**Third-party links**  
Please be aware that ey.com sometimes contains links to other sites that are not governed by this privacy statement. Visitors to Our Site may be directed to third-party sites for more information, such as about our thought leadership, events, content sponsorships, vendor services, government entities, non-profits, and social networks.

EY makes no representations or warranties regarding how your information is stored or used on third-party servers. We recommend that you review the privacy statement of each third-party site linked from Our Site to determine their use of your personal information.

**Cookies and Web Beacons**  
Our Site uses cookies, Web Beacons and other web technologies such as CAPTCHA’s to improve Our Site’s performance and to enhance your browsing experience. Certain areas of Our Site also use cookies to understand more about you, so we can offer you a more personalized browsing experience.

**_What is a cookie?_**  
A "cookie" is technology that allows Our Site to store tokens of information (an 'identifier') in your browser used only by Our Site while you are on Our Site. Cookies are not used to determine the personal identity of anyone who is merely visiting Our Site. They serve to help us track traffic patterns to determine a user’s preferred location and language so that we can direct them to the correct country home page when they visit Our Site.

Cookies have other uses as well. For example, in the Thought Center Webcast section ("Webcast Section"), they are used to provide entry for subscribers who have chosen the automatic log-on feature during registration. Cookies are also used to prevent online poll participants from voting more than once.

On certain pages of Our Site, cookies are used to help us track your interests while you browse the internet, so we can tailor more relevant advertising to you, and to understand what is important to you.

**_How do I disable cookies?_**  
If you do not want to receive a cookie from Our Site or the Webcast Section, you have the option of setting your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, so that you may determine whether to accept it or not. However, please be aware that if you do turn off 'cookies' in your browser, you will not be able to fully experience some of Our Sites. For example, you will not be able to benefit from automatic log-on and other personalization features of the Webcast Section.

**_What cookies do we use?_**  
The cookies used by Our Site perform four functions, as classified below:

  1. _Essential/Strictly Necessary Cookies_  
Some cookies we use are essential to the functioning of Our Site. For example, remembering your log-in details to certain parts of Our Site.
  2. _Performance Cookies_  
Some cookies help us with the performance and design of Our Site. This allows us to measure how many times a page has been visited, whether a page has been visited on Our Site through an advertisement or by other means.
  3. _Functionality Cookies_  
Some cookies help us to remember your settings which you may have selected, or assist with other functionality when you browse and use Our Site. This helps us to remember what you have selected, so on your return visit we remember your preferences.
  4. _Targeting and Tracking Cookies_  
On certain pages of Our Site, we use cookies to help us understand your interests as you browse the internet, so we can tailor and deliver to you a more personalised service in the future. This assists us in delivering relevant advertising to you during various advertising campaigns we may run from time to time through participating third party sites.



These cookies collect information relating to the origin of your visit, where you were exposed to EY advertising, what advertising feature you saw, whether you arrived directly or indirectly to Our Site, the device you used to visit Our Site and which downloads you performed. This information is collected on an anonymous basis via third party suppliers.

In addition, we also utilize cookies on certain pages of Our Site to communicate with third party data suppliers in order to extrapolate your digital behaviour. This help us to understand and target more relevant advertising in the future. The information we receive is all aggregate and anonymous, but will include statistics such as demographics, online behaviour, product interests and lifestyle. Targeting and tracking cookies are provided via trusted third party suppliers. Should you require more information regarding our suppliers and how these cookies operate please [contact us](http://www.ey.com/gl/en/home/ernst---young---who-to-contact-at-ey).

**_What are Web Beacons?_**  
EY occasionally advertises on third party web sites. As part of our effort to track the success of our advertising campaigns, we may at times use a visitor identification technology such as "web beacons," or "action tags," which count visitors who have come to Our Site after being exposed to an EY banner ad on a third party site. We do not use this technology to access your personal information and it is only used to compile aggregated statistics about visitors who come to Our Site to gauge the effectiveness of our ads.

By navigating on Our Site, you agree that we can place cookie and web beacons on your computer or device. If you prefer not to receive cookies or web beacons, then you should stop using Our Site, or consult your browsing settings.

**Social Media Platforms**  
You may wish to participate in the various blogs, forums, wikis and other social media platforms hosted by EY (“Social Media Platforms") which we make available to you. The main aim of these Social Media Platforms is to facilitate and allow you to share content. However, EY cannot be held responsible if you share personal information on Social Media Platforms that is subsequently used, misused or otherwise appropriated by another user.

EY may also provide links to other social media platforms maintained on separate servers by individuals or organizations over which EY has no control. EY makes no representations or warranties regarding the accuracy or any other aspect of the information located on such servers.

A link to a third party’s website should not be construed as an endorsement by either EY or that third party of the other or its products and services. EY makes no representations or warranties regarding how user data is stored or used on third-party servers. We recommend reviewing the privacy statement of each third-party site linked from Our Site to determine their use of your personal information.

**Children**  
This website (Our Site) is not intended for use by children. We understand the importance of protecting children’s information, especially in an online environment, and we do not knowingly collect or maintain information about children.
