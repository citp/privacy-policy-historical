However, there may be circumstances in which you choose to register for ongoing updates from EY. In these cases, EY may contact registrants to invite them to special events, provide them with information about our services, publications and products, or for other marketing purposes.

 ** _Your Choice._** Ernst & Young gives you choices regarding the collection and usage of your personally identifiable information. To update any application or resume you have submitted, please apply again via the job search section, and re-submit your updated information. Due to volume, Ernst & Young cannot personally respond to individual requests for applicant status.

  * **Thought Center Webcast section.** To view an Ernst & Young Thought Center Webcast (live or archived), registration is required. When you register, you may be asked for personal information (name, contact information, etc.). The type of information collected will vary but could include data such as but not limited to your name, email and mailing addresses, country, industry, company, position and phone number. At the time of registration, you are also asked whether or not you are a client of Ernst & Young, and whether or not you would like to be informed of upcoming webcasts via Thought Center Webcast email alerts.

Your information is required in order to view any webcast. At the time of registration, you can check a box to automate the log-in process, which allows you to be automatically logged on when you return to the Ernst & Young Thought Center Webcast section using the same computer. We use registration information for internal research and analysis purposes only, to help us understand who is viewing our webcasts, and become better equipped to serve your needs.

**_Your Choice._** Ernst & Young gives you choices regarding the collection and usage of your personally identifiable information. If you have registered for Ernst & Young Thought Center Webcast Alerts, and do not wish to receive future emails, please open any Thought Center Webcast email you have received, and click the link (or copy and paste the URL) at the bottom of the email: "To remove yourself from the mailing list..." If you do not have an email to access this URL, please request to be removed from the email list through the ["update your profile"](http://webcast.ey.com/thoughtcenter/default.aspx) function, where you can also submit any changes to your personal profile.

Because we do not require a password to use the section, we do not allow you to directly view or change your personal profile. This is for your privacy and protection. Any requests we receive via the "update your personal profile" function will be verified via your email address, which means you must enter the same one you entered when first registering.

Some cookies we use are essential to the functioning of Our Site. For example, remembering your log-in details to certain parts of Our Site.

Some cookies help us to remember your settings which you may have selected, or assist with other functionality when you browse and use Our Site. This helps us to remember what you have selected, so on your return visit we remember your preferences.

  * _Targeting and Tracking Cookies_

On certain pages of Our Site, we use cookies to help us understand your interests as you browse the internet, so we can tailor and deliver to you a more personalized service in the future. This assists us in delivering relevant advertising to you during various advertising campaigns we may run from time to time through participating third party sites.




These cookies collect information relating to the origin of your visit, where you were exposed to EY advertising, what advertising feature you saw, whether you arrived directly or indirectly to Our Site, the device you used to visit Our Site and which downloads you performed. This information is collected on an anonymous basis via third party suppliers.

In addition, we also utilize cookies on certain pages of Our Site to communicate with third party data suppliers in order to extrapolate your digital behavior. This helps us to understand and target more relevant advertising in the future. The information we receive is all aggregate and anonymous, but will include statistics such as demographics, online behavior, product interests and lifestyle. Targeting and tracking cookies are provided via trusted third party suppliers. Should you require more information regarding our suppliers and how these cookies operate please [contact us](http://www.ey.com/US/en/Home/Home-ContactUs).

_Web Beacons._ Ernst & Young occasionally advertises on third party Web sites. As part of our effort to track the success of our advertising campaigns, we may at times use a visitor identification technology such as "web beacons," or "action tags," which count visitors who have come to ey.com after being exposed to an Ernst & Young banner ad on a third party site. We do not use this technology to access your personally identifiable information; it is only used to compile aggregated statistics about visitors who come to ey.com and to gauge the effectiveness of our ads.

**Social Media Platforms.**

You may wish to participate in the various blogs, forums, wikis and other social media platforms hosted by Ernst & Young (“Social Media Platforms"), which we make available to you. The main aim of these Social Media Platforms is to facilitate and allow you to share content. Ernst & Young cannot be held responsible if you share personal information on Social Media Platforms that is subsequently used, misused or otherwise appropriated by another user.

Ernst & Young may also provide links to other social media platforms maintained on separate servers by individuals or organizations over which Ernst & Young has no control. Ernst & Young makes no representations or warranties regarding the accuracy or any other aspect of the information located on such servers. A link to a third party’s website should not be construed as an endorsement by either Ernst & Young or that third party of the other or its products and services. Ernst & Young makes no representations or warranties regarding how user data is stored or used on third-party servers. We recommend reviewing the privacy policy of each third-party site linked from Our Site to determine their use of your personal data.

**Supplier Diversity Program.**

Ernst & Young identifies and works with small, minority- and women-owned businesses. Our procurement teams use a supplier diversity database when searching for qualified suppliers. Certified companies can register to join our database via our web site (www.ey.com/us/supplierdiversity). The type of information collected on the secure registration form is standard in the supplier diversity industry, and the required information on the form is necessary to become part of our database. This information enables Ernst & Young to make informed procurement decisions.

The registration form and the supplier database are maintained by a third party, who has agreed in writing to provide an adequate level of privacy protection for all Ernst & Young registrant data. If you have already registered, and would like to view or update your information, please log on to the site (a "Forgot Your Password?" feature is available there). If you have questions about our supplier diversity policies, please email the supplier diversity group.

Ernst & Young understands the importance of protecting children's privacy in the interactive, online world. Our Site does not intentionally target or solicit to children 13 and younger. Some of the firm's other online services may be designed to educate children on financial and other matters. These Ernst & Young sites are not governed by this privacy policy but will have their own privacy policies that more fully explain how they respect and protect the privacy of children while providing them valuable information, fun, and education.

**Accountability.**

Ernst & Young complies with applicable privacy regulations. Ernst & Young supports and is involved in consumer, government and industry efforts to identify and resolve privacy issues.
