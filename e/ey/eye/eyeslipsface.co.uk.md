Please note that if you voluntarily submit any personal information for posting on the Website, such as a review or a blog post, the information becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others, so you should use care before posting information about yourself online.

**Access to Your Personal Information**

You may access your personal information by signing into your account. From there, you can correct or modify your information. Please ensure that you keep your personal and contact details up to date by signing into your account and making changes when required.

**Security**

We maintain reasonable and appropriate measures designed to maintain information we collect in a secure manner. We have taken certain physical, electronic, and administrative steps to safeguard and secure the information we collect from Website visitors.

Even though we follow reasonable procedures to try to protect the information in our possession, no security system is perfect and we cannot promise, and you should not expect, that your information will be secure in all circumstances. The transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure; this risk is common across the internet and not specific to our Website. We cannot guarantee the security of your data (including your personal information) transmitted to our Website; any transmission is at your own risk.

It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computing device. Be sure to sign off and close your browser when you have finished your user session. This will help to ensure that others do not access your personal information if you share your computing device or use a computing device in a public place such as a library or internet café.

**Children**

We do not direct the Website to, nor do we knowingly collect any personal information from, children under the age of thirteen. In accordance with our terms and conditions of sale you must be at least eighteen years of age to order products from the Website.

**Third Party Websites**

The Website may contain links to third-party websites, such as social media sites like Facebook and Twitter, which may have privacy policies that differ from our own. We are not responsible for the activities and practices that take place on these sites. Accordingly, we recommend that you review the privacy policy posted on any external site before disclosing any personal information. Please contact those websites directly if you have any questions about their privacy policies.

**Interest Based Advertising**

We may use third-party advertising companies that use tracking technologies to serve our advertisements across the Internet. These companies may collect anonymous information about your visits to the Website and other websites and your interaction with our advertising and other communications. These advertising companies serve ads on behalf of us and others on non-affiliated sites, and some of those ads may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on information collected about your visits to this site and elsewhere over time. Other companies may also use such technology to advertise on our Website.
