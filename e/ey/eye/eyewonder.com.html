  <h1>EYEWONDER :: Privacy </h1>
  <p>EyeWonder, LLC ("EyeWonder") is committed to protecting on-line privacy for its users, advertisers, portals, networks and publishers. Below is EyeWonder's policy on collecting, using, disclosing, maintaining, and protecting the information that it receives through EyeWonder®-powered advertisements or through its World Wide Web site (the "Site").</p>
  <h2>Data Collection of Information Received through EyeWonder®-powered Advertisements</h2>
  <p>In the course of delivering an advertisement to a user, EyeWonder does not collect personally identifiable information such as name, address, phone number, or email address. However, EyeWonder does collect certain non-personally identifiable information about users, such as the server into which a computer is logged, whether and how a user responded to the advertisement delivered, the type of computer operating system used, and browser type. The non-personally identifiable information that is collected is used for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring the effectiveness of ads on behalf of advertisers and Web publishers.</p>
  <p>When an EyeWonder®-powered advertisement is received on a computer or other electronic device, EyeWonder utilizes techniques to determine whether that device has previously received the advertisement, as well as techniques to evaluate the user's interaction with the advertisement (including any information voluntarily provided by the user in surveys or otherwise). Such information is used to avoid sending repetitive advertising to the user, to customize subsequent advertising to enhance the user's experience, to comport with the user's habits or preferences, and sometimes to measure the effectiveness of the advertisement.</p>
  <p>From time to time, advertisers, publishers or portals request that EyeWonder assist in the collection of information voluntarily supplied by users in connection with an EyeWonder®-powered advertisement, or a user's interaction with such an advertisement, which may include personal information such as name, address, phone number, or email address.  This information is provided directly to the advertiser, publisher, network, and/or portal, and is not used independently by EyeWonder. EyeWonder is not responsible for the advertisers' use of this voluntarily supplied information and EyeWonder is informed that this information is to be used by the advertiser, publisher, network, and/or portal, in accordance with their own particular privacy policy. However, EyeWonder cannot control the use of such information by any such advertiser, publisher, network and/or portal, and is not responsible for their use of such information.</p>
  <p>Additionally information (including personally identifying information) supplied by users for use by a third party's services (such as that provided for SMS services) is provided directly to the third party, and is not stored by either EyeWonder or the publisher's site on which the advertisement is displayed. This information is used solely for the purpose that is identified by the third party within the advertisement in which the data is being supplied or as established within that third party's privacy policy.</p>
  <p>EyeWonder may occasionally disclose information that it collects if required to do so by law or in the good–faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and/or federal laws or to respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, warrant, or legal process in the manner required by the requesting entity.</p>
  <h2>Cookies</h2>
  <p>As most Internet sites do, EyeWonder may use "cookies" or "scripts" to enhance a user's experience on the Internet.  A cookie is a piece of text stored by a user's web browser and contains a unique number that is assigned to a browser the first time an EyeWonder®-powered advertisement is served.  This number is stored on the user's computer and helps deliver advertisements which are not repetitive and may be more relevant to the user.  This number cannot be transferred to another browser, cannot be related to a specific person, and does not contain viruses.  Additionally cookies may collect any of the non-personally identifiable information described above.</p>
  <p>Some Internet browsers can be adjusted to disable the use of cookies and scripts; however, some functionalities of an EyeWonder®-powered advertisement or the Site may not be available without the use of cookies and scripts.</p>
  <p>EyeWonder sets cookies to expire after eight weeks and the expiration date updates every time a user encounters the EyeWonder server.</p>
  <h2>Options</h2>
  <p>If a user would like to opt-out of the use of cookies that collect non-personally identifiable information, then the user can click on the Opt-Out link below.  If a user has opted-out and would like to opt-in, the user may click on the Opt-In link below.</p>
<form action="javascript:void(0);">
    <p>
      <input type="radio" onchange="document.getElementById('submit').disabled='';" name="action" value="optIn">
      Opt-In</p>
    <p>
      <input type="radio" onchange="document.getElementById('submit').disabled='';" name="action" value="optOut">
      Opt-Out</p>
    <input type="button" id="submit" onclick="setPrefs(this);" value="Save">
  </form>
  <p>Click "Save" to accept your settings.</p>
  <p><span id="info"></span></p>
  <p><span id="opt"></span></p>
  <p>Note that the Opt-out process provides an opt-out cookie to the browser.  Therefore, if cookies are disabled, erased, or altered, or browser or machine software is changed, then the results of this opt-out process may be undone and the user will need to opt-out again.</p>
  <h2>Data Collection from  Site</h2>
  <p>Information collected through the Site varies, depending on the sections of the Site visited and the information the visitor chooses to provide. For visitors to the public sections of the Site who read or download information, EyeWonder collects only non-personally identifiable information about the visit, including the IP address of the visitor's computer, the visitor's type of computer and operating system, the date and time of access, and the URL of the web site from which the visitor linked directly to the Site. EyeWonder does not collect any personally identifiable information from visitors who visit only the public sections of the Site. For visitors who contact EyeWonder via e-mail or who participate in an online survey, the information provided in the e-mail message or survey response is collected, including the visitor's e-mail address, and any questions or comments the visitor provides.</p>
  <p>Information that EyeWonder collects is used for its internal business purposes, including studying the use of the Site. If a question or comment is sent to EyeWonder by e-mail, EyeWonder uses the information therein to respond to the question or comment. EyeWonder also may use the information provided to it to send news and information that EyeWonder believes may be of interest. In addition, EyeWonder may disclose information concerning the Site and its visitors in an aggregate, non-personally identifiable form.</p>
  <p>EyeWonder uses industry-standard security measures to protect any information provided to it. However, EyeWonder cannot guarantee that submissions to the Site, or that any content residing on or transmissions from, EyeWonder's servers will be completely secure.</p>
  <p>Any password-protected areas of the Site can be accessed only with a valid password. Each password owner is responsible for keeping the password secret and confidential, and for notifying EyeWonder if the password may have been stolen or might otherwise be misused.</p>
  <p>If a visitor has elected to receive from EyeWonder product updates, new product information, newsletters, or other marketing information, and would like to discontinue receiving these materials, send an email to tkim@eyewonder.com with “privacy policy opt-out” in the subject line.  Users should request the opt-out option.</p>
  <h2>Other Web Sites</h2>
  <p>This privacy statement applies solely to EyeWonder's technology and Site.  EyeWonder is not responsible for the privacy practices of advertisers, publishers, networks, portals, or other sites to which the Site may link.</p>
  <h2>Updates and Questions</h2>
  <p>Changes in EyeWonder's Privacy Policy may occur at any time.  Such changes will be communicated by publishing the modified Privacy Policy on the Site.  Please be sure to check for updates.  While changes may be made to the Privacy Policy, EyeWonder will not use personally identifiable information for any new purposes without user consent.</p>
