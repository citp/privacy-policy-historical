**Privacy Practices for Our Sizmek Website (www.sizmek.com)**

Sizmek Inc. and its subsidiaries ("Sizmek", "we" and "us") firmly believe in the importance of online privacy.  We do not collect any  information that enables us to determine your actual identity ("personal information") before, during or after your visit to this sizmek.com website or our regional sites accessible from this website, other than personal information you voluntarily supply to us (e.g. by submitting information through the “Contact Us” form).  When you provide personal information directly to us, this information is used by Sizmek solely for the purposes identified at the point you provide it. More information about opting out of our use of cookies on our websites is available in our [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/about-us/cookie).

**Privacy Practices for Advertising and Content Served by Sizmek**

We respect your right to privacy throughout all of the services we provide.  In particular, Sizmek is a member of the [Network Advertising Initiative (NAI)](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) and complies with the NAI Code of Conduct, including its requirements as to transparency, notice and user control. 

  [](https://privacy.truste.com/privacy-seal/Sizmek/validation?rid=08af43d7-c9ec-4d5c-9494-abd45c75788e "Validate TRUSTe privacy certification")

In addition, Sizmek adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising and the DAA Self-Regulatory Principles for Multi-Site Data, as well as the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance’s ("EDAA") principles.

**Data Collection through Sizmek Services**

Through our services, our customers – advertisers, advertising agencies, publishers, and other users – may collect and use information about you to provide you a more enriched online experience.   Sizmek’s innovative tools and services are used to create advertisements, to deliver advertisements to websites and mobile applications on behalf of advertisers, to monitor the success of and manage advertising campaigns, and to present you with advertisements that are more likely to be interesting and relevant to you.

To do this, Sizmek's technology is deployed on third party websites and mobile applications to collect information that may be used for online ad tailoring purposes or to deliver an advertisement to you from a company whose website or mobile application you have visited or whose advertisement you have viewed in the past.  Sizmek's technology employs cookies and similar technologies (like pixels and statistical device identifiers) to collect information about your browser or device, the sites it has visited, the advertisements served to it, interactions with those advertisements, and the approximate geographic location of the device's internet service provider ("behavioral information") in the course of providing our customers with ad-serving and campaign management services and for the purpose of helping our customers determine which advertisement is suitable to be delivered to you.  This behavioral information, which does not enable Sizmek to determine your actual identity, may be shared with our customers and Sizmek’s and our customers’ partners for their lawful advertising purposes.  

**Information Collected by Customers and their Partners  **

Please note that Sizmek customers sometimes include their own (or their partners') pixels or similar technologies within advertisements that Sizmek serves to websites, in order to set and read their own cookies which Sizmek does not control.  

In addition, if you visit a website or mobile application that uses Sizmek services, or click through an ad to the website or online service of one of our customers, those customers may collect additional information about your visit beyond the information described in this privacy policy. They may also allow other companies (such as other ad networks or web analytics services) to collect information through mechanisms such as cookies, pixels and similar technologies.

Sizmek is not responsible for and cannot control the data collection and use practices of its customers. You should read the privacy notices of the websites you visit and the online services and interactive ads that you use to understand what information companies collect and how they use that data.

**Sharing of Behavioral Information with Customers**

We share the behavioral information collected from ad-tags and Sizmek cookies with our customers and partners for their lawful advertising purposes. We may also share behavioral information with our customers’ service providers to enable them to provide services on our customers' behalf or to partner with us in selecting and serving ads for our customers. We use reasonable efforts to require our customers and partners to treat the behavioral information we share with them in accordance with applicable laws, the terms of the contracts we may have with them, and their own privacy policies, but cannot control their use of this information.

**Information Sizmek Collects on Behalf of Third Parties**

On occasion, at the request and on behalf of a customer, Sizmek may collect personal information supplied voluntarily by consumers through their interaction with data collection fields in the body of advertisements or on websites (such as name, email, etc.).  This personal information is provided directly to the customer on whose behalf the information was collected, or the customer’s service providers, and is processed by Sizmek only to the extent and as long as is necessary to provide the advertising services for which the personal information was collected.  Our customers are limited by contract to use this personal information solely for the purposes identified within the advertisement to provide consumers with requested goods, services, or information as established within that customer's privacy policy.  Sizmek is not responsible for its customers' use of this voluntarily supplied data.  Sizmek does not distribute this personal information to any party other than those indicated within the advertisement or, at the customers’ direction, their service providers. Sizmek never associates any of this personal information with any other data (such as behavioral information) gathered or used in the delivery of advertisements.

**Links to Other Sites**

Our site and the advertisements we serve on behalf of customers may contain links to other sites whose information practices may be different from ours.  In addition, there may be links to other sites provided within the body of advertisements on other websites.  We do not have control over the information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.  You should consult the privacy policy of these other sites to learn how your privacy is protected. 

**Data Security and Retention**

We have reasonable technical and organizational security measures in place to help protect the personal information that is collected through our web site or voluntarily submitted to us through interactions with advertisements we serve.  However, no system can be completely secure, and we make no guarantees as to the safety or security of any information transmitted to or from this site or through our services.  Sizmek will process cookie level data for up to 90 days from the last user interaction, after which it will no longer be processed. Anonymous log file data regarding user engagement with our ads will be stored for up to thirteen months, following which the log file data is deleted. 

**Our Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies**

_Cookies_

We use cookies to provide our website and also to deliver our advertising services to customers.  A cookie is a small text file that can be stored on your computer or device when you view an advertisement or website relating to one of our customers.  The cookie does not contain your name, address, phone number, email address, or anything that enables us to determine your actual identity.  Instead, Sizmek uses cookies to collect behavioral information such as a computer’s IP address, the type of the computer’s operating system, the type of internet browser software, what web pages were viewed and at what time.  Sizmek also uses cookies to collect demographic information collected through anonymous online surveys such as gender and age range, as well as information about your browsing activity for the purpose of delivering advertising based on preferences or interests known or inferred from the data collected. 

To learn more about the cookies we serve when you visit the Sizmek website (including how to opt-out of them), please visit our [Cookie Policy here](https://web.archive.org/about-us/cookie).  To learn how to opt-out of the cookies we serve when we provide advertising services to customers, please read the section "The Opt-Out Cookie & Your Choices" below.

_Log files_

Like most websites and advertising services providers, we gather certain information about your use of the Sizmek website and services automatically and store it in log files.  This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.  We use this information, which does not allow us to determine your actual identity, to analyze trends, to administer the site and services, to track users’ movements around the Sizmek website and the websites and mobile devices to which we provide advertisements, and to gather demographic information about our users who interact with our services as a whole.

_Pixels (also known as Clear Gifs)_

We or third parties may employ advertising pixels (a.k.a. clear gifs) on websites and advertisements that interact with some of our services.  Pixels help us and our customers better manage content and advertising on websites by informing us what content is effective.  Pixels are graphics embedded invisibly in web and advertising content and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Pixels work with cookies to record the interactions of users with websites and advertisements.  We do not tie the information gathered by pixels to users' personal information. 

_Statistical identifiers (also known as device recognition)_

We may employ a technique known as statistical identifiers (a.k.a. device recognition).  Like pixels, they help us and our customers to better manage content and advertising on websites and mobile devices by informing us (without using cookies) of the content with which users interact.  Statistical identifiers collect various information about your device, such as your screen resolution, browser type, operating system and so on.  Many devices have unique, or near unique, device profiles and so collecting this information enables us to determine to a reasonable level of statistical accuracy the level of users’ engagement with our or our customers' advertisements and websites and to recognize the devices of users who interact with our or our customers' content.  We do not tie the information gathered through the use of statistical identifiers to users’ personal information.  

**Opt-Out & Your Choices**

Sizmek allows consumers to opt-out of Sizmek using our ad-serving cookie and statistical identifiers to serve online ads tailored to the consumer’s interests. Refusing cookies or use of statistical identifiers does not stop advertisements from being served to your computer or device; rather, it means that Sizmek will not use cookie or statistical identifier data to serve targeted advertisements to you. Please note that if you choose to opt out, we will be unable to serve you ads tailored to your interests, and you may receive the same ad multiple times.

**Browser Opt-Out Methods  **

[Click here](http://ds.serving-sys.com/OBA/MediaMind/OptOut.aspx) (or in the opt-out box at the top of this page) for the Sizmek ad-serving cookie opt-out. This process will store an opt-out cookie in your browser, which allows us to recognize you as an opt-out user and respect your cookie and statistical identifiers preferences in future. The cookie will apply to the specific browser you are using; if you wish to opt out for other browsers or computers that you use, you must repeat the process using these browsers or computers.  All other cookies associated with your browser will remain intact and your opt-out will be effective with respect to the browser used as long as you do not delete the cookie file from your hard drive. Please note that if you erase all cookies from your computer, you will also erase our opt-out cookie and will need to repeat the process of opting out.  You may also opt out by [clicking here to visit the consumer opt out service of the NAI](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) or, if you are a visitor from the European Union,[ clicking here to visit the Your Online Choices websites](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/). If you’ve previously opted out, and would like to reverse your setting, [click here](http://ds.serving-sys.com/OBA/MediaMind/OptIn.aspx) to opt back in.

**Mobile Opt-Out Methods**

Mobile device system software offered by companies such as Apple and Google provide device-based opt out choices that are transmitted to companies providing cross-app advertising.  Mobile device browsers and applications also provide certain privacy controls. For information on those opt-out tools and privacy controls, please evaluate and review your device, mobile browser and application settings.

**Your Advertising Choices and Third Party Services**

Through our services and platform, our customers have access to services provided by third party companies with whom we have partnered to assist our customers in delivering more relevant ads to you. If you would like to learn more about the practices of some of the companies we have partnered with and to make choices about their use of your information, please click the following link to the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) [opt-out page here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp)  or the European Digital Advertising Alliance [opt-out page here](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/).  Some of our partners may not be covered by the NAI or EDAA programs, and you should consult the privacy policies on their websites for more information and to make choices about their services.

**Do Not Track Disclosure**

Do Not Track ("DNT") is a privacy preference that users may set in certain web browsers. DNT is intended to allow users another method of informing websites and services that they do not want certain information about their website visits collected over time and across websites.

At present, we respect DNT signals that we believe are the result of an active choice made by the user; however, we do not recognize or respond to DNT signals from browsers that turn these on by default.  Please note that the online service and advertising industries currently are still working toward defining what "DNT" means, and devising a common approach to responding to DNT, and we may therefore change our treatment of DNT signals once a common approach is agreed.

**Social Media Features**

Our website may include some social media features, such as the Facebook "Like" button, the Twitter "Tweet" button, the LinkedIn "Share" button and so on. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our website, and may set a cookie or employ similar technologies to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features are either hosted by a third party or directly on our website. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it, and you should consult their privacy policy for more information. 

**Information Relating to Children**

Our products and services are designed and intended for those 13 years of age and older. We do not knowingly collect personal information from persons under the age of 13 on the websites we operate or through our technology.  Please advise us if you are aware of our having received personal information from someone under 13, in which case we will take appropriate steps to delete it.

**Safe Harbor Compliance**

As a US-headquartered company, the information Sizmek collects will be processed in the United States of America.  While the USA does not have a comprehensive data privacy legal framework equivalent to those in European Union and Switzerland, Sizmek complies with the US-EU Safe Harbor Framework and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.  Sizmek has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.  To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view our certification page, please visit <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>.

In compliance with the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles, Sizmek commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information.  European Union or Swiss citizens with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact Sizmek at [Privacy-ProjectGroup@Sizmek.com](mailto:Privacy-ProjectGroup@Sizmek.com).

Sizmek has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints from EU and Swiss citizens or residents regarding transfers of their personal data under the Safe Harbor Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if Sizmek does not satisfactorily address your complaint, you may contact BBB EU SAFE HARBOR at [www.bbb.org/us/safe-harbor-complaints](http://www.bbb.org/us/safe-harbor-complaints).

**Your rights to access, update and delete personal information**

You can ask us for a copy of any personal information we hold about you at any time (which may be subject to a fee specified by law), to update or correct personal information which is inaccurate or incomplete, or to delete your personal information.  You can exercise these rights by contacting us using the details supplied under the heading "If You Have Questions About This Policy".

**Other Third Party Disclosures**

We disclose your personal information to service providers that support us to deliver services to you or to our customers, but ensure that such service providers are contractually required to protect your personal information at all times.

In addition, we may disclose your personal information where we consider it necessary to do so in order to respond to a request from law enforcement or governmental authorities, to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights, or to protect the vital interests of any person.  If we choose to sell all or a substantial part of our business or assets, then please note we may also disclose your personal information to the third party buyer that acquires our business or its assets.

**Changes to this Document**

Sizmek reserves the right to change, modify, add or remove portions of this policy at any time and without notice, provided that any such changes do not materially adversely affect you. If we change our privacy policy, we will make every effort to post notice of those changes in this area so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.

If we make any material changes to this policy we will notify you by e-mail (where we have this) or by means of a prominent notice on the Sizmek website prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to review this page periodically for the latest information on our privacy practices.

**If You Have Questions About This Policy**
