TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. Because this web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. By displaying the TRUSTe trustmark, this web site has agreed to notify you of: 

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact the Eyeglasses.com, Inc.'s Privacy Protection Group by sending email to [privacy@eyeglasses.com](mailto:privacy@eyeglasses.com).

Eyeglasses.com, Inc., the owner of this website, has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: www.eyeglasses.com. 

**How we use IP addresses**   
An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers -- the big computers that "serve up" Web pages -- automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When guests request pages from eyeglasses.com sites, our servers log the guests' IP addresses. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. 

Eyeglasses.com, Inc. collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart. 

**Use of cookies--the eyeglasses.com cookie statement**   
What are cookies? Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make Web-surfing easier for customers by saving their passwords, purchases, and preferences while they're at our site. The use of cookies is an industry standard -- you'll find them at most major Web sites. 

By showing how and when guests use a site, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. 

Our site uses cookies to keep track of your shopping cart. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. Cookies are also required for customers to enjoy the e Try It Onsm feature. 

A cookie lets the computers remember that you've registered, which allows us to speed up your future activities at our sites. Similarly, Eyeglasses.com, Inc. uses a temporary cookie to track which products you've chosen to purchase while shopping. The cookie expires once you're done shopping. Letting it do the record keeping saves you the trouble of entering information over and over again during a single visit. If you decline this cookie, you may have difficulty ordering your selections. 

Eyeglasses.com, Inc. never uses cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. Eyeglasses.com, Inc. does not use information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes, nor is that information shared with any third parties whatsoever. Eyeglasses.com, Inc. does not use cookies to identify specific individuals, except in such cases as online shopping (see above). 

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some parts of the site, such as the shopping area, will not function properly if you do so. 

**Links to other sites**   
Users should be aware that when they are on Eyeglasses.com, Inc. sites they could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There are links to other sites from Eyeglasses.com, Inc. sites that take you outside our service. For example, if you click on a link to an eye health-related site, the click takes you off the Eyeglasses.com, Inc. site. This includes links from sponsors and partners that may use Eyeglasses.com, Inc.'s logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. Always be aware of where you end up. We cannot be responsible for your security on sites that are linked to ours. 

**Information we collect**
