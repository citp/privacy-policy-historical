Returns

When you order from us online, you are entitled to a cooling off period when you can return your unopened / unused goods without any penalty. Our cooling off period is 7 days, which includes any statutory cooling off period.

This period starts the day the contract is agreed (i.e. you receive an email from us saying we have dispatched your order) and ends 7 days after the day following delivery of the goods.

**Return by post**  
The card you used to pay will be refunded on receipt of goods, provided they are returned in the same condition as when you received them ie unopened / unused.

What you need to do:  
Place the items into their original presentation boxes and make sure the parcel is sealed securely. You should also place a copy of the dispatch note you received with your order into the parcel. For refunds: once we have assessed the items, the money will be put back on to the credit/debit card that was used to place the order online. For exchanges: you will need to contact us by e-mail: [orders@eyeko.com](mailto:orders@eyeko.com)
