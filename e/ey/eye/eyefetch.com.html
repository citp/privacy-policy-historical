        We are committed to protecting your personal information and your privacy is very important to us. We have implemented this policy to inform you of the information we collect from you and how we use that information. By visiting Eyefetch you expressly consent to our collection, storage, use, and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy and to our Terms of Use.<br>
        <br>
        Eyefetch collects personally identifiable information ("PII") about you that you specifically and voluntarily provide. PII includes information that can identify you as a specific individual, such as your name or e-mail address.

        <br>
        <strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong><br>
        <br>
        We may occasionally revise this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our services and from customer feedback. When any changes are made to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the “last updated” date at the bottom of this statement. If there are material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by prominently posting a notice on our site or by directly sending you a notification to the email address you have registered on our site.
