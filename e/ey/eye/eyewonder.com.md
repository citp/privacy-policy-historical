When an EyeWonder® advertisement is received on a computer or other electronic device, EyeWonder utilizes techniques to determine whether that device has previously received the advertisement, as well as techniques to evaluate the user’s interaction with the advertisement (including any information voluntarily provided by the user in surveys or otherwise). Such information is used to avoid sending repetitive advertising to the user, as well as to customize subsequent advertising to enhance the user’s experience and to comport with the user’s habits or preferences, and to sometimes measure the effectiveness of the advertisement. From time to time, advertisers, publishers or portals request that EyeWonder collect, or assist in the collection of, information supplied by consumers in connection with an EyeWonder® advertisement, or a user’s interaction with such an advertisement, which may include personal information. This information is provided directly to the advertiser, publisher and/or portal, and is not used independently by EyeWonder. EyeWonder is informed that this information is to be used by the advertiser, publisher and/or portal, in accordance its own particular privacy policy. However, EyeWonder cannot control the use of such information by any such advertiser, publisher or portal, and is not responsible for their use of such information.

For visitors who contact EyeWonder via e-mail or who participate in an online survey, the information provided in the e-mail message or survey response is collected, including the visitor’s e-mail address, and any questions or comments the visitor provides.
