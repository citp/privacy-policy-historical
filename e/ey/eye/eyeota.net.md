1\. Platform Data

**What does Eyeota’s Platform do?**

Eyeota owns and operates a technology platform (the “Platform”) which collects, organizes, maintains and distributes pseudonymized profile information (the “Platform Data”). Platform Data is collected from a variety of online sources, such as website publishers, and also offline data sources such as market research companies.

**What is the purpose of Eyeota’s Platform?**

Eyeota’s Platform allows Eyeota’s clients to buy, sell & distribute Platform Data for the specific purposes of:

  * Facilitating targeted advertising
  * Facilitating the delivery of targeted or customized content to website visitors
  * Supporting an advertising funded internet
  * Providing aggregated reporting to data providers and advertisers
  * Using aggregated data for internal reporting, reporting industry trends & market research



Eyeota’s clients and partners are contractually obliged to have adequate privacy policies which also facilitate these purposes.

**What information does Eyeota Platform hold?**

The Platform Data that is sent to us by our partners includes aggregated pseudonymized profile information, and data that is sent via the HTTP header including IP address, cookie information, date and time, URLs, operating system, and browser version.

The pseudonymized profile information is aggregated and then organized in to audience segments that fall into the categories of interest data (e.g., interest in sports, news, fashion and associated sub-categories etc.), demographic data (e.g., age, gender, employment sector, income band etc.) and purchase intent data (e.g. in-market for electronics, financial products, online fashion etc.).

Eyeota’s Platform is not designed to collect any Personal Data such as full name, email address, physical address or sensitive Personal Data such as social security number etc. In addition, our clients and partners are contractually prohibited from transmitting any data which can directly identify an individual to Eyeota. We do not intentionally collect data that we consider to be sensitive.

The definition of Sensitive Data within the EU (as defined by Article 9.1 of the General Data protection Regulation or “GDPR”) includes:

  * Racial or ethnic origin
  * Political opinions
  * Religious or philosophical beliefs
  * Trade union membership
  * Genetic or biometric data
  * Personal health data
  * Information concerning a person’s sex life or sexual orientation·



In the US and Asia, Eyeota does receive the following data from some of our data providers:

  * Inferred racial or ethnic origin
  * Inferred political opinions
  * Inferred religious or philosophical beliefs
  * Eyeota does hold some non-sensitive data that is related to health or financial positions; lists of these segments can be found [here](http://eyeota.com/privacy-policy/health-related-segments/) and [here](http://eyeota.com/privacy-policy/finance-related-segments/).
  * Eyeota does not collect any data related to adult-oriented products or services such as alcohol, tobacco or firearms.



For information relating to our age data policies, please refer to the Protecting Children’s Data section of this policy under 4. Personal Rights for EU Data Subjects below.

**What is Eyeota Platform Data used for?**

Eyeota’s Platform is designed to enable manufacturers and brands to discover audiences who may have a preference for their advertising. The platform helps advertisers discover new audiences who have traits, preferences and interests which are similar to their existing customers or their desired audiences. Eyeota’s Platform Data is useful to a number of different groups

  1. **Internet Users** will experience more relevant online advertising as a result of the services provided by the Platform. In addition, the operation of the Platform helps to support an advertising funded internet where many online publishers offer content free of charge to users. All Platform Data held by Eyeota is in a pseudonymized form and includes no data that can identify specific individuals, e.g., no full name, address, email address, phone number, social security number, etc.
  2. **Online Advertisers** use the Platform to help them deliver advertising to relevant online audiences; discover new potential customers who have a preference for their products and services and to increase the efficiency of their advertising campaigns. Online advertisers can also use Eyeota’s Platform to better understand their customers, and the recipients of their ad campaigns. For example, a beauty manufacturer may use Eyeota data to discover new audiences who have similar interests and preferences to their existing audience base. Because the new aggregated audiences are similar to the Beauty Manufacturer’s existing customers, it increases the likelihood that any advertising shown to the new audiences may be of interest to them,
  3. **Online Data Providers**
    * who deliver the Platform Data to Eyeota find the Platform useful as they are able to gain greater insights in to their audiences, helping them to make more informed commercial decisions and to improve the value of the content and/or advertising on their own online properties. For example, a publisher in the auto vertical may discover, via the Platform, that these audiences are also interested in eating out and fitness. These insights may help the publisher decide what advertising to run on their website, or what additional content to create for their audiences.
    * who are able to sell aggregated pseudonymized data to advertisers to better inform their advertising campaigns (see 1. above). This data is aggregated by groups of interest, preference or relevance on the Eyeota Platform, e.g. males with a preference for organic food and sold in this form to advertisers who are looking to target people with this preference. The revenue earned from the sale of this data is provided to the Online Data Providers who typically use the funds to support the production of content and services on these online properties, many of which provide content and services free of charge to internet users.
  4. **Market Research Agencies and other Offline Data Providers** use their customer and survey data for traditional offline marketing campaigns (such as advertising through direct mail, printed media, outdoor advertising, TV & radio). These offline data providers find the Platform useful as it enables them to transfer the pseudonymized data in to the online environment so that their advertising clients can also use this interest and preference information when discovering new audiences for their advertising campaigns.



If, at any time, you would like to opt-out of participating in this type of online interest-based advertising where the adverts you see can be based on your pseudonymized profile information, please go to the opt-out section of this policy.

The Platform is operated by Eyeota Pte Ltd, a Singapore registered company with company number 201223893Z and with the registered address of

Eyeota Pte Ltd

12a Upper Circular Road

058410

Singapore.

**How does Eyeota collect Platform Data?**

We use online technologies such as Cookies, Pixel Tags, Server-to-Server Connections and Secure Data Transfers with our partners to collect and store Platform Data. We do not use “flash cookies” or any other embedded tracking mechanisms.

**How does Eyeota use cookies within the Eyeota Platform?**

Eyeota’s Platform utilizes cookies for identifying individual browsers and storing data against cookie IDs for the purposes of interest-based advertising and analytics. The Platform also uses cookies to store users’ opt-out preferences. Eyeota’s cookies are considered to be “third-party” cookies; please note that some browsers or other software might be configured to block third-party cookies by default.

**Does Eyeota process data collected from consent signals?**

Yes. Eyeota is a registered Global Vendor within the IAB Transparency and Consent Framework (IAB Vendor ID: 120) which in turn pushes vendor list and consent rights through various market-facing Consent Management Platforms (CMPs). We use this framework to collect and manage consent signals from our data partners for Matching Data to Offline Sources as well as for the purposes of Storage and Access of Information, Personalisation, Ad Selection, Reporting and Delivery, Content Delivery, Selection and Reporting, and Measurement.

Our platform also accepts consent-based data sets from CMPs that operate outside of the IAB Transparency and Consent Framework.

**Does Eyeota also accept data collected under Legitimate Interest?**

Yes. Some of our data partners have chosen to handle data collection for pseudonymous targeting under legitimate interest. Following the legitimate interest provisions of GDPR, we accept this data. However, we also require additional information that supports a data provider’s case for legitimate interest.

Eyeota is able to filter and separate data collected under consent and legitimate interest and provide specific siloed consent data based on client demand.

We believe it is likely that consent will ultimately be required under the ePrivacy Regulation and strongly encourage our data partners to obtain a consent as (may be) required under the ePrivacy Regulation.

**What is Eyeota’s legal basis for collecting and processing Platform Data in the EEA?**

For data from EU data subjects processed via the Platform, Eyeota operates under the legitimate interest provisions of the GDPR.

For example, as you use the internet to discover content, products and services or to use a digital service for your daily life, advertising may be served to you that is relevant to your interests or lifestyle. Brands and Advertisers use data companies like Eyeota to identify groups of people with particular interests or preferences so that they can serve advertising that is more relevant to them than other groups of people.

This legal basis of legitimate interest is founded on the position that the advertising funded internet delivers significant value to internet users as well as wider economies. The types of data segments utilized by Eyeota (e.g., pseudonymous Personal Data) and the profiling activities are not generally considered high risk. Eyeota adopts controls to ensure that the data collected is secured and won’t fall into the hands of an entity that might be in position to harm the human rights of data subjects. Thus, the balance of interests leans towards benefits generated for data subjects, publishers and advertisers outweigh the risks to the fundamental human rights of data subjects.

The only data that Eyeota interacts with which are directly classified as Personal Data under the GDPR are IP addresses and cookie IDs. However, as all profile information is attached to pseudonymous Personal Data such as a cookie ID, all profile information is also considered to be Personal Data.

For Eyeota to process your data, you may have consented to accept a cookie or to processing of your data from one of our partner data providers, thus, we also expect to handle data that has been collected and provided on the basis of consent.

If you have any further questions relating to Eyeota’s legal basis for collecting and processing data in the European Economic Area, please contact us [here](http://eyeota.com/contact/).

**How long does Eyeota store Platform Data for?**

  * Eyeota limits the number of days which aggregated information is available for targeted advertising to 120 days.
  * All user level data is deleted after 13-months.
  * The only data that Eyeota retains for longer than 13-months is in aggregated form and to support Statistical Data Modelling and Analysis: (e.g., how many profiles of males were active in the Eyeota Platform in the UK in December 2015) We hold these reports indefinitely to help us understand the evolution of the business, to conduct commercial analysis and make business decisions, although we take care to ensure that none of the information within the reports may be used to identify an actual person.



**What Platform Data information is shared with third parties?**

Eyeota shares Platform Data with partners who provide online advertising services to marketers, advertisers and online publishers. For a full list of the organizations that receive Platform Data from Eyeota directly, please refer to Eyeota’s Integration list [here](http://eyeota.com/privacy-policy/integrations/). We will endeavor to keep this list updated on a regular basis as our partners may change from time to time.

Reporting is also an integral part of Eyeota’s business. Under contract, our clients and data providers receive periodic operational reports for performance tracking and billing and auditing. We also generate reports that provide insights on the popularity and usage of the aggregated data, such as the number of data subjects that appear in a segment, in aggregate. The reports are prepared using aggregated Platform Data and contain only pseudonymized data.

The aggregated Platform Data may be shared with authorized employees, independent contractors, consultants and subsidiaries. User level Platform Data is only made available to full time employees in our technology team, who need access to execute their job requirements, on a limited access basis, and in line with our Data Minimization Policy (Eyeota Company Policy designed to protect the individual rights of data subjects or users and to ensure that employees understand their obligations with respect to user level data).

We may also use the services of third-party service providers for cloud data storage, analysis, and processing facilities and to provide operational or other support services. The Platform Data is shared only to enable these entities to perform professional and technical functions in relation to Eyeota’s business. These entities are subject to confidentiality restrictions and are not authorized to use, access or transform the Platform Data for any purpose other than providing their services to Eyeota.

We may be required to share Platform Data and information with regulatory authorities, government agencies, and law enforcement officials, as permitted or enforced by law. Additionally we may share data and information to defend or protect our legal rights, our intellectual and physical property, our employees and service providers, the safety and security of our business partners and their online users, and to protect us against fraud.

Finally, we may share some or all Platform Data and information assets if our company is sold, acquired, transferred or merged, files bankruptcy, undergoes debt refinancing, undergoes any form organizational change or any other business transaction that may require assets under our control to transferred to third parties as part of the business transaction. In these instances, Eyeota will take the steps necessary to ensure that the Platform Data and information will continue to be governed by this privacy policy.

6\. Glossary of Terms

To aid your understanding of our Privacy Policy, please refer to the following definitions:

**COOKIE**

A cookie is a small text file that is downloaded onto a computer or smartphone when a user accesses a website. It allows the website to recognize that user’s device and store some information about the user’s preferences or past actions. The use of cookies is an industry standard on most websites, with most browsers being set up to accept them by default. The default browser setting may be changed to increase notification (a web user can receive alerts when a cookie is sent) or to prevent cookies from being placed on the user’s hard drive (cookie blocking).

When you visit a website, a cookie is downloaded onto your device, the next time you visit the website, your device will check to see if you have received a cookie already and if so send that information back to the website. Most websites use cookies to allow visitors to navigate more easily; or tailor content based on past content you engaged with; or remember login information or specific preferences from your last visit. If the cookies are blocked or rejected, it is more difficult for the website to provide this capability. Since cookies are unique to each browser on the user’s device, different devices or multiple computers or browsers will each have their own cookie settings and changing these will require changes to each computer and each browser setting.

The mechanism to control browser settings for managing cookies varies by browser. For information on managing cookies, check your browser’s help file.

Eyeota cookies are stored for 1 year from the time our systems last see your browser on your device and then deleted automatically.

**INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING**

The ability for advertisers to target end users based on their preferences or interests.

**MARKET RESEARCH COMPANIES**

Companies that gather and analyze opinions and attitudes towards goods or services through direct consumer research. The companies determine the relevance of a product or service among its target consumers and other groups.

**OFFLINE DATA**

Data that is gathered from offline data sources including CRM platforms, loyalty cards, survey responses and that is used for marketing. Offline data is generally provided to Eyeota in non personally identifiable form. (e.g., aggregated by postal code).

**PERSONAL DATA**

Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person; an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. In some places such as the European Union, certain pseudonymous identifiers such as IP address, cookie ID and mobile advertising ID are considered Personal Data. In this privacy policy, we’ll try to distinguish between Personal Data (e.g., email address, telephone number) and pseudonymous Personal Data (e.g., IP address, cookie ID).

**PIXEL TAGS**

Pixel tags or “pixels” are terms that are used to describe a common technique which allows for a web page to call a server when it loads. The technique leverages the mechanism by which web browsers typically would download images from a server, namely through the use of an HTML <img> tag. Typically, the image tag would contain the address of the image on the server to be downloaded. In this case, however, instead of sending the image address, the browser sends a structured request to the server which can contain any data that is available to the browser at that point. Examples of this include, but are not limited to: the browser type, operating system, date and time information and other technical information about the user’s computer, data collected from the user by the website, as well as certain information about the identity of the website visited immediately before coming to a website. When the server replies to the browser, it sends back a tiny, transparent image (the actual “pixel”) which is rendered by the browser on the page. In this way, from the browser’s point of view, it has requested and been delivered an image.

As with any HTTP call to a server, the browser will transmit any http cookie files alongside the image call. These cookies are created and stored in the browser by the server, and can be used to store any arbitrary information. Typically they are used to identify the browser (and by extension, the user) to the server over successive calls over time. As per the HTTP standard, only cookies associated with the server’s domain can be viewed, set, deleted, or modified by the server. There is no way for the server to access or modify cookies set by other domains.

Eyeota collects Platform Data over time from cookies associated with pixel tags that have been placed on partner websites.

**PLATFORM**

Eyeota’s proprietary technology platform which collects, organizes, creates, maintains, and distributes pseudonymized profile information.

**PLATFORM DATA**

The data which is processed on the Platform.

**PSEUDONYMIZED DATA**

Data which has been processed in such a manner that it can no longer be attributed to a specific identifiable natural person without the use of additional information.

**DEMOGRAPHIC DATA**

Statistically gathered data that comprises age, gender and income of a population.

**PURCHASE INTENT DATA**

Data that explicitly or implicitly implies a subject’s intent to purchase a particular good or service. Purchase intent data is gathered from e-retailer websites, classified and auction sites, and price comparison websites.

**Explicit purchase intent data** is generated when the subject expresses specific details unique to their requirements during the path to purchase. Examples of explicit purchase intent data include: filling a shopping basket with product, completing a booking form, inputting specific parameters when searching eg flight search by date, and using product or service configuration platforms.

**Implicit purchase intent data** is generated when the subject expresses interest in a product or service by searching for products or services within e-retailer websites, classified and auction sites, and price comparison websites.

**INTEREST DATA**

Data generated based on a subject’s behavior when they search and browse websites and search engines. Interest data is qualified on the frequency by which a subject searches specific interest topics, products or services.

**SERVER-TO-SERVER CONNECTIONS**

Direct technical connections and integrations with Eyeota and a technology partner whereby Eyeota may obtain data from other online and offline third-party sources through various secure information transfer methods. Only Pseudonymized Data is transferred to Eyeota through these server-to-server connections.

**SECURE DATA TRANSFERS**

Encrypted methods of transferring data containing Platform Data (including Platform Data coming from offline data sources) from third parties to Eyeota. No Personal Data is transferred to Eyeota through these secure data transfers.
