      <p align="JUSTIFY">
          Some services of the Community use cookies to offer you a convenient online service featuring numerous functions. Cookies are text files containing
          information to identify returning visitors exclusively for the time of their visit to the Community. Cookies are saved on the hard disk of your computer
          and do not cause any harm. Cookies spare you the burden of entering data repeatedly, facilitate the transfer of specific content and help us to identify
          especially popular sections of our online service. Among others, they enable us to tailor the content of the Community to your needs.
      </p>

          </p><h5>7. Google Analytics</h5>
      <p></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">
          For the services of the Community, we use Google Analytics, a web analysing tool by Google Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses so-called "Cookies", text
          files which are saved on your computer enabling an analysis of your use of the Community. The information generated by the cookie is, as a rule,
          transmitted to a Google sever in the USA where it will be saved. However, if IP anonymisation is activated in the Community, your IP address will be
          shortened within the member states of the European Union or other contracting parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, prior to
          transmission.
      </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">
          Only in exceptional cases, is the full IP address transmitted to a server of Google in the USA and shortened there. On behalf of EyeEm, Google will use
          this information to analyse your use of the Community, compile reports on the activities of the Community and to render further services in connection with
          the use of the Community to EyeEm. The IP address transmitted by your browser within the framework of Google Analytics will not be merged with other data
          collected by Google.
      </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">
          You can prevent your browser from saving cookies by setting your software accordingly; however, be advised that you might not be able to use all Community
          functions to their full extent. In addition, you can prevent the collection of the Community usage data (incl. your IP address), which were generated by
      the cookie as well as the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing the following browser plugin using the following link:    <u><a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de</a></u>.

      <p></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">
          For the services of the Community, we use Localytics, an analysing service that collects location information of your mobile device. The location
          information gained in this way is, as a rule, transmitted to and served on a server of Localytics in the USA. There the information is analysed and
          transmitted to us. This service enables us to make the Community user-friendlier and more attractive, and to integrate location specific services.
      </p>
      <p>
          </p><h5>9. Location information</h5>
      <p></p>
      <p lang="en-GB" align="JUSTIFY">
          If you share your location with other users or add a location description to some content you uploaded to the Community, we will treat this information in

          User or other persons as well as the parts of the service protected by copyright; and (f) as otherwise herein explained.
      </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">

      <p align="JUSTIFY">
          </p><h5>12. References and links</h5>
      <p></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">
          Liability for contents of external linked websites (“Hyperlinks”) that lie outside the sphere of responsibility of EyeEm is only assumed if EyeEm is aware
          of the infringing content and only in the scope of the technically possible and reasonable.
      </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">
          EyeEm hereby expressly declares that, at the time of the linking, no illegal contents were recognisable on the pages that were to be linked. EyeEm is
          completely without influence on the current and future form, on the contents and on the authorship of the linked/connected pages. EyeEm therefore herewith
          expressly dissociates itself from all contents of all linked/connected pages that were changed after the linking. This statement is valid for all links and
          references established in the EyeEm´s own internet offering, as well as for foreign entries in visitor’s books, forums, link directories and mailing lists
          and in all kinds of databases where external input to the content is possible. The provider of the pages, to which reference is made, is liable for
          illegal, incorrect or incomplete contents and, in particular, for damages which result from the use or non-use of such offered information, and not he who
          merely makes reference to the particular publication via a link.
      </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">
          </p><h5>13. Data security</h5>
      <p></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">
          We employ technical and organisational measures in order to safeguard the Community and other systems against loss, destruction, access, changes or the
          distribution of your data by unauthorised persons. Despite regular controls a complete protection against all dangers is, however, not possible.
      </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">
          The access to your Community account is possible only after entering your personal password. You should always treat your access information confidentially
          and close the browser window, once you have ended your communication with us, particularly if you share the use of the computer with others.

          Through the Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz), you have the guaranteed rights to information, correction, deletion or blocking of
          personal data. These rights are to be exercised by a message sent by mail or e-mail to EyeEm´s address mentioned above or the following e-mail address
