                                            For example, our order form has an ‘opt-out’ mechanism so users who buy a product
                                            from us, but don’t want any marketing material, can keep their email address off of
                                            our lists. Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications
                                            may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the subject

                                            We also offer an opt-out mechanism on the&nbsp;"My&nbsp;Account" page in&nbsp;the
