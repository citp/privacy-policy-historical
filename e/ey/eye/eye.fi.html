<h1>Eye-Fi Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last Revised August 15, 2011</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Eye-Fi is committed to protecting the confidentiality of your personal information, as well as the content of your photos and videos, according to your sharing preferences.</p>
<p>This document describes our policy regarding privacy protection, and identifies information sharing requirements and security measures taken by Eye-Fi. This policy applies to all of the products, services and websites offered by Eye-Fi, Inc.</p>
<p>We may from time-to-time revise this Privacy Policy by posting notice of these revisions at this page no later than 30 days prior to the date that the revisions are to take effect, and in the case of material changes, we will notify you at the e-mail address associated with your account. The date of last revision will be available at the top of this page, so please be sure to check back periodically.  If you have questions about this policy, contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@eye.fi">privacy@eye.fi</a>.</p>
<h2>Personal Information We Collect</h2>
<p>“Personal information” means (a) information that allows others to contact or to individually identify you, and (b) other information to the extent that it is associated with the information listed in (a).  We collect personal information in the following ways:</p>
<p>You will need to create an Eye-Fi account to configure your Eye-Fi card’s wireless connectivity as well as to take advantage of the many additional Eye-Fi service offerings.  The personal information that Eye-Fi requires you submit when creating an Eye-Fi account are your email address and a password, which is used to protect your account from unauthorized access.</p>
<p>When you transfer your photos, videos and related EXIF data (collectively, “content”) from your Eye-Fi card or natively enabled Eye-Fi camera solely to your computer, smartphone, tablet or other supported Eye-Fi electronic device, Eye-Fi does not share or transfer any user content from your computer to Eye-Fi servers.  However, if you choose to enable additional features or services offered by Eye-Fi, including the geotagging service, content sharing service (such as sharing with third party websites like Facebook, Flickr, Picasa, etc.), relayed uploads feature,  Eye-Fi View service, email, notifications, sharing feature and hotspot service (collectively “Eye-Fi services”), Eye-Fi transfers your content to Eye-Fi’s servers and into your Eye-Fi account where the content can be acted upon in fulfillment of your requested Eye-Fi services.</p>
<p>When you access your Eye-Fi account and utilize Eye-Fi services, Eye-Fi automatically records certain information about your use, such as account activity, data displayed or clicked on, and other information including browser type, IP address, date and time of access, cookie ID, and referrer URL.  Some of this information collected, such as IP address and the contents of certain cookies, may include personal information.</p>
<p>It is a violation of our terms of service for anyone under 13 to use the Eye-Fi services.  Consequently, we do not intentionally gather personal information about visitors who are under the age of 13.</p>
<h2>How Your Personal Information is Used and Shared</h2>
<p>Some Eye-Fi services are executed through third party business partners and service providers, and in these cases your personal information is shared with the third party business partner or service provider in order to fulfill the requested service.</p>
<p>From time to time, Eye-Fi may enter into relationships with strategic business partners to produce product offerings that are “co-branded” with the brands of both Eye-Fi and such strategic business partner.  In those cases, if you purchase a co-branded product offering, Eye-Fi may share your personal information with the applicable third-party business partner in order to facilitate that business partner’s provision of support services, warranty services, or other elements of the co-branded product offering or related aftermarket services to you.  For example, if Eye-Fi’s business partner is responsible for providing end-user support for the co-branded product in a given geographic territory, Eye-Fi may share your account information, support entitlement status, and other relevant personal information with such business partner to allow the business partner’s support personnel to provide support services to you.</p>
<p>When you use Eye-Fi to share your content with a third party website or to email your content to your friends, Eye-Fi will use your personal information to fulfill the requested services. Eye-Fi also uses your personal information to provide you with personalized content, to respond to your inquiries, to maintain and improve the Eye-Fi services, to alert you to new features or promotions, and to enforce the End User License Agreement and Terms of Service (called the “Terms of Service”).</p>
<p>In the future, Eye-Fi may sell our company or some or all or our assets. In such transactions, customer information (including your personal information) generally is one of the transferred business assets.  In the event a sale of our assets includes our database, your personal information will be transferred.  We will require buyers to honor our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Although we currently do not have a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, “Affiliates”), we may in the future.  We may share some or all of your personal information with these Affiliates, in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Information Eye-Fi receives through its relationships with other companies and websites may be combined with the personal information we collect and will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We may also, and you authorize us to, share your personal information in response to a subpoena, legal order or official request, when we believe you have acted in violation of the Terms of Service, or when we believe that doing so may protect your safety or the safety of others.</p>
<p>Information that contains no personally identifiable information, i.e., deidentified data, may be shared with third parties or used for any reason.</p>
<h2>How Your Information is Protected, Maintained and Deleted</h2>
<p>Eye-Fi attempts to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of your personal information. Our servers and systems are protected by reasonable physical and electronic security measures.</p>
<p>You may delete your Eye-Fi account and all of your content at your discretion through the Eye-Fi Center software.  Notwithstanding anything in this Privacy Policy to the contrary, requests to delete your personal information and content are subject to all applicable legal obligations that Eye-Fi may be required to abide by, and you acknowledge that some copies of your content may remain in our archives.</p>
<h2>How We Use Cookies</h2>
<p>Like many websites, Eye-Fi make use of cookies which are small data files that can be placed on your hard drive when you visit Eye-Fi websites.</p>
<p>When you use the Eye-Fi service or visit Eye-Fi websites, Eye-Fi sends one or more cookies to your computer that uniquely identifies your Internet browser. We use cookies to collect, store and sometimes track information for statistical purposes to improve the services we provide. If you are a registered user, we will use a cookie to save your settings and to provide customizable and personalized services. Additionally, be aware that if you visit other websites you may be required to accept cookies. Advertisers and partners may also use their own cookies. We do not control use of these cookies and expressly disclaim responsibility for information collected through them.</p>
<p>From time to time Eye-Fi will merchandise its products with the use of internet based advertising companies (such as Xgraph).  These companies will use cookies and other information (but not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements for products and services (including those of third parties) which may be of interest to you.  If you wish to opt-out from these forms of marketing on (or with respect to your use of) the Eye-Fi website, please follow the opt-out instructions at the following links:</p>
<p><a href="http://xgraph.net/opt-out.html">http://xgraph.net/opt-out.html</a> – Eye-Fi sometimes uses Xgraph for merchandising.  This link will take you to the Xgraph “opt out” page.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a> – This is an industry association that consolidates “opt outs”.  From time to time Eye-Fi might use some of these companies services.</p>
<h2>Anonymous Application Usage Reporting</h2>
<p>Eye-Fi uses software in its applications to collect anonymous usage data for the purpose of improving Eye-Fi products and services.</p>
<h2>Application of This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to websites, software and services that are owned and operated by Eye-Fi, Inc. Eye-Fi does not exercise control over websites owned or operated by third parties (for example, Flickr®, Picasa™, and Facebook™) to which you may distribute your content . These third parties may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, and have their own unique approaches on data collection and use.  So please keep in mind that Eye-Fi is not responsible for the privacy practices of these websites and programs. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of every site that collects data or other personal information from you.</p>
<p>Eye-Fi processes personal information on servers in the United States of America. In some cases, Eye-Fi may process your personal information on a server outside your own country, where laws regarding processing of personal information may be less stringent than the laws in your country.</p>
