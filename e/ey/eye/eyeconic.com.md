(a)      **Information You Provide.** When you register or interact with the Site, we may ask that you provide us with certain information to facilitate your use of the Site, such as your first name, last name, email, phone number, gender and date of birth. In case you decide to purchase product, we may ask you to provide additional information, such as your full address and credit card details and share your personal information with companies who help us in the fulfillment of your request. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide their services. For instance, we communicate your credit card details to a third party payment processor (Eyeconic does not store any credit card information). You will also be required to create a username and password to establish an account. Depending upon the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory, and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.

(b)      **Technical Information Obtained from the Use of the Site.** We collect certain technical information automatically when you use the Site to facilitate our provision of the services, which information may include the domain from which you access the Site, the date and time you access the Site, what areas of the Site you access, the IP address, unique device identifier, and the type of device and/or web browser you use to access the Site.

(c)      **Cookies and Other Technologies.** We our service providers, and other third parties (such as Facebook) may use cookies, web beacons – also referred to as single-pixel gifs – and other storage technologies to improve the Site and its functionality, provide measurement services and target advertising. Cookies are identifiers that a website stores on your computer's hard drive to facilitate the interaction between your computer and the website. We use several types of cookies that have different purposes. We use cookies that are essential to the operation of the Site (e.g. allowing you to place items in the shopping bag and purchase these items or allowing us to identify you and provide you access to your user account). These essential cookies are either session or persistent cookies. Session cookies expire when you close your browser. Persistent cookies remain stored on your computer or device until you delete them manually or until they expire. Please see below on how to block or delete cookies.

Other cookies make your use of the Site easier (e.g. allowing us to remember you and your preferences upon your next visit to the Site when checking “Remember Me”), make the Site run more smoothly to make it easier for you to navigate and enhance the experience of our Site and help us to maintain a secure Site. These functionality cookies are persistent cookies and exclusive to this Site and cannot be obtained or read by other websites.

Web beacons are embedded in webpages and permit us to count users who have visited those pages and for other related Site statistics in a manner similar to the use of cookies (e.g., recording the popularity of certain Site content and verifying system and server integrity). Web beacons are not used to access your personal information on our Site; they are solely used to compile aggregated statistics concerning the use of our Site.

(d)      **Targeted Advertising.** Eyeconic and our advertisers may use technologies such as cookies and remarketing tags to gather information about your activities on this Site and other sites and to help us recognize you and serve you with advertisements that we believe are relevant to you and your interests. However, we do not tell our advertisers who you are.

Cookie ID’s are used to target Eyeconic advertising that is relevant to the Site, to control the frequency of ads shown to you, and to help us monitor, improve, and evaluate our online advertising and campaign performance. Google’s DoubleClick cookie is a persistent cookie and does not store or contain personally identifiable information. With your consent, information associated with the DoubleClick cookie may be added to your Google account.

This Site also uses a Facebook Tag API and Custom Audience Pixel Tags through similar use of cookieID’s to collect data about activities of users that are sent to Facebook to track conversions and to allow Eyeconic to create custom audiences for the products or service that Eyeconic may advertise on Facebook. This Facebook cookie is a persistent cookie and does not store or contain personally identifiable information.

We also use technology that enables us to understand how our Site or mobile applications are used and tools to enable the display of targeted advertisements to our users, including across devices. For example, this technology allows us to determine the probability that a desktop web cookie and a mobile device belong to the same user. The Drawbridge cookie is a persistent cookie and does not store or contain personally identifiable information.
