        <p><strong>Our commitment to privacy:</strong>  eyeReturn Marketing Inc. ("eyeReturn"), knows that protecting the privacy and confidentiality of your information is important to you. This Privacy Code governs the collection, use and disclosure of your information in any form, whether written or electronic, by eyeReturn. This Privacy Code explains what information may be collected from you and how it is used. It also explains how you can ask questions, make suggestions, and express concerns about our privacy practices. </p>
        <p>This Privacy Code applies only to the information collected by
eyeReturn. The collection, use and disclosure of your personal information is governed by applicable privacy laws, including the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (the “Act”), and any applicable provincial legislation.  eyeReturn does not collect any personally identifying information in connection with the delivery of our clients’ advertisements, nor from the websites on which those advertisements appear.</p>

        <p>This Privacy Code is available to the public through our website, and in paper form from eyeReturn. If you have any additional concerns or questions, we encourage you to contact us and we will address your concerns to the best of our ability. <strong>Please read this Privacy Code carefully, and check back periodically as we may update it from time to time.  
        
        </strong></p><p><strong><strong>What information do we collect, and why?</strong></strong></p><strong>

        <ul>
            <li>eyeReturn serves advertisements from hundreds of third party advertisers across numerous publisher websites. When you visit one of the publishers’ websites, eyeReturn’s automated system may collect “click stream data” related to your visit to the website. Click stream data is anonymous and can include information such as web pages viewed, the date and time those pages were viewed, banner advertisements that were shown and your interaction with content and advertisements on those websites. This information can also be used for online preference marketing purposes. Technologies used to collect this stream data include cookies, web beacons or pixels.</li>
            <li>We collect demographic information, as well as ads served to you and your response thereto, in order to gain a better understanding of your interests so that we may develop better products and services, and to determine your eligibility for other products and services on behalf of our clients.</li>
            <li>If you use a publishers’ websites where eyeReturn is serving an ad, we may assign an internet cookie. An internet cookie is a small file assigned to your internet browser that can collect and store information. We use cookies to better understand how you use our websites, to make sure our ads and dynamic content are served correctly and for analytics and reporting purposes.  For example, a cookie may recall an ad that you have seen so that you do not see the same ad over and over--thus enhancing your website viewing experience. Storing cookies on your web browser allows us to present you with web pages and other content that are attuned with your preferences. These activities are invisible to you, and are generally intended to improve your internet surfing convenience. Unless you have set your preferences so that you will be alerted when a cookie is being stored on your computer, you won’t know about it. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on these publishers’ website. <br> <br>We set our browser cookies to expire after two years. The cookie expiration date will be updated each time a browser requests resources from our server.  User level segment data inside the cookie may be retained for the lifetime of the cookie, in the cookie, however data stored inside the cookie is aged, and often will be deleted in a period of hours or days. We collect anonymous segmentation data in server log files. These logs are processed daily for aggregated ad delivery and reporting summaries. The data in the log files cannot be tied to specific browsers. The summarized reports are kept indefinitely.</li>
            <li>If you are concerned about cookies, it is possible to turn them off in your web browser preferences. However, please be aware that by disabling cookies, your web surfing experience will be degraded.</li>
            <li>We may from time to time use IP (internet protocol) addresses to undertake aggregate browser statistics, determine the approximate location of browsers, diagnose problems with our servers, and optimize and administer our web services.</li>
            <li>We may, from time to time, track and analyze anonymous usage and browsing patterns of visitors to our websites to provide our advertisers with more targeted advertising opportunities and to help users see advertising that is most likely to interest them.</li>
            <li>Other than as permitted or required by law, if we wish to collect, use or disclose your information for purposes that are not contemplated in this Privacy Code, we will identify those purposes at the time of collection. You will be given a reasonable opportunity to opt-out of any such additional purposes. </li>
        </ul>

For example, we may use health related segments such as “Health and Fitness Enthusiast” or “Eco-Conscious Consumer” to tailor relevant ads on behalf of our advertiser clients.  We may also use segments such as “Beer Drinker” or “Food and Entertaining Enthusiast”.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
