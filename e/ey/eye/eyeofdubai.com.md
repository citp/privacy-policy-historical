**2\. Visitor Information  
**During the course of any visit to eyeofdubai.com, the pages you see, along with a short text file called a 'cookie', are downloaded to your computer. Many websites do this, because cookies enable website publishers to do useful things like find out whether the computer (and probably its user) has visited the website before. This is done on a repeat visit by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last visit.  
Information supplied by cookies can help us to provide you with a better online user experience and assist us to analyze the profile of our visitors.

**3\. What is a cookie?**  
A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a website's computer and stored on your computer's hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.  
Many sites do this whenever a user visits their website in order to track online traffic flows.  
Cookies record information about your online preferences. Users have the opportunity to set their computers to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. The last of these, of course, means that certain personalized services cannot then be provided to that user and accordingly you may not be able to take full advantage of all of EYE OF DUBAI features. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.  
If you have set your computer to reject cookies you can still browse EYE OF DUBAI anonymously until such time as you wish to register for eyeofdubai.com services. 

  
**4\. Use and storage of your personal information**  
When you supply any personal information to eyeofdubai.com (e.g. for competitions, eyeofdubai.com Community services or eyeofdubai.com membership) we have legal obligations towards you in the way we use those data. We must collect the information fairly, that is, we must explain how we will use it (see the notices on particular WebPages that let you know why we are requesting the information) and tell you if we want to pass the information on to anyone else.  
In general, any information you provide to the EYE OF DUBAI will only be used within EYE OF DUBAI and by its agents and service providers. Your information will be disclosed where we are obliged or permitted by law. Also, if you post or send offensive, inappropriate or objectionable content anywhere on or to eyeofdubai.com or otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour on EYE OF DUBAI, EYE OF DUBAI can use whatever information that is available to it about you to stop such behaviour. This may involve informing relevant third parties such as your employer, school e-mail/Internet provider and law enforcement agencies about the content and your behaviour.  
We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as you use the service you have requested, and remove it in the event that the purpose has been met, or, in the case of eyeofdubai.com membership you no longer wish to continue your registration as eyeofdubai.com member. For safety reasons, however, EYE OF DUBAI may store messaging transcript data (including message content, member names, times and dates) arising from the use of eyeofdubai.com Community services such as Connector for a period of six months. Where personal information is held for people who are not yet registered but have taken part in other eyeofdubai.com services (e.g. forums, VIP club), that information will be held as long as is necessary to ensure that the service is run smoothly. We will ensure that all personal information supplied is held securely, in accordance with UAE laws.  
If you are notified on eyeofdubai.com site that your information may be used to allow the EYE OF DUBAI to contact you for "service administration purposes", this means that the EYE OF DUBAI may contact you for a number of purposes related to the service you have signed up for. For example, we may wish to provide you with password reminders or notify you that the particular service has been suspended for maintenance.
