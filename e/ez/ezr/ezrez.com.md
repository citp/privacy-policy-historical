Safe Harbor
ezRez, abides by the privacy principles of the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks as
set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of
data from the European Union.
Effective Date: June 1, 2011
Safe Harbor Privacy Policy
ezRez Software, Inc. (“ezRez”) recognizes that the European Union (“EU”) has an “ominbus”
data protection regime established pursuant to the European Data Protection Directive
(95/46/EC) (the “Directive”) and that Switzerland has adopted a data protection law (together,
“Data Privacy Laws”). Among other things, the Data Privacy Laws generally require “adequate
protection” for the transfer of personally identifiable information about individuals located in
the EU and Switzerland to ezRez’s operations in the United States.


ezRez provides a hosted online travel agency software platform which enables its enterprise
business customers to sell airline flights, hotels, car rentals, and other travel products for cash
and loyalty program points (the “ezRez Service”). In the course of providing the ezRez Service,
ezRez processes its enterprise business customers’ data which includes personal information of
individuals located in the EU and Switzerland who shop for and purchase travel products from
ezRez enterprise business customers via the ezRez Service (“European Travelers” and
“European Traveler Data"). ezRez accordingly adheres to the requirements of the U.S./EU and
U.S./Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Principles published by the U.S. Department of Commerce ("Safe
Harbor") with respect to certain European Traveler Data received in the United States about
European Travelers. ezRez is not responsible for the content of the information it processes,
nor is it responsible for the way its enterprise business customers treat the Personal
Information they collect or control.
Each of our enterprise business customers acts as the data controller for any European Traveler
Data collected in the EU and Switzerland and subsequently transferred to ezRez in the U.S.
ezRez acts as a data processor on behalf of our enterprise business customers with respect to
such European Traveler Data and accordingly only carries out the instructions of such
customers with regard to the collection, processing, and protection of European Traveler Data.
ezRez generally does not collect personal information directly from individuals in the EU. If
ezRez does collect information directly from individuals within the EU via its Website, it will do
so pursuant to its corporate Privacy Policy in accordance with the Safe Harbor.
For more information about Safe Harbor please refer to the U.S. Department of Commerce
website at http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/. European Travelers may first wish to contact
the enterprise business customer with questions regarding European Traveler Data shared with
ezRez, as this may be the most efficient means of addressing such access requests. European
Travelers may email ezRez at privacy@ezrez.com to review the European Traveler Data that
ezRez holds about them. Any European Traveler who cannot resolve his or her issue directly
with the enterprise business customer or ezRez can contact the local data protection authority
for further information and assistance.
If you have any questions about our Safe Harbor participation, please email us at
privacy@ezrez.com.
Effective Date: June 1, 2011
