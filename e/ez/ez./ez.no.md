# Privacy / eZ - ez.no

[eZ](https://web.archive.org/) > Privacy

The privacy of our visitors and customers are important to us. This page will fully disclose what information we collect, why we collect it and how we store it (and sometimes why we don't store it).

## **Log in**

Log ins are private and contain information which lets a user log in to our site, and occasionally also store settings. Every log in needs a working e-mail address.

##  **When do You Need to Log in?**

You need to log in when you want to write comments to articles or entering discussions on [http://share.ez.no](http://share.ez.no/) or when you want to access your eZ Publish Enterprise Service Portal. 

##  **What do We do With Your Addresses?**

We will not sell your private information or in other ways use it for any other purpose than stated.   
We will not release any information about our customers to third party unless required by law, a court order or in instances where a product or service bought through eZ Systems requires that the information be passed to our executor of that service or product or the transporter/shipper of products.

However, if you have filled any form on this site to download files, documents or in order to contact us, you will receive e-mails or newsletters from us or from a local Business Partner but at any time you will be able to unsubscribe so that you do not get those emails any longer. The content of those emails is meant to be interesting and relevant to you based on the forms you have filled out and on the interests that you have communicated to us.
