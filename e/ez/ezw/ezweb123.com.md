# EasyWeb123 - quick and affordable website solutions

**We Value Your Right to Privacy:**   
We value your right to privacy. To better protect your privacy we offer this explanation of our online information practices and how your information is collected and utilized. We make this information easily available on our homepage and on every part of our website(s). 

**The Information We Collect:**   
This privacy statement applies to all information collected or submitted on the Easyweb123 site. On our pages, you can register for information access, request materials, or other methods of follow-up contact. The types of personal information collected at these pages may include: 

  * Name
  * Company
  * Position
  * Email address
  * Address
  * Phone Number
  * Fax Number
  * Industry
  * Current Website URL
  * Project Timeline and/or Budget
  * Optional Demographics (i.e. occupation, gender, etc.)
  * Interest Areas
  * Or other general, non-personally identifiable information



_Note: we make every possible effort to limit the information we obtain for direct marketing of our product to you, and/or servicing your website needs._

**The Way We Use Information:**   
EasyWeb123 is the only owner of the information gathered on this site. We **DO NOT** market this information in any manner to third parties. We do not sell, trade, or otherwise share your information with any outside party. Easyweb123, or its parent company, Internet Strategies, has no intention or desire to engage in such practices. 

**Registration**   
You can register on our website if you would like access to various levels of information and website functionality. During registration, a user is required to give their contact information (such as name and email address). This information will be used to properly set up your account, and is not shared with outside parties. We may also use the contact information to send supplementary product information to you in the future. All such product information will be communicated directly by us, and not any third party. 

**Surveys**   
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include demographic information (such as zip code, age, sex, or industry). Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site and/or Easyweb123 products and services. 

**Send-To-A-Colleague**   
If a user elects to send information from our site directly to a colleague, we ask them for the colleague's name and email address. Easyweb123 will allow you the ability to view and/or edit the information that will be sent before it is delivered. Once approved, the website will instantaneously and automatically send the colleague this one-time email with the requested material (e.g. article, offer, form, etc.) from the site. Easyweb123 does not store this information for future use. 

**Marketing Information**   
If applicable, the marketing and demographic information (such as gender and industry) we collect during information request or registration is optional, but encouraged so that we may gain a better understanding of our users, and so that we may serve them in a more personalized manner. This information is solely for internal use, and will not be shared with outside parties. 

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with strategic partners. For example, we may tell a partner that "X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website", or that "Y percent of our customers are in the manufacturing business", but we would not disclose anything that could be used to personally identify those individuals or their organizations. 

**Our Commitment to Data Security**   
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. 

Where appropriate, all sensitive information is provided in an encrypted environment. This information is protected with the best encryption techniques in the industry, including SSL (Secure Socket Layer). 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our customer service representative) are granted access to customer information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, all critical personally identifiable information (such as credit card information) is kept in a secure **offline** environment. 

**Use of Cookies**   
We may use cookies to enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. 

Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information. Once the user closes his or her browser, the cookie simply terminates. If a user rejects the cookie, he or she may still use our site at the risk that all functionality may not properly operate as intended. 

The following are example of how we use cookies in order to simplify data entry: 

  1. E-mail when logging in. 
  2. Name, e-mail, and account access upon subsequent visits to the website(s). 



**Log Files**   
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. Easyweb123, its parent, Internet Strategies, nor any other online service can obtain personally identifiable information from an IP Address. 

**Links**   
This web site may contain links to and from other sites. Please be aware that Easyweb123 is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites that are not owned by us or our parent company. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this website. 

**How You Can Access or Correct Your Information**   
If you are a registered user, you can access most of your personally identifiable information (name, e-mail, and interest areas) that we collect online through the registration update form. Due to the sensitivity of credit card information, we do not make it available to view online, but it can be viewed by sending e-mail to [questions@easyweb123.com](mailto:questions@easyweb123.com). We will then contact you to determine the best way of confirming this information with you. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections. We use this procedure to better safeguard your information. 

**Opt-Out**   
If at any time you would like your information to be modified or removed from our database, you may contact us directly via e-mail. If you would like to discontinue receiving supplementary information, you may also contact us with your instructions. 

**Notification of Changes**   
In the event that we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our homepage so our users can easily access the latest version. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in a different manner than originally disclosed.
