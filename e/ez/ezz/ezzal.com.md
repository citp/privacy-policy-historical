### The Games / Other Media

To minimise the risk of infringement on any copyright of the games, we have taken a number of measures. Through this page we want to inform our users, or everyone having an interest in this.

  1. We requested and obtained permission for a number of the games from the copyright holders known to us.
  2. Many of the games may be included on any Internet site without any (prerequisite) constraints. For some we could not find any copyright information or due to general use on the Internet, this information can no longer be obtained.
  3. Some games may be used under special conditions, considering a number of prerequisite constraints. These prerequisite constraints are, as far as we could determine, met by ezzal.com.
  4. We do not change anything in the source code of the games. For example, credit holders, brand names, or references to websites remain unchanged.



The legislation around Internet developments and applications is still in full swing, and whatever is/is not allowed is not always obvious and there is room for subjective interpretations. It is therefore possible that, despite our careful and genuine intentions, a copyright holder may still feel that his/her interests are damaged. In such case, we request that you contact us. This can be done via an e-mail to the editors.

If your objection is reasonable i.e. comprehensible, the relevant game will immediately be removed from ezzal.com. Our experience has indicated that this approach works very well.
