**Your Privacy Is Important**

We are anti-spam and will not be renting or revealing your identity to spammers. 

As you notice, we don't make you jump through demographic hoops: we don't ask for your name, address, age, household income, or gender. We don't collect this data. Therefore, we cannot abuse that data. 

Our newsletters are designed to provide you with free content and special offers. Period. 

Your email address is revealed to our third-party mailing list provider: [Topica.com](http://www.topica.com/). They are a great company with a strong anti-spam policy but you may want to review their privacy policy as well. 

In addition, we have an affiliate program that tracks traffic sent from our affiliates' websites. We pay them based on leads (actual subscribers) so you may be tracked by cookies so that we can pay our affiliates for valid leads. Again, your email address isn't revealed to our affiliates but is collected by our third- party affiliate program administrator: [Commission Junction](http://www.cj.com/). They are also a respectable company with a strong anti-spam policy but you may want to review their privacy policy as well. 

Also, we monitor our traffic to determine what search engines, links, and ad campaigns are sending us traffic. Cookies may be involved. We may be tracking your movement on our site to determine what percentage of people from certain ad campaigns and links are actually signing up. This helps us spend our advertising and marketing budget more wisely. Again, none of your information is being collected in a way to be reconciled with your email address. 

We are advertiser-supported so pay attention to banners and links placed on our site and newsletters. We do try to label most of these as "Sponsor." We don't reveal your email address to our advertisers but once you leave our newsletter or site, you are on your own. 

We only want to bring you respectable sponsors but occasionally we participate in ad networks or have ads placed by third-parties to whom we don't know. As such, be prudent and remember the adage: buyer beware. 

Also, we do reserve the right to sell some or all of our newsletters to respectable content providers who agree to provide you with like-minded content. For example, if we agree to sell our freebies' newsletter, we would only sell the email addresses on that newsletter to a respectable company that agrees to send you free content on the subject matter you selected: freebies and free offers. 

Children (defined as those under the age of 13 years old) may not use DayTips without their parent's permission. 

We also reserve the right to change or amend this privacy policy in the future (and if our lawyers make us). 

Advice: Freebies and sweepstakes are not free when you are asked to give away your most valuable asset: your personal data. Play it safe and only provide that information for which you feel comfortable giving.
