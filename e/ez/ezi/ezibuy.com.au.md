We have put in place the following policy to protect your personal information.  By using our website and/or providing information to us, you consent to the policy.

What personal information do we collect?

You may give us information about yourself, such as your name, address, email address and telephone numbers, when, for example, you become an EziBuy member, request a catalogue or make a purchase from us.  If you do not give this information, we may not be able to provide goods or services to you.

When you visit our website we may collect more information, such as the address of your Internet service provider, the name of the web page directing you, and your clicks and activity on our site.

How do we use the personal information?

We may use the information to process your transactions, to administer your account, to conduct credit and other checks, for our own internal purposes (such as risk management, staff training and billing), to help us to develop our website to be more available and user friendly to our customers, and for any other use which you may authorise.

In addition, we may use the information to promote and market our products and services, or the products and services of others.  However, we will not do this by email or text (except as part of an email which facilitates, completes or confirms a transaction with you) unless we have your express, inferred or deemed consent to do so.  These emails and texts will always include an "unsubscribe" facility.  Further, if you do not wish to receive them, you can update your records on our website, call us on 1800 148 148 or email us at [mail@ezibuy.com.au](mailto:mail@ezibuy.com.au).

Will we disclose the information to others?

We do not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others.

However, we do use other companies and individuals to perform services on our behalf, such as delivering packages, sending mail and emails and processing payments.  They will have access to your personal information needed to perform these services, but we will not authorise them to use your information for other purposes.

We also disclose your information to our business partners, such as financial services or insurance companies, for them to offer products and services to you.  This information may include scrambled credit card details, although these will only be used with your consent for any transactions with them.  If you do not wish your information to be disclosed, call us on 1800 148 148 or email us at [mail@ezibuy.com.au](mailto:mail@ezibuy.com.au).

In addition, we may provide statistics with personal identifiers removed about our customers, readers, sales, traffic patterns and related site functions to reputable third parties.

Cookies

Our website uses a technology called cookies.  A cookie is a small element of data that our website may send to your computer.  Any such cookie is typically stored on your computer's hard drive and permits our website to recognise you when you return.  Our use of cookies helps us to provide you with a better experience during your use of our website by allowing us to understand what areas of the site are of interest to you.  You may configure your web browser to not accept cookies, although you may experience a loss of functionality as a result.

Security

We take security seriously, and have taken steps to ensure your personal information is secure.  We use secure servers, and industry standard data encryption whenever we are receiving or transferring your information online.  However, we accept no responsibility for any loss, misuse, unauthorised access or disclosure, alteration or destruction of personal information which you submit to us.

What about links to other websites?

Our website may contain links to other sites that are not under our control.  These websites have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them.  We have no responsibility for linked websites, and provide them solely for your information and convenience.

Updating your personal information

You may obtain confirmation from us as to whether or not we hold personal information about you.  You may also request a copy of the information and/or request that corrections or changes are made to it.  You can make changes to your personal information on our website, by calling us on 1800 148 148 or by emailing us at [mail@ezibuy.com.au](mailto:mail@ezibuy.com.au).

Policy changes

We may review this policy from time to time and will notify you of any changes by posting an updated version on our website.  This document represents our privacy policy as at 09 April 2008.

Feedback

We welcome your questions and comments about privacy at EziBuy.  Please call us on 1800 148 148 or email us at [mail@ezibuy.com.au](mailto:mail@ezibuy.com.au).
