Ezines-R-Us.com
(or EvieB.com) strives
to offer its visitors the many
advantages of Internet technology and to
provide an interactive and
personalized experience. We may use
Personally Identifiable Information
(your name, email address, street
address, telephone number) subject
to the terms of this privacy policy. We will
never sell, barter, or rent your
email address to any unauthorized third
party. Period."
<b>
</b><p><b>How we gather information from users
</b>
How we
collect and store information depends on the page you are

visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the services


provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information when you


register for access to certain portions of our site or request certain features,

such as
newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may provide

information when you participate in sweepstakes and contests, message

boards
and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our site. (If applicable)
<b>
</b></p><p><b>What we do with the information we collect
</b>
Like
other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit
and
deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your
privacy
and do not share your information with anyone.
</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><br>

Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you)

may be
used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about
your
usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help

enhance
our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or

what
features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally

be
shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information

does
not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow

anyone
to identify you individually. <br>
&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">We may
use Personally Identifiable Information collected on Ezines-R-Us.com
(or EvieB.com) to communicate with you about
your registration and
customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy
policy;
services and products offered by Ezines-R-Us.com
(or EvieB.com) and
other topics we think you might find of
interest. <br>
&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Personally Identifiable Information collected by Ezines-R-Us.com (or EvieB.com)

may also be used for other purposes,
including but not limited to site administration,


troubleshooting, processing of
e-commerce transactions, administration of


sweepstakes and contests, and other
communications with you. Certain third


parties who provide technical support for the
operation of our site (our Web


hosting service for example) may access such
information. We will use your


information only as permitted by law. In addition, from
time to time as we


continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge
or partner with


other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user
information may be


among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your
information in response


to a court order, at other times when we believe we are
reasonably required to


do so by law, in connection with the collection of
amounts you may
owe to us,


and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it
appropriate or


necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior
to
disclosure


in such cases.
