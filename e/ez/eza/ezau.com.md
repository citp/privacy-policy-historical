# Privacy Policy

From: Ed Zivkovic 

#### We respect your privacy

We have a strong commitment to safeguarding the privacy of our subscribers. 

We do not share personally identifiable information such as names, email addresses, phone numbers etc to third parties. 

This site gives users the option to receive communication from us via a double opt-in autoresponder system. 

When you enter your name and email address into one of our autoresponder forms, you will receive a confirmation email. 

This confirmation email is a security measure. 

It asks you to click on a link to validate that you are in fact the person who entered your information into the autoresponder form. After you click the security link, you will receive the requested information via email. 

We use an automatic autoresponder subscription service. Any subscriber can opt-out of any campaign at any time by clicking a special un-subscribe link which is available in all autoresponder emails. 

We do not share private information with third parties. 

We use third-party companies to serve ads and collect non-personally identifiable information (e.g., the pages you visit, and which links you click, which ads you see and click on, and the categories of search terms you enter) when you visit our web site. These companies may use the information outlined above (which does not include your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. These companies often use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) (link to the NAI universal user opt-out).
