**4\. Cookies**  
To enhance your experience with the Website, we use "cookies" on our Website. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide features. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering at our Website. However, once you become a customer and furnish the Website with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. 

We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our Website. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our Website (e.g., to recognize you when you return to the Website). With most internet browsers, you can erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information. However, certain areas of the Website can be accessed only in conjunction with cookies or similar devices and you should be aware that disabling cookies or similar devices might prevent you from accessing some of our content. 

The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, and service providers is not covered by our privacy statement. We do/do not have access or control over these cookies. Our partners, affiliates, and service providers use session ID cookies to allow us to improve site navigation and usage. 

**5\. Web Beacons**  
Our third party advertising partners employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information. 

**6\. Children**  
The Website is not directed at individuals less than thirteen (13) years of age, and Ez Texting does not intend to collect any personally-identifiable information from such individuals, unless otherwise stated at the time such information is collected. 

**7\. Information Collected Automatically**  
Ez Texting may also (i) automatically collect non-personally-identifiable information about your use of the Website, such as the domain from which you access the Internet (for example, Comcast.net, if you are connecting from a Comcast account), the date and time you access the Website, and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our Website; and (ii) use data capture and analysis tools, and other similar tools, to extract, compile and analyze any non-personally identifiable data or information resulting from your use of the Website and the services offered thereon (collectively “ _Blind Data_ ”). To the extent that any Blind Data is collected by Ez Texting, such Blind Data shall be solely owned by Ez Texting and may be used by Ez Texting for any lawful business purpose, including, without limitation, analyzing and enhancing the Website and services offered hereby, disclosing such Blind Data to third parties for a variety of purposes.

To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at [info@eztexting.com](mailto:info@eztexting.com).

**10\. Links to Other Websites**  
The Website may contain links to third party websites, whose information practices may be different than Ez Texting’s. Visitors should consult such third-party sites’ privacy notices as Ez Texting does not have any control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties. Ez Texting does not make any representations or warranties as to the security of any information (including, without limitation, credit card and other personal information) you might be requested to give any third party. 

These links are provided solely as a convenience to you and not as an endorsement by Ez Texting of the contents on such third-party websites. Ez Texting cannot ensure that you will be satisfied with any products or services that you purchase from a third-party site that links to or from the Website, since these sites are owned and operated by independent retailers. 

Ez Texting is not responsible for the content of linked third-party sites and does not make any representations regarding the content or accuracy of materials on such third-party sites. Ez Texting has not taken any steps to confirm the accuracy or reliability of any of the information contained in such third-party sites. If you decide to access linked third-party sites, you do so at you own risk. Ez Texting strongly encourages you to make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or off-line transaction with any of these third parties. 

**11\. Data Security Policy**  
The importance of security for all personally-identifiable information associated with visitors to the Website—as well as Ez Texting customer information, such as cell phone numbers, texts, messages, credit card information, and addesses, and other account data—is of utmost concern to Ez Texting, and we have implemented, and periodically review, certain physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help prevent unauthorized access and maintain data security. Your payment and personal information is always safe. Our Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software is the industry standard and among the best software available today for secure commerce transactions. It encrypts all of your personal information, including credit card number, name, and address. Unfortunately, due to the open nature of Internet communications, no data transmission over the Internet can be guarasnteed to be secure, and thus we cannot guarantee that communications between you and Ez Texting will be free from unauthorized access by third parties. Visitors of the Website and Ez Texting customers use the Website at their own risk. 

**12\. Your Acceptance of These Terms**  
By accessing the Website, you signify your assent to the Ez Texting Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not access the Website. You should visit this page periodically, as we may, from time to time, update this Privacy Policy and such changes shall be effectively immediately upon posting on the Website and without further notice to you. Your continued access to the Website following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy shall be deemed an acceptance of such changes by you. Ez Texting will, however, use personally-identifiable information only in accordance with the version of the Privacy Policy under which the information was collected. 

**13\. Changes in This Privacy Policy**  
We may update this privacy statement to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.
