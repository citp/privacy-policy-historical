<p><strong>Privacy Policy&nbsp;</strong><br><br>The following describes the Privacy Policy for our HTTP://EZMONEYMETHOD2X.COM AND &nbsp;HTTP://EZMONEYMETHOD.NET websites.</p>
<p><strong>Your Privacy&nbsp;<br></strong><br>Your privacy is important to us at DAILY INCOME NETWORK, LLC. To better protect your&nbsp;privacy we&nbsp;provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices&nbsp;you can make about the&nbsp;way your information is collected and used. You agree to agree&nbsp;to these policies by virtue of using our&nbsp;website in a way that leads to you providing us with&nbsp;personal information.</p>
<p><strong>State Law &amp; Accompanying Rights&nbsp;<br></strong><br>Please understand that you may have additional rights originating from State laws based&nbsp;on where you&nbsp;live. These State-based rights may augment, strengthen, or otherwise somehow&nbsp;compliment any&nbsp;privacy rights you have inherently or under Federal law. Our policy is to&nbsp;comply fully with the privacy&nbsp;policies of every jurisdiction in which we operate. Accordingly,&nbsp;you are free to use our Contact&nbsp;information to reach us at any time to assert any State rights.</p>
<p><strong>Our Commitment To Children's Privacy&nbsp;</strong><br><br>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, our website&nbsp;will never&nbsp;collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under&nbsp;18, and no part of&nbsp;our website is structured to attract anyone under 18.&nbsp;<br>Under our Terms of Service and Conditions of Use, children under 18 are not allowed to use&nbsp;our website&nbsp;and access our services. It is not our intention to offer products or services to&nbsp;minors.</p>
<p><strong>Collection of Personal Information&nbsp;<br></strong><br>When visiting our website, the IP address used to access our website may be logged along&nbsp;with the&nbsp;dates and times of access. This information is purely used to analyze trends,&nbsp;administer our website,&nbsp;track users movement, and gather broad demographic information&nbsp;for internal use such as statistical&nbsp;assessments and website improvement. Most importantly,any recorded IP addresses are not linked to&nbsp;personally identifiable information.&nbsp;<br><br>Other information may be collected as well by DAILY INCOME NETWORK, LLC, which is rather&nbsp;typical of&nbsp;most websites. For instance, the source that referred you to our website is generally&nbsp;known. Likewise,&nbsp;your duration on our website, and your destination when you leave our website&nbsp;can also be tracked.&nbsp;Other common data collected includes the type of operating system the&nbsp;computer you are using to&nbsp;access our website has. Similarly, the type of web browser is often&nbsp;noted. Again, this is common data&nbsp;collection, and helps ultimately produce a better end-user&nbsp;<br>experience.&nbsp;<br><br>Cookies are another common internet practice. Cookies are a key means of improving user&nbsp;experience&nbsp;by allows us to customize your use of our website. Simple information is transferred&nbsp;to your computer&nbsp;to allow the content and experience at HTTP://EZMONEYMETHOD2X.COM AND&nbsp;HTTP://EZMONEYMETHOD.NET to reflect your actions, preferences, and so on. You should simply&nbsp;make&nbsp;the assumption our website uses cookies, and note that you are free to make adjustments in&nbsp;your web&nbsp;browser to disable these or otherwise receive notification of cookies so you can take&nbsp;whatever desired&nbsp;action you so choose. Please understand that refusing cookies may cripple&nbsp;some of our website features&nbsp;and render some aspects useless to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At times, you will be fully aware of information received, as you are the direct source providing it.&nbsp;For&nbsp;instance, you may comment on a blog post, reply to an email (whether broadcast message or&nbsp;autoresponder), provide an email address, complete a survey, requests SMS, or otherwise. Likewise,&nbsp;purchases necessarily involve collecting certain information, such as credit card information, Paypal&nbsp;addresses, your physical address for billing and/or shipping, phone number, and so on. Refusing to&nbsp;provide some of this information may lead to us being unable to provide you with the products or&nbsp;services you’ve requested.&nbsp;<br><br>A prime example of limited access to our website is where some HTTP://EZMONEYMETHOD2X.COM&nbsp;AND HTTP://EZMONEYMETHOD.NET content may be protected by a username and password. Whether&nbsp;a username and password is generated by our website, or created by you, these will almost always be&nbsp;connected with some other information related to or connected with you. This is true since much&nbsp;content that is protected on the internet is subscription based, often paid for. Thus, the username&nbsp;and&nbsp;password must necessarily be tied to your other account data. Usernames and passwords, by&nbsp;their very&nbsp;nature, should be kept private.</p>
<p><strong>Handling of Personal Information&nbsp;<br></strong><br>Note that any personal information you provide to others apart from us or our vendors is wholly&nbsp;optional. As an example, you might disclose something in a blog post comment. That “private”&nbsp;information is now “public,” and we have no control over that. In like fashion, you sharing&nbsp;information&nbsp;with any other third party not functioning as a service provider to us puts that&nbsp;information beyond our&nbsp;control and becomes subject to the policy that party has in place.&nbsp;<br><br>Our primary intention for collecting personal and private information from you is simply to conduct&nbsp;our&nbsp;business. We can use this internally to better serve you. Accordingly, we see no reason to share&nbsp;your&nbsp;personal information to other parties and outside interests unless you have authorized us to&nbsp;do so. Of&nbsp;course, there are instances where your information is stored with third party service&nbsp;providers, such as&nbsp;email service providers, as they provide services that are industry-leading in&nbsp;quality and security and are&nbsp;far more beneficial to our end user than attempting such services&nbsp;“in-house.” However, you are never&nbsp;required to deal with any such third party directly, they are&nbsp;limited in how they use your information,&nbsp;and they cannot sell or transfer it to others in any way.&nbsp;<br><br>However, of course, your information does comprise part of an overall whole. This aggregate of&nbsp;information, by contrast, may be used to understand our overall user base. Further, we may&nbsp;share this&nbsp;information about our website visitors as a whole, not individually, with third parties&nbsp;for various&nbsp;purposes, in our sole discretion.</p>
<p>While we are staunch privacy advocates at DAILY INCOME NETWORK, LLC, there are times when&nbsp;even&nbsp;we may be forced to abandon these ideals. Just as major search engines face ongoing&nbsp;compulsion to&nbsp;provide data against their will, so too may the same occur with our&nbsp;HTTP://EZMONEYMETHOD2X.COM&nbsp;AND HTTP://EZMONEYMETHOD.NET website. Illegal activity&nbsp;or other serious acts or allegations could&nbsp;create legal liability for our website. In those cases,&nbsp;we reserve the right to share your information, or&nbsp;else may simply be compelled to do so by&nbsp;<br>law. On the other hand, there may be times when we would&nbsp;need to share your private&nbsp;information in order to protect our own interests. For instance, in cases of&nbsp;suspected or alleged&nbsp;copyright infringement or other intellectual property violations, it may be&nbsp;necessary to share&nbsp;personal information.</p>
