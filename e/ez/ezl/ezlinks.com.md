The EZLinks Platforms may contain content served by third parties, including videos and advertisements, and we work with third party service providers to serve EZLinks advertisements elsewhere online. In connection with serving content and providing analytics and advertising services, third parties may collect certain information about your visits to this or other web sites and we may receive information regarding the use of the EZLinks Platforms and the effectiveness of our advertisements. These advertising networks, advertisers, ad agencies, analytics service providers and other vendors may set and access their own tracking devices (including cookies and web beacons) and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you and your online browsing activities.

Some of these companies are members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") or the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising.

The EZLinks Platforms may contain features that enable interaction between you, the EZLinks Platforms and third party platforms and features. Click here for further details. 

######  INFORMATION COLLECTION 

######  1\. Registration and Other Information You Provide 

The EZLinks Platforms may collect "Personal Information" (information that identifies you as a specific individual, such as your full name or e-mail address), account information (password or other information that helps us confirm that it is you accessing your account) and demographic or other information (such as your zip code and information about your interests and preferences). We will also collect payment information if you choose to purchase products or services through the EZLinks Platforms. We may also collect information, including Personal Information, about other members of your golfing party which you may submit to us when you use the EZLinks Platforms. If we combine demographic or similar information with the Personal Information we collect, we will treat it as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. 

Our services are general audience services and are not intended for individuals younger than the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from individuals younger than the age of 13. If EZLinks discovers that it has inadvertently collected personal information from anyone younger than the age of 13, it will delete that information. In addition, you must be at least 18 years of age to make a purchase through the EZLinks Platforms. 

######  2\. Information Third Parties Provide About You 

We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, someone may provide information about you in order to reserve a golf tee time on your behalf or to send you information or a gift card through the EZLinks Platforms. We may combine this information in our database and we may use it to contact you about a reserved tee time or other product purchased for you, or to offer you products or services, or for similar purposes. Third parties also may forward your information to us; for example, if you are using a service that uses the EZLinks Platforms or an EZLinks application program interface (API) to present available golf tee times. We also may supplement the information we collect with outside records from third parties. If we combine the information we receive from others with information we collect through the EZLinks Platforms, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information. 

The EZLinks Platforms may permit you to interact with a third party site or service, such as enabling you to "like" us on another site or "share" content from an EZLinks Platform with other sites. If you choose to "like" or "share" content or to otherwise post information from or via the EZLinks Platforms to a third party site or service, that information may be publicly displayed, and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of the EZLinks Platforms. Similarly, if you interact with us through a third party site, we may have access to information about you (for example, if you "like" or "follow" our page on a third party site). 

You may also choose to use a social media tool offered by a third party, but available on an EZLinks Platform (such as posting a review or logging into the EZLinks Platforms with your username and password for another site). Use of such a feature may allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including Personal Information. When you choose to use a social media tool available on an EZLinks Platform, you may be opting to link your activities on the EZLinks Platform with a third party site or service. That third party may collect information about your visits to the EZLinks Platforms and may publish that activity to your profile or similar feature on that third party site (such as if you choose to share one of your golf course reviews from the EZLinks Platforms with your connections on the third party site). The information we collect is subject to this Privacy Policy. The information collected and stored by the third party remains subject to the third party's privacy practices, including whether the third party continues to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices with regard to what is visible to others on that third party site. 

######  4\. Public Forums and User Content 

The EZLinks Platforms may provide features through which you can publicly post content (comments, golf scores, messages, images, videos, text or other material). If you post any content through the EZLinks Platforms or otherwise submit any content to EZLinks, you grant to us a license as set forth in the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-and-conditions). 

Note that anything you post publicly may be viewed by others. If you choose to voluntarily disclose Personal Information or other information publicly, that information will be considered public information and the protections of this Privacy Policy will not apply. 

######  5\. Information We Collect Automatically 

EZLinks, and our third party service providers (including analytics providers and third party content providers), may automatically collect certain "Usage Information" whenever you visit or interact with the EZLinks Platforms. "Usage Information" typically includes the browser and operating system you may be using, the URL or advertisement that referred you to the EZLinks Platforms (if applicable), the search terms you entered into a search engine that lead you to the EZLinks Platforms (if applicable), all of the areas within the EZLinks Platforms that you visit, and the time of day you used the EZLinks Platform, among other information relating to your use of the EZLinks Platforms. We may use Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including analyzing and improving the EZLinks Platforms and products, to provide special offers, and to select appropriate content to display to you. 

In addition, we automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier ("Device Identifier") for any computer, mobile phone or tablet, or other device you may use to access the EZLinks Platforms. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned or connected to the device you use to access a Service, and our servers identify your device by its Device Identifier. Some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third party service providers with information regarding the physical location of the device used to access a Service. Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if we associate it with you as a specific and identifiable person, we treat it as Personal Information. 

######  6\. Cookies and Similar Technologies

######  THIRD PARTY AD NETWORKS AND ANALYTICS PROVIDERS

For example, if you clicked on one of our advertisements that led you to the EZLinks Platform, our service provider(s) may be able to tell us which advertisement you clicked on and where you were viewing the advertisement. In connection with serving content and providing analytics and advertisement services, third parties may collect certain information about your visits to the EZLinks Platforms or other web sites.

We may share Device Identifier and Usage Information about visitors with third party advertising companies, analytics providers and other vendors for similar purposes.
