Select information provided or otherwise collected will be maintained in your customer profile ("Account") which you may edit at any time by accessing your profile in the Account Information section of the EZLinks Platforms. That information includes:

**General Contact Information:** To create your Account and to fulfill transactions on the EZLinks Platforms, we require that you submit certain contact information for ease of communication throughout your use of the EZLinks Platforms. Such information may include name, address, phone number, email address, date of birth, and gender.

**Payment Information:** We will also facilitate the collection of payment information from you in the form of a credit card number when you conduct a transaction on the EZLinks Platforms, or reserve a round of golf at a Partner Course. Payment information is encrypted, transferred and stored as a token at a third-party processor to ensure the security of data. Payment tokens may be provided to a Partner Course in the event that the Partner Course is required to charge you in accordance with their no-show policy. By providing payment information and completing the transaction, you consent to the use of this payment information by EZLinks and third-parties for the sole purpose of facilitating transactions (eg: purchases, refunds) and to support the facilitation of EZLinks Terms and Conditions and Sales Policies including applicable Partner Course policies including but not limited to the facilitation of No Show charges.

**Records of your contact with us:** In addition to Account and Payment information, we also maintain certain information about your usage of the EZLinks Platforms, your contact with us, and your ordering history. This information is maintained to better serve your individual needs, to facilitate a smoother search and transaction process, to audit and investigate site use, and to help us better deliver an experience catered to your needs. Such information may include: past purchases made through the EZLinks Platforms (courses played, etc.); usage of the EZLinks Platforms and marketing information (whether you open or click on links, search history); information on your IP address or geo-location if activated to allow us to better customize relevant content (eg: local tee times; geo-located offers); and other data to help us better personalize your experience on the EZLinks Platforms and marketing.

**Information You Provide:** The EZLinks Platforms may provide features through which you can publicly post content (comments, reviews, golf scores, messages, images, videos, text or other material). Note that anything you post publicly or submit directly may be viewed by others. If you choose to voluntarily disclose personal information or other information publicly, that information will be considered public information and the protections of this Privacy Policy will not apply. Additionally, we will maintain information that you voluntarily provide to us, whether as part of publicly posted content or not. Some of this information may have to do with your golfing behavior and preferences and will be maintained by us to provide you with a better experience and more pertinent offers. Such information could include: reviews of golf courses you have played; scoring; courses played; preferred brands of clubs and golf balls, etc.

**Information from other Users:** We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, someone may provide information about you in order to reserve a golf tee time on your behalf or to send you information or a gift card through the EZLinks Platforms. We may combine this information in our database and we may use it to contact you about a reserved tee time or other product purchased for you, or to offer you products or services, or for similar purposes. Third parties also may forward your information to us; for example, if you are using a service that uses the EZLinks Platforms or an EZLinks application program interface (API) to present available golf tee times. If we combine the information we receive from others with information we collect through the EZLinks Platforms, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information.

**Behavioral Information We Collect Automatically**

In addition, we automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier ("Device Identifier") for any computer, mobile phone or tablet, or other device you may use to access the EZLinks Platforms. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned or connected to the device you use to access a service, and our servers identify your device by its Device Identifier. We may collect information about your mobile device, including, for example, the hardware model, operating system and version, software, preferred language, advertising identifiers, serial number, device motion information, and mobile network information. Some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third-party service providers with information regarding the physical location of the device used to access a service (i.e., GPS information). Usage information is generally non-identifying, but if we associate it with you as a specific and identifiable person, we treat it as personal information.

Information may also be shared with third-party marketing partners and services to support EZLinks and third-party marketing efforts and analysis.

**Fulfillment of Transaction (Partner Course)**  
In the event you conduct a transaction through the EZLinks Platforms, we will share your information with the facility or third party that will fulfill your purchase (usually, a golf course). The primary piece of information used to identify you when you purchase a round of golf will be your email address, which will be shared with the golf course. Your use of the EZLinks Platforms confirms your consent for EZLinks and the Partner Course to use your email address for future golf marketing initiatives. You may unsubscribe from such EZLinks messages at any time by utilizing the unsubscribe feature in every email.

If you choose to interact with another site via any of the EZLinks Platforms (e.g., sharing content or otherwise posting information from or via the EZLinks Platforms to a third-party site or service), that information may be publicly displayed, and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of the EZLinks Platforms. Similarly, if you interact with us through a third-party site, we may have access to information about you (for example, if you "like" or "follow" our page on a third-party site). When you choose to interact with a third-party site or service, that third party may collect information about your visits to the EZLinks Platforms and may publish that activity to your profile or similar feature on that third-party site (such as if you choose to share one of your golf course reviews from the EZLinks Platforms with your connections on the third-party site). The information collected and stored by the third party remains subject to the third party's privacy practices, including whether the third party continues to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices with regard to what is visible to others on that third-party site.

We may share the personal information we collect through the EZLinks Platforms with our subsidiaries and affiliates, and our vendors and partners, including marketing alliance partners and the golf courses at which you - or a friend on your behalf - reserve tee times using the EZLinks Platforms. In addition, we also may share the information described above in connection with a business transfer, such as to another company that may purchase all or substantially all of the assets we use to provide the EZLinks Platforms to you (this includes disclosure during the due diligence process). We may share both personal and non-personal Information 

_for legal reasons_
