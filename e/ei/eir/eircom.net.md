If you are a new Customer on or after 30th of November 2016 or if you are an existing Customer who enters into a new contract with eir on or after 30th of November 2016 please note if you allow your account to fall into arrears by not paying your bills in full and on time, information on your payment performance may be shared with other service providers of landline, broadband and mobile services through the provision of the information to a database operated by the service providers called Credit Insights.

Other providers of services who also supply information on payment performance of their customers to the Credit Insights database may check this information when you apply for their services in the future to help them assess your credit worthiness. The information shared with Credit Insights includes name, address, date of birth, account details to include account history and balance owed, and will be held on the database for 6 years from the date of the notification of the arrears.

Where you apply to us for post-pay services, we may make searches about you on the Credit Insights database to help us to decide whether to accept your application.
