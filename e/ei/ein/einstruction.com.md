# eInstruction - Privacy Policy

eInstruction has created this privacy statement to demonstrate our commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for all eInstruction websites.

  * Information Collected by eInstruction®
  * Security
  * Supplemental Information
  * Choice/Opt-Out
  * Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)
  * Contacting the Website



**Information Collected by eInstruction**  
Our Website's registration form may require users to give us contact information (such as their name and email address), unique identifiers (such as their social security number), financial information (such as their account or credit card numbers), and demographic information (such as their zip code, age, or income level).

We use customer contact information from the registration form to send the user information about our company and our products. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving information; see the Choice/Opt-out section below.

Unique identifiers (such as social security numbers) are collected to verify the user's identity. Demographic and profile data may also be collected at our Website. We use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our Website, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences.

We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Website.

We will not disclose collected information to any organization outside eInstruction.

**Security**  
This Website has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. The servers are located in a secure environment and access to sensitive data is provided to authorized individuals only.

**Supplemental Information**   
This Website may supplement the information that you provide with information that is received from third parties.

**Choice/Opt-Out**  
Our Website provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us at the point where we request information about the visitor. We will implement requested changes within ten days of the receipt of a request. In addition, visitors may contact us at anytime by:

  * Sending an email to: [SUPPORT@EINSTRUCTION.COM](maito:support@einstruction.com)

**Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)**  
If you use the ExamView Internet test-hosting feature, please be aware of the following privacy issue.

If you create a test with a class roster, you will see that we have provided space for your students' names, IDs, and email addresses. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act precludes us from requesting and collecting any information that would allow someone to identify or contact a student who is under the age of 13 (e.g., full name, home address, email address, telephone number, and so on).

Accordingly, FOR STUDENTS UNDER THE AGE OF 13, please **DO NOT** provide us with the student's real name, email address, or any ID number that a third party might be able to associate with the student (e.g., social security number). Instead, we require that you use a code number or user ID for each of your students that you have contrived and that could not be used by someone else to identify that student.

Your access to the Internet test-hosting service is conditioned upon your agreement to comply with this requirement. Your use of the service will constitute your agreement to comply and to hold us harmless from any cost or damage we might suffer as a consequence of your failure to do so.
