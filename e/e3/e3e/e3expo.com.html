<b>Privacy Policy</b><p>

The E<sup>3</sup> Web site is designed to provide a convenient means for you to obtain information about the Electronic Entertainment Expo and to register for this event.</p><p>  

There are two occasions when E<sup>3</sup> may ask you provide Personal Information including name, title, company, address, phone and fax number,  email address, as well as some demographic information such as Job Function, Product Interests, Primary Business and Purchase Involvement.</p><p>

When you register for the Electronic Entertainment Expo, you are required to provide Personal Information as well as demographic information;  this information is required to process your registration. Your registration will not be processed unless the required fields have been completed.  These fields include: name, street address, city, state, zip code.  It is also required that you complete the demographic questions in order for your registration to be processed.</p><p>

At other areas of the Web site, you may provide your Personal Information on a voluntary basis in order to receive email updates about the event or join the mailing list.</p><p>  

In addition, the E<sup>3</sup> Web server collects the domain names of the visitors that come to our site.  This information is collected to measure the number of visits, the amount of time spent on the E<sup>3</sup> site, how many pages were viewed, etc. and this information may be distributed to E<sup>3</sup> exhibitors for advertising purposes. E<sup>3</sup> tracks only the domain names from which a visitor has come to the site;  no Personal Information is captured -- the user remains anonymous.</p><p>

Your Personal Information is collected by E<sup>3</sup> Show Management and the online registration system provided by RCS. Whenever your Personal Information is collected, it is collected using standard SSL encryption. E<sup>3</sup> is committed to ensuring the security of your Personal Information and to ensuring that it is not misused.</p><p>

The Personal Information that we collect is used to process your registration or may be used by E<sup>3</sup> for marketing and promotional purposes to keep you informed with the latest news about the event.  This information may be shared with third parties only through a bonded mail house.  A bonded mail house is a secure means to share your information with third parties who have been pre-screened by E<sup>3</sup>.  A sample of the material a third party is mailing to the E<sup>3</sup> list is obtained and  reviewed prior to releasing the E<sup>3</sup> list to a bonded mailhouse.    A bonded mail house limits use of the E<sup>3</sup> list to a one-time use and ensures the confidentiality of your Personal Information.  It ensures that the third party never actually views your Personal Information until and unless you respond to their mailing.  If you respond to a third party's mailing, you then become part of the third party's database and the third party may then use your personal information for its own promotional purposes.</p><p>

Third parties with whom your information may be shared  include E<sup>3</sup> exhibitors with whom E<sup>3</sup> has established a business relationship.  Your Personal Information may also be shared with other third parties who have been screened by E<sup>3</sup> and the E<sup>3</sup> List Manager, IDG List Services.  This may include trade publications or newsletter services.  Your Personal Information will not be shared with any company that competes with E<sup>3</sup> and its exhibitors.</p><p> 

If you have provided E<sup>3</sup> with your Personal Information, you will receive promotional pieces about the event in the mail, by fax or via email.  If, at any time, you decide you do not wish to receive further information about E<sup>3</sup>, you may remove yourself from the email or mailing list by returning the promotional piece with the word "remove". E<sup>3</sup> continually updates its mailing and email lists and your name will be promptly removed.</p><p>

When you receive promotional information from E<sup>3</sup>, you may change any incorrect Personal Information and notify E<sup>3</sup> by returning the piece with the corrected information.  This information will be corrected immediately.</p><p> 

If you have concerns with how your information is being used, you may contact E<sup>3</sup> Customer Service at 800-315-1133 or the E<sup>3</sup> webmaster at webmaster@E<sup>3</sup>expo.com.  You may also contact Customer Service at any time to review the information that E<sup>3</sup> has collected from you via the registration system.</p><p>

E<sup>3</sup> maintains web links with its partners in the industry. However, E<sup>3</sup> is not responsible for the content or the privacy practices of these sites.</p><p>

E<sup>3</sup> may change or modify portions of this policy at any time.  We will inform you of these changes with a notice on the E<sup>3</sup> home page, but encourage you to refer back to this page.  If you have any questions or concerns regarding the E<sup>3</sup> Privacy Policy, please email us at webmaster@E<sup>3</sup>expo.com.</p><p><br>
