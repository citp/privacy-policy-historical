85 Broads Unlimited LLC dba Ellevate Network (“Ellevate”, “our”, “us” or “we”) provides this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) to describe how we use and process certain information that we obtain through the web site at www.ellevatenetwork.com (the “Site”). We invite all visitors to, or users of, the Site (“You”) to carefully review this Privacy Policy before continuing to access or use the Site.

We collect certain personally identifiable data that You submit through the Site (“Personal Data”) as well as other non-personally identifiable data that we collect through cookies and other tracking technologies (“Data”) in order for us to understand Your needs better and make Your experience at the Site more valuable to You. We may share this Personal Data and Data with our affiliates and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy. They may also combine it with other information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising. You are not required to provide the Personal Data that we have requested, but, if You chose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide You with our products or services or respond to any queries You may have.

You may sign up for membership, post articles, network with others or otherwise actively send us Personal Data using the Site. “Personal Data” includes, but is not limited to, Your name, email address(es), billing address(es), delivery address(es), telephone number(s), contact preferences and credit card information. Personal Data may also include Your education and work history and other skills and characteristics related to Your past, current or future occupational endeavors. You can amend or update Your Ellevate profile at any time and You can close such profile at any time. We use Personal Data primarily for the purpose for which You originally provided it (for example, to receive access to member events, to network with others, or the like), and for purposes of improving our products and services and for market research. We may use Personal Data to transmit direct marketing communications to You by email.

This Site is not intended for use by persons under the age of thirteen. Individuals who are under the age of thirteen are expressly prohibited from submitting to Ellevate or posting to the Site any personally identifiable information about themselves.

Specifically, but without limitation, we reserve the right to disclose such information when a Member is in violation of our Terms of Use or other published guidelines, or partakes (or is reasonably suspected of partaking) in any harmful, infringing or illegal activity, even without a subpoena, warrant, or other court order.
