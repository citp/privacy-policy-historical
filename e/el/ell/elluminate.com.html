                </p>

                </p>
                <p class="indented">In addition, we may collect personal information (such as your name, email address, company, title,  organization type and, where applicable, payment details) when you fill out a form on our website (e.g. to sign up for our email list; register with for a live demonstration; register for a live event; attend a session), when you use our <i>My Elluminate facility</i>, when you use the 'contact us' portion of the website, when you register to use, or are registered by an organization to enable you to use, our services.

                <p class="indented">Where you request information from us, we may use the email address that you provide to send you information about offers on products and services that we believe may be of interest to you.

                </p>

                <h4>How Do We Use Cookies?</h4>
                <p class="indented">When you visit the website, we place a "cookie" on the hard drive of your computer to track your visit.

The cookie allows us to track your visit to the website so that we can better understand your use of our website so that we can customize and tailor the website to better meet your needs.
                </p>
                <p class="indented">Most web browsers are set to accept cookies.  However, on most web browsers you may change this setting to have your web browser either: (1) notify you prior to a website placing a cookie on your hard drive so that you can decide whether or not to accept the cookie; or (2) automatically prevent the placing of a cookie on your hard drive.  It should be noted that if cookies are not accepted, you will not be able to access a number of web pages found on the website.

                <div class="indented">
                    <ul class="small-ul">

                <div class="indented">
                    <ul class="small-ul">

                        <li>with your consent.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p class="indented space-before">We may collect, use or disclose your personal information without your knowledge or consent where we are permitted or required by applicable law or regulatory requirements to do so.
                </p>


                <h4>Your Consent is Important to Us</h4>
                <p class="indented">By using our website, we assume that you have consented to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as explained in this Privacy Policy.
                </p>
                <p class="indented">You may change or withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice, by contacting our Privacy Officer using the contact information set out below.  In some circumstances, a change in or withdrawal of consent may severely limit our ability to provide products or services to you.  All communications with respect to such withdrawal or variation of consent should be in writing and addressed to our Privacy Officer.

                <p class="indented">We assume that, unless you advise us otherwise, that you have consented to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as explained in this Privacy Policy.

                <h4>How is Your Personal Information Protected?</h4>
                <p class="indented">Elluminate endeavors to maintain physical, technical and procedural safeguards that are appropriate to the sensitivity of the personal information in question.  These safeguards are designed to prevent your personal information from loss and unauthorized access, copying, use, modification or disclosure.
                </p>
                <p class="indented">Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  As a result, while this website strives to protect your personal information, we cannot warrant the confidentiality or security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.
                </p>

                <h4>Updating Your Personal Information</h4>
                <p class="indented">It is important that the information contained in our records is both accurate and current.  If your personal information happens to change during the course of our relationship, please keep us informed of such changes.
                </p>
                <p class="indented">In some circumstances we may not agree with your request to change your personal information and will instead append an alternative text to the record in question.
                </p>

                <h4>Access to Your Personal Information</h4>
                <p class="indented">You can ask to see the personal information that we hold about you.

                </p>
                <p class="indented">When requesting access to your personal information, please note that we may request specific information from you to enable us to confirm your identity and right to access, as well as to search for and provide you with the personal information that we hold about you.  We may charge you a fee to access your personal information; however, we will advise you of any fee in advance.  If you require assistance in preparing your request, please contact our Privacy Officer.
                </p>
                <p class="indented">Your right to access the personal information that we hold about you is not absolute.  There are instances where applicable law or regulatory requirements allow or require us to refuse to provide some or all of the personal information that we hold about you.  In addition, the personal information may have been destroyed, erased or made anonymous in accordance with our record retention obligations and practices.
                </p>
                <p class="indented">In the event that we cannot provide you with access to your personal information, we will endeavour to inform you of the reasons why, subject to any legal or regulatory restrictions.
