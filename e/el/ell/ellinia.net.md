>  **Our Commitment To Privacy**
> 
> Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available from every page where personally identifiable information may be requested.
> 
> **The Information We Collect:**
> 
> This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Ellinia website. On some pages, you can make donations, make requests, and register to receive materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages are:
> 
> Email Address  
>  IP Information  
>  Personal Information
> 
> **The Way We Use Information**
> 
> We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary when the law requires us to comply.
> 
> We use email addresses to answer the emails we receive, to verify upon registration, to send opt-in only contacts such as thread subscriptions and PM notifications. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.
> 
> We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.
> 
> **Advertising**
> 
> We also use third party advertisements support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example), showing certain ads based on specific sites visited or provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites). If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please see: <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>
> 
> Our website contains some affiliate marketing links, which means we get paid commission on sales of those products or services we write about. Our editorial content is not influenced by advertisers or affiliate partnerships. We use a 3rd Party to enable these affiliate partnerships. You can read their Privacy Policy and find more information on the cookies they use.
> 
> Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
> 
> **Our Commitment To Data Security**
> 
> To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
> 
> **Our Commitment To Children's Privacy**
> 
> Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13. Upon registration all children under 13 are denied.

> **Public Shaming Policy**

You have been warned.**
