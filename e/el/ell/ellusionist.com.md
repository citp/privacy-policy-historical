### **What personal information does Ellusionist collect?**

The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve Ellusionist's shopping and community experience. Here are the types of information we gather.

**Information You Give Us** : We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give while registering and account or placing an order.  You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our site, and communicating with you.

**Automatic Information** : We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses our site.

**Mobile** : When you download or use apps created by Ellusionist, we may receive information about your location and your mobile device, including a unique identifier for your device. We may use this information to validate the mobile app purchases, and/or provide updates and notifications. Most mobile devices allow you to turn off location services.

**E-mail Communications** : To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail if your computer supports such capabilities. We use this information to gather information that allows us to improve our communications to our customers. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your preferences in your account (if you have one) or click the 'unsubscribe' link found at the bottom of all non-order related emails .

### **What About Cookies?**

Cookies are unique identifiers that we transfer to your device to enable our systems to recognize your device and to provide valuable features which can enhance the use of our site, most importantly pertaining to the storage of items in your Shopping Cart between visits.

The Help feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Web site of its manufacturer. Because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of our essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, or use any product or service that require you to Log In.

### **Do We Share the Information We Receive?**

Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only as described below.

**Third-Party Service Providers** : We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.

**Protection of Ellusionist and Others** : We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Ellusionist, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice.

With Your Consent: Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.

It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. 

### **Which Information Can I Access?**

We give you access to a broad range of information about your account and in certain cases, updating that information. 

### **What Choices Do I Have?**

As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to make a purchase or to take advantage of features that are important to the use of our site.

When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records.

This will not prevent order confirmation/shipping or other order/product related information that we may need to send to you as a part of our ensuring you have access to complete and up to date information. (If you do not want to receive emails from us, it is your responsibility to review our conditions of use and privacy policy for changes.)

If you do not want us to use personal information that we gather to allow third parties to personalize advertisements we display to you, please adjust your decline the cookie notice shown to you when you visit our site.

In the event of such a request, we will retain only information necessary for record keeping and customer service for past transactions.
