### Security of Personal Data

Ellucian is committed to safeguarding the Personal Data that it receives. While Ellucian cannot guarantee the security of Personal Data, Ellucian has implemented reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data in Ellucian’s possession from loss, misappropriation and unauthorized access, disclosure and destruction.

Ellucian utilizes a combination of online and offline security technologies, procedures and organizational measures to help safeguard Personal Data. For example, facility security is designed to prevent unauthorized access to Ellucian computers. Electronic security measures — including, for example, network access controls, passwords and access logging — provide protection from hacking and other unauthorized access. Ellucian also protects Personal Data through the use of firewalls, role-based restrictions and, where appropriate, encryption technology. Ellucian limits access to Personal Data to employees, subcontractors, and third-party agents that have a specific business reason for accessing such Personal Data. Individuals who have been granted access to Personal Data will be made aware of their responsibilities to protect such information and will be provided training and instruction on how to do so.

If Ellucian learns of an unauthorized disclosure of Personal Data that is within Ellucian’s possession or control, Ellucian will perform all actions required by applicable laws, including taking prompt measures to remedy the unauthorized disclosure and providing required notices.

Ellucian hires other companies to provide certain services on our behalf; for example, to process event registrations. Ellucian will provide these companies only with the information they need to deliver the services, and they are contractually prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

Because Ellucian is a global company, Personal Data may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Ellucian and its affiliates and agents maintain facilities or personnel. 

Ellucian’s products and services are not intended for children under the age of 13. Ellucian does not knowingly collect any information from children. If we learn that we have collected or received Personal Data from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information.

Under certain circumstances, we may be required to disclose your Personal Data in response to valid requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

Ellucian offers product solutions to its customers to store and manage their electronic documents, document metadata, and data relevant to managing an institution of higher education. Ellucian is a global organization and may provide product development services, solution engineering services, professional technical services and product technical support services to its customers from any country in which Ellucian has facilities or personnel.

Ellucian’s customers may choose to include Personal Data with the customer data provided to Ellucian. This Personal Data may include employee name and contact details for the purpose of administering the customer’s account with Ellucian.

Ellucian processes Personal Data that its customers have chosen to share with Ellucian. Ellucian has no direct or contractual relationship with the subjects of this Personal Data (the “Customer Data Subjects”). As a result, when customer data includes Personal Data, the customer is solely responsible for satisfying all legal obligations owed directly to Customer Data Subjects under applicable data protection laws.

It is the Ellucian customer's responsibility to ensure that Personal Data it collects or directs Ellucian to collect can be legally collected. The customer also is responsible for providing to Customer Data Subjects any notices required by applicable law and for responding appropriately to Customer Data Subjects’ requests to exercise their rights with respect to Personal Data. In addition, the customer is responsible for ensuring that its disclosure of Personal Data to Ellucian is consistent with any privacy policy the customer has established and any notices it has provided or is required to provide to Customer Data Subjects.

### Sharing of Personal Data with Third-Parties

Ellucian shares Personal Data with our subcontractors, business partners and third-party agents and contractors only to the extent required in order to deliver products or services requested by customers. Before transferring Personal Data to these third-parties, Ellucian will obtain assurances from the recipient that it will safeguard Personal Data in a manner consistent with this Privacy Statement and otherwise to support Ellucian business activities. If Ellucian learns that a recipient is using or disclosing Personal Data in a manner contrary to this Privacy Statement, Ellucian will take steps to prevent such use or disclosure.

Ellucian also may disclose Personal Data as required by law, for example, in response to a court order, an administrative proceeding or subpoena.

## People in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or Switzerland

The EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks (collectively, “Privacy Shield”) governs how Ellucian collects, uses, and discloses Personal Data that we receive in the United States (“U.S.”) from the EEA and Switzerland. In this Privacy Statement we refer to Personal Data from the EEA or Switzerland as “EEA or Swiss Data”. 

Ellucian collects EEA or Swiss Data (i) from individuals who visit our Site, and (ii) from our customers, vendors, contractors and agents, including the following specific types of information:

  * Contact information, including name, address, email address and phone number
  * Student records provided by Ellucian’s higher education customers
  * Professional and employment information
  * Financial information
  * Identification information, including driver’s license and passport numbers



Ellucian recognizes that the EEA and Switzerland have established strict protections regarding the handling of EEA or Swiss Data, including requirements to provide adequate protection for EEA or Swiss Data transferred outside of the EEA and Switzerland. 

To provide adequate protection for certain EEA or Swiss Data relating to website visitors, customers, prospective customers, partners, vendors, third-party suppliers and contractors that Ellucian receives in the U.S., Ellucian complies with the Privacy Shield as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data transferred from the EEA and Switzerland to the U.S. Ellucian has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield. Ellucian adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Statement and the Privacy Shield, the Privacy Shield shall govern.

Ellucian will only process EEA or Swiss Data in ways that are compatible with the purpose for which Ellucian collected the EEA or Swiss Data, or for purposes that the individual or entity providing the EEA or Swiss Data later authorizes. Before we use your EEA or Swiss Data for a purpose that is materially different than the purpose for which it was collected or that you later authorized, we will provide you with the opportunity to opt out. Ellucian maintains reasonable procedures to help ensure that EEA or Swiss Data is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.

We may collect, or our customers may provide to us when using Ellucian services, certain EEA or Swiss Data that is regarded as “sensitive,” including data concerning racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, ideological views or activities, trade-union membership, administrative or criminal proceedings/sanctions, information on social security measures, or data concerning health or sex life. When we directly collect sensitive EEA or Swiss Data, we will obtain opt-in consent where the Privacy Shield requires, including if we disclose sensitive EEA or Swiss Data to third-parties, or before we use sensitive EEA or Swiss Data for a different purpose than we collected it for or than the data subject later authorized.

### Access Rights

You may have the right to access the EEA or Swiss Data that we hold about you and to request that we correct, amend, or delete it if it is inaccurate or processed in violation of the Privacy Shield. These access rights may not apply in some cases, including where providing access is unreasonably burdensome or expensive under the circumstances or where it would violate the rights of someone other than the individual requesting access. If you would like to request access to, correction, amendment, or deletion of your EEA or Swiss Data, you can submit a written request to the contact information provided under General Terms above. We may request specific information from you to confirm your identity. In some circumstances we may charge a reasonable fee for access to your information. If your EEA or Swiss Data was provided to us by an Ellucian customer, we may facilitate your access to such data by directing you to the customer that provided your Personal Data to us.

### Security

Ellucian maintains reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect EEA or Swiss Data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction in accordance with the Privacy Shield.

### Data Transfers to Third-Parties

 _Third-Party Agents or Service Providers_. We may transfer EEA or Swiss Data to our third-party agents or service providers that perform functions on our behalf. Where required by the Privacy Shield, we enter into written agreements with those third-party agents and service providers requiring them to provide the same level of protection that the Privacy Shield requires and limiting their use of the data to the specified services provided on our behalf. We take reasonable and appropriate steps (i) to ensure that third-party agents and service providers process EEA or Swiss Data in accordance with our Privacy Shield obligations and (ii) to stop and remediate any unauthorized processing. Under certain circumstances, we may remain liable for the acts of our third-party agents or service providers that perform services on our behalf for their handling of EEA or Swiss Data that we transfer to them.

 _Third-Party Data Controllers_. In some cases, we may transfer EEA or Swiss Data to unaffiliated third-party data controllers. These third-parties do not act as agents or service providers and are not performing functions on our behalf. We may transfer your EEA or Swiss Data to third-party data controllers for the following purposes:

  * Sponsors and exhibitors at certain Ellucian events receive EEA or Swiss Data about attendees, which the sponsors and exhibitors may use for their own promotional purposes.
  * To facilitate provision of services to Ellucian customers, Ellucian may provide EEA or Swiss Data to third-party software and services companies whose products interact with Ellucian products and services in certain instances where an Ellucian customer is also a client of such third-party.



We enter into written contracts with any unaffiliated third-party data controllers requiring them to provide the same level of protection for EEA or Swiss Data that the Privacy Shield requires. We also limit their use of your EEA or Swiss Data so that it is consistent with any consent you have provided and with the notices you have received. If we transfer your EEA or Swiss Data to one of our affiliated entities within our corporate group, we will take steps to ensure that your EEA or Swiss Data is protected with the same level of protection that the Privacy Shield requires.
