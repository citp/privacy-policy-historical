### Collection and Use of Information

Ellucian will only collect your personal information (such as your name, address, or telephone number) if you provide it to us voluntarily. Personal information collected on our Site may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Ellucian and its affiliates and agents maintain facilities. By using our Site, you consent to the storage, processing, and transfer of your personal information outside your country.

In addition, we automatically collect certain information regarding visitors to our Site, including information about your equipment, browsing actions and usage patterns. The information we collect automatically is statistical data and does not include personal information. We use this information solely for internal purposes, such as to improve our Site.

The technologies we use for this automatic data collection include cookies. A cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer. You have the ability to delete cookie files from your hard drive at any time or avoid cookies by configuring your browser to reject them or to notify you when a cookie is being placed on your hard drive.

Ellucian, on its own or through third party vendors, occasionally uses first-party and third party cookies together to inform, optimize and serve ads based on your past visits to our Site.

You can visit this [page](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ "page") and this [page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ "page") to opt out of this advertising.

Our Site uses Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting to help us understand, in aggregate, the age, gender and interests of Site visitors. This Google Analytics tool does not reveal to Ellucian your name or other identifying information. Ellucian does not combine the information collected through use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. The information received from Google Analytics is used only to improve our Site and the type of information displayed to Site visitors so we can better serve those interested in Ellucian. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to our Site by using Google Analytics’ Opt-out Browser Add-on, available on this [page](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).

Our Site may also use Facebook features and tools, including pixel tags added to the Site, that allow data about actions of Site visitors to be sent to Facebook to track conversions and to allow Ellucian to create custom audiences for the products or services Ellucian may advertise on Facebook. We may also provide Facebook with other data we have collected about you for this purpose, using Facebook tools that allow data such as email addresses and phone numbers to be locally hashed on our system before we upload and pass such data to Facebook. Facebook’s use of such data is governed by [Facebook’s Data Use Policy](https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/). You can adjust Facebook ad settings at <https://www.facebook.com/about/ads/>. You can also manage the interest-based advertising you receive or completely opt-out of receiving such advertising by indicating your choice in <http://www.aboutads.info/choices>.

Ellucian occasionally hires other companies to provide services on our behalf; for example, to process event registrations. Ellucian will provide these companies only with the information they need to deliver the services, and they are contractually prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

At any time, while accessing our Site, any visitor may decline participation in any activity that would require providing information (e.g., survey email, or e-commerce). Your decision not to participate will not affect your ability to use any other feature on our Site.

Ellucian offers you opportunities to engage in blogs, forums, and Twitter and Facebook accounts that are designed to be visible to other users, including comments and postings. You should be aware that any personally identifiable information you choose to submit via those media can be read, collected, and used by other participants and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit when you engage in such activities.

Ellucian’s products and services are not intended for children under the age of 13. Ellucian does not knowingly collect any information from children. If we learn that we have collected or received personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information.
