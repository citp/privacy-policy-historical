<p><b><font face="arial, helvetica" size="4" color="#000080">EWI Privacy Policy</font></b></p>

<p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">EWI wants to provide you with a
rewarding, informative and exciting visit to our website and to safeguard your
privacy online.<o:p>
 </o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Here is our policy on privacy issues.
Be sure to check back as these guidelines may change on occasion to reflect new
services.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Spam<o:p>
 </o:p>
</font></b></p>
<p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">EWI does not distribute unsolicited
bulk advertising via email (spam). Also, we do not share email addresses with
outside companies. Any email address provided by the visitor is kept strictly
confidential. We conform to all state and federal laws regarding this issue.</font></p>
<p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><b>Email Communications</b></font></p>
<p><i><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Club EWI:</font></i><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">
Visitors to our site may sign up for Club EWI, a free content service. We
publish new content on a regular basis for all members. The information we
collect from members when they sign up is kept strictly confidential. Members
may opt out of the Club at any time; instructions are clearly communicated in
each email we send.</font></p>
<p><i><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal"><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Former
subscribers:</font></span></i><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">
We occasionally send emails to former subscribers. Most of these emails announce
free content and other resources. Sometimes we send notices that the markets
have reached a critical juncture and invite former subscribers to take another
look at our services. Former subscribers may ask to have their email addresses
removed from our database at any time. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><i><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal"><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Opt-in
Notification Services:</font></span></i><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">
On numerous sections of our website visitors may request that content pieces and
updates be emailed to them. EWI intends that any of the notification programs
(Market Watch, Market Report, Global Wrap, Street Sweep, for example) do not
result in undesired email to subscribers. EWI uses the email addresses solely
for notification, with the exception that we occasionally announce the
availability of other high-value content or special events we feel
notification-content subscribers will be interested in. Subscribers may opt out
of the programs at any time. Instructions for opting out are clearly
communicated on every email message.<o:p>
 </o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><b>Tracking of Personal Information</b></font></p>
<p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">We do not gather information about
individuals reviewing our services without first gaining their permission. Any
data we obtain is used for the purpose of exposing visitors to other relevant
services that we feel could be complementary or an even better fit than the one
currently utilized. We are committed to protecting all of the personal
information that we collect and do not distribute this information to other
companies.</font></p>
<p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><b>Tracking Data</b></font></p>

</ul>
<p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><b>Security</b><o:p>
