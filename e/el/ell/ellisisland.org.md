**General**   
  
The Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation ("SOLEIF") respects your concerns about privacy. SOLEIF's Privacy Policy is intended to provide you with information regarding our use of information collected from users of the AFIHC Experience both on Ellis Island and online at ellisislandrecords.org. As we continue to improve the AFIHC Experience and to utilize new technologies, SOLEIF's Privacy Policy may change over time. We therefore recommend that you review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure that you are familiar with our privacy practices. If at any time you have questions regarding this Privacy Policy, you may always contact a representative of SOLEIF by sending an e-mail to [historycenter@ellisisland.org](mailto:historycenter@ellisisland.org).   
  
**Aggregated Information**   
  
SOLEIF collects anonymous, non-personal, aggregate information, such as AFIHC Experience usage and traffic pattern data, through the collection of zip codes and the use of cookies and IP addresses.   
  
SOLEIF uses cookies to provide tailored information on our website. A cookie is a small data file that a website transfers to online users' hard drives to remember service settings. Cookies do not personally identify SOLEIF users. Cookies allow SOLEIF to measure user activity on the website and to improve users' experiences. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, and to decline to accept it.   
  
SOLEIF also collects IP addresses from every online user. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer and is automatically identified to the SOLEIF web server when you visit the ellisislandrecords.org website. This information is collected to provide aggregate data to our corporate sponsors and advertisers or other third parties about SOLEIF's users.       
  
Such aggregate information collected by SOLEIF may be used either by SOLEIF and its corporate sponsors or shared with unrelated third parties.    
  
**Personal Information**   
  
Personal identifying information may include name, street address, phone number and/or e-mail addresses, and other similar information, some or all of which may be requested of you for access to various information or services at Ellis Island or on the ellisislandrecords.org website (the "Service"). SOLEIF collects personal identifying information from you in circumstances when you knowingly provide such information, including but not limited to when you provide information in connection with your establishing yourself as a SOLEIF Sustaining Member, in posting Annotations or creating your own Family Scrapbook (see Use of Interactive Functions below for more information), or in placing an order with the SOLEIF Store. We will let you know where providing personal information is optional.   
  
SOLEIF uses personal information provided by you in order to improve the AFIHC Experience, to publish information you have submitted to the AFIHC Experience in posting Annotations and in creating and editing Family Scrapbooks (subject to the [Sustaining Member Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/membership/wme_1c.asp)), to help us to service Sustaining Members, to provide you with products or services and to inform you about additional products or services that may be of interest to you.   
  
SOLEIF may share personal information with third parties in the following circumstances: to our corporate sponsors as part of normal business operations; where we believe in good faith that disclosure is required by applicable law; to cooperate with regulators or law enforcement authorities; to protect our rights or property; or to enforce the terms of our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/EIinfo/terms.asp) or the [Sustaining Member Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/membership/wme_1c.asp), which are applicable to Sustaining Members and their Guests.   
  
SOLEIF also may share personal information with unaffiliated third parties that SOLEIF believes offer products or services that would be of interest to you. If you would like to opt-out of such offers for third-party products and services, you may contact SOLEIF at [historycenter@ellisisland.org](mailto:historycenter@ellisisland.org).   
  
SOLEIF understands the importance of providing you with access to any personal information SOLEIF has collected from you. If you would like to review or correct any inaccurate information we have collected, you may contact SOLEIF at [historycenter@ellisisland.org](mailto:historycenter@ellisisland.org).   
  
When you access our site using Netscape's Navigator or Microsoft Internet Explorer, Netscape's Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology is used to protect your communications through data encryption. All personal identifying information collected from you is stored in a secure operating environment. If you are a Sustaining Member and knowingly provide personal identifying information for posting, such as in Annotations or any Family Scrapbooks that are not designated "private," then such information will be made publicly available.   
  
**Use of Interactive Functions**   
  
Sustaining Members and Guests should be aware that any personal information provided in online bulletin boards or other interactive forums, including but not limited to Annotations and Family Scrapbooks designated public (collectively, the "Interactive Forums") will not be kept confidential pursuant to this Privacy Policy. Sustaining Members and Guests are responsible for protecting their own privacy when using the Interactive Functions and are urged to proceed with caution when posting any personally identifying information. See the SOLEIF [Sustaining Member Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/membership/wme_1c.asp) for additional information on the terms of use of the Interactive Forums.   
  
**Links to Non-SOLEIF Sites**   
  
SOLEIF's website contains numerous links to other websites, particularly those of SOLEIF's corporate sponsors and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. SOLEIF takes no responsibility for the privacy practices of such other websites. You should consult the privacy policies of each linked website in order to determine whether the site adheres to a similar privacy policy as SOLEIF.    
  
**Children**   
  
SOLEIF does not collect any information from children that would allow a child to be identified unless the child is accessing the website with his or her parent or guardian's permission using his or her parent or guardian's password.   
  
**Use Signifies Acceptance**   
  
Your use of the AFIHC Experience at Ellis Island and online at www.ellisisland.org signifies that you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
