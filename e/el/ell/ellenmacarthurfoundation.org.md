## Editorial Policy

### Content aims and quality criteria

Our aim is to provide the public with accurate, up to date, and freely accessible information, sourced from reputable experts in the fields of energy and resources, design, engineering, education, economics and any other topic relevant to the debate regarding a regenerative and restorative circular economy. These experts have, at all times, the possibility to update, modify and edit the content they provided to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation Editorial Team.

### Opinions

The views expressed on the site by external contributors do not necessarily reflect those of Ellen MacArthur, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation team, or the Ellen MacArthur Foundation partners and their employees.

### Independence

The information provided by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation Editorial Team has no bias with regard to political opinions, commercial or corporate considerations. Editorial content will never be paid for by advertisers, sponsors or agencies.

### Diversity

Our aim is to ensure a fair balance of opinion, in order to present the site users with an impartial view of issues or topics our editorial content focuses on. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation Editorial Team will not deliberately favour one side over the other, should the issue tackled present polarized views and/or diametrically opposed political stances.

The Ellen MacArthur Foundation Editorial Team complies with international laws regarding intellectual property and copyright protection. Excerpts or passages of previously published material will always involve a clear and comprehensive reference to the author, the title of the original publication, the publisher’s name and/or the url of the original document.

## Funding Policy

The Ellen MacArthur Foundation is a UK-registered charity with a mission to accelerate the transition to a circular economy. It aims to provide a vision and framework for this transition in three key areas:

  * Education - inspiring a generation to re-think, re-design and build a positive future
  * Business - catalysing circular innovation across the economy
  * Insight & Analysis - providing thought leadership and robust evidence about the benefits of the transition



Funding for this activity comes from two key areas:

  * the business with whom it works - The majority of the Foundation’s funding currently comes from its Global Partners and Circular Economy 100 members, who both commit to a three-year programme of circular economy activity. The team works to continue to grow the membership of both groups.
  * research or education-oriented trusts and grants - The Foundation seeks trust and grant funding for its work in insight and education. It has received funding from the EU, as well as from private organisations, such as the MAVA Foundation, to deliver specific pieces of research on key topics. This research is key to the Foundation’s ability to validate the benefits of the circular economy and such funding continues to be sought.



Details of the Foundation’s funding status can be found in its Annual Report and Accounts available from Companies House and the Charities Commission in the UK.
