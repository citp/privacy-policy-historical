We occasionally send emails to former subscribers. Most of these emails announce free content and other resources. Sometimes we send notices that the markets have reached a critical juncture and invite former subscribers to take another look at our services. Former subscribers may ask to have their email addresses removed from our database at any time.  
  
  
**Tracking of Personal Information**

We do not gather information about individuals reviewing our services without first gaining their permission. Any data we obtain is used for the purpose of exposing visitors to other relevant services that we feel could be complementary or an even better fit than the one currently utilized. We are committed to protecting all of the personal information that we collect and do not distribute this information to third parties without your consent.

In addition to the services mentioned above, there are numerous sections of our website where visitors may request that content pieces and updates be emailed to them. EWI intends that any of the notification programs (Market Watch, Market Report, Currencies Outlook, Free Trial, etc.) do not result in undesired email to subscribers. EWI uses the email addresses solely for notification, with the exception that we occasionally announce the availability of other high-value content or special events we feel notification-content subscribers will be interested in. Subscribers may opt out of the programs at any time. Instructions for opting out are clearly communicated on every email message.   


**Tracking Data**

As is standard with most websites, when you visit or interact with www.elliottwave.com or www.elliotwave.net, our servers will automatically note and record the following information: 

  * IP - Internet Protocol Address 
  * ISP - Internet Service Provider 
  * Browser type and version 
  * Operating system 
  * Logins to password-protected areas   




**Security**

We use a secure server and take precautions to secure the information provided to us. However, we cannot guarantee the security of any information as it is transferred over the Internet, so please understand that you do so at your own risk.
