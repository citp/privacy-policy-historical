This privacy statement covers the websites of ElliottWave.com, Deflation.com and eWaves.com and is effective as of 7/24/2015. 

**_DATA COLLECTION POLICY_**

_**Collection of Information**_

**Aggregate Data:** You may visit web pages within the Elliott Wave Network of websites referenced above without giving us any personally identifiable information (PII) about yourself. We do collect aggregate (non-PII) data such as browser type, connection speed, previously viewed products on our site, click paths, etc. about users using cookies (See the "Tracking Cookies" section below). Any data we obtain automatically using these tracking technologies is used to enhance the website experience such as exposing visitors to other relevant services that we feel could be complementary. We also use this data for analytic trend studies. You will be notified when your personally identifiable information is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party. We do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable information.

**Personally Identifiable Information:** In order to deliver services you've requested and personalize your experience with the Elliott Wave Network of websites referenced above further, we may ask for you to give personally identifiable information (PII ) such as your name, postal address, email address, phone number, interests or preferences, IP address, credit card number, etc. We are committed to protecting all of the personally identifiable information that we collect and thus this information is kept strictly confidential and is not distributed to third parties who are not service providers or as described in this privacy statement without your consent.

We store the information that we collect through cookies and clear gif images to create a "profile" of your preferences. We then tie your personally identifiable information (such as your name, email address, and interests or preferences), and your purchasing history, to information in your customer profile, in order to provide tailored promotions and marketing offers and to enhance your website experience. 

We may request personally identifiable information when you:

  * Sign up for one of our free content programs such as Club EWI, Free Email Newsletters, or our Affiliate Program
  * Purchase something through our online store or friendly customer service representatives
  * Participate in a survey, whether through an email or on any of the Elliott Wave Network of websites referenced above 
  * Access password-protected resources hosted on any of the Elliott Wave Network of websites referenced above
  * Open an email or click a link within our email communications



**Testimonials:** Likewise, if you choose to submit a testimonial on the Elliott Wave Network of websites referenced above (Members and Affiliates areas), we will ask for your permission to share it with our other customers. You also have the option to post anonymous testimonials. You may also request that a testimonial be removed from the Elliott Wave Network of websites referenced above by contacting EWI Customer Care.

**_Our Promise to You_**

We value you as a customer of EWI and likewise we value your privacy. The information we collect is kept strictly confidential and will not be given, sold, or shared with outside companies who are not service providers or as described in this privacy statement. 

EWI does not distribute unsolicited bulk advertising via email (spam). You may opt-out of any of our various email lists, such as our Free Email Newsletters, Club EWI, Subscriber Updates, etc. by simply following the instructions included in each email communication, by visiting the My Account section of ElliottWave.com, or by contacting EWI Customer Care. 

In order to comply with the Federal CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, we may provide a list of email addresses of customers who have opted-out of EWI's email lists to other companies that send email on our behalf (Email Service Providers). This suppression list is used solely for the purpose of preventing an unsubscribed EWI customer from receiving EWI-related emails from another company. We require all companies that send to their email lists on our behalf to sign an agreement prohibiting the suppression list from being used for any other purpose than not sending you our email. We conform to all state and federal laws regarding this issue. 

_**Use of Collected Information**_

Any of the information we collect from you whether PII or aggregate may be used in any or all of the following ways:
