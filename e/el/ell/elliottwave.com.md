**Anti-Spam Policies **

EWI does not distribute unsolicited bulk advertising via email (spam). You may opt-out of any of our various email lists, such as our Free Newsletters, Club EWI, and Subscriber Updates by simply following the instructions included in each email communication or by visiting the Edit Profile option on our web site. 

We do not share email addresses with outside companies who are not service providers or as described in this privacy statement, unless we request your permission, first. We will always give you the option not to receive our promotional emails or newsletters or to “opt-out” by following the unsubscribe instructions in each email or newsletter or by visiting the Edit Profile option on our site. We conform to all state and federal laws regarding this issue.

In order to comply with the Federal CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, we may provide a list of email addresses of customers who have opted-out of email lists here at Elliott Wave International to other companies that send email on our behalf (Email Service Providers). This suppression list is used solely for the purpose of preventing an unsubscribed EWI customer from receiving EWI-related emails from another company. We require all companies that send to their email lists on our behalf to sign an agreement prohibiting the suppression list from being used for any other purpose than not sending you our email.
