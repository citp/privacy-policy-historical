Ellad2.com respects your privacy. In general, you can visit Ellad2.com without telling me who you are or revealing any information about yourself.  You can register yourself on Ellad2.com but it is not necessary.

I want that my customers don’t have to give a lot of information before they are able to buy something. There are times, however, when I may need information from you, such as your e-mail address. It is my intent to let you know before I collect personal information from you.

If you choose to give me personal information that I may need to correspond with you or to send you a Tutorial, it is my intent to let you know how I will use this information. If you tell me that you do not wish to have this information used as a basis for further contact with you, we will respect your wishes.
