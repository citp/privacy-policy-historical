# Privacy policy - Beading Tutorials and Patterns by Ellad2

**Privacy policy:**

Our website address is: https://ellad2.com.

Ellad2.com respects your privacy!   
In general you can visit Ellad2.com without telling who you are. If you want, you can register on Ellad2.com and create an account, but it is not an obligation.  
To create an account we need a name and email address. We don’t store payment information

We do not want to force our customers first to provide all kind information, before they can make a purchase. You do not need this in a “normal store” either. Our intention is to store as little personal information as possible. There are times, however, that we need information from you, such as your e-mail address.

We use your e-mail address to correspond with you.  
For example: To confirm your order, to communicate the order status and to be able to send the purchase to you. If you do not wish this information to be used as a basis for further contact, we will respect this.

Information collected by Ellad2.com is only used internally for three reasons:

  1. We collect information to determine how we can improve our website. We use Google Analytics for this. This piece of online tools shows us which parts of the website are the most popular, from which country our visitors are coming and in which language they use the website.
  2. We also use the information we collect to tailor the website to your personal interests. For example: An overview of previous purchases, wish list, order status and downloads.
  3.  Finally, we also keep track of how you found our website. Did you see an advertisement, a message on Facebook or did you use a search engine such as Google or Bing. We analyze this data for statistics and to see what works or does not work. The data is then deleted.
