**Types of Information We Collect**

Unless you voluntarily provide personal information to us (such as your name, address, age, telephone number, or e-mail address), the Company will not collect it. If you have enabled our mobile application to locate you, the Company may gather your location information as well. If you do not want your personal information collected, please do not submit it to us. If you have already submitted this information and would like us to remove it from our records, please contact us at info@elwoodclothing.com.

When you do provide us with personal information, we may use that information to improve the content of the Site, to notify you about updates to the Site, and to contact you directly regarding products or promotions we believe may be of interest to you. We may also use it to analyze your shopping history, your use of the Company’s mobile applications and the Site, and demographic information (gender, age and location, for example) about the Company’s online customers.

If you apply for a job with the Company, we may collect information from your resume and other employment-related submissions.

In addition to information that we collect from you directly, the Company may gather information associated with your social media account if that information is available to the Company. This includes your profile information, email address, name and posted photographs. If the Site offers an “email-a-friend” or similar link, and you email a friend using that link, we will collect the name and email address of that friend as well.

Except as described below in this section and under the “Disclosure of Information” section, we do not give or sell any user information to any third party. However, the Company may disclose your personal information when required by law or court order.
