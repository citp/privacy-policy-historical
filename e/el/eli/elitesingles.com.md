AFFINITAS GROUP is a service on the internet that brings people together who are looking for a long-lasting relationship. To provide this service, we collect, process and use a range of personal information. In many cases, personal information is only used in pseudonym form or anonymously. A more detailed description on this topic can be found below.

This information is used by us for statistical purposes without reference to individuals.

**(b) With Registration**

If you want to use the services of AFFINITAS GROUP described in detail in the AFFINITAS GROUP [Terms & Conditions](https://web.archive.org/terms), we need some personal information from you in order to provide the desired service.

We only use the personal information that you actively provide us (e.g. contact information for the registration, profile information or photos). In many cases, you can decide what personal information you reveal about yourself in the context of profiling and / or search. Personal information that is strictly necessary for the provision of the contract is always marked separately as required (e.g. email address) so that you know what information you need to enter for the use of the service and what you can do without.

For more detailed information please see below. To learn more about the details of each product of the AFFINITAS GROUP, please note our detailed information in the AFFINITAS GROUP [Help](https://support.elitesingles.com/hc/en-us?utm_source=website&utm_medium=dru&utm_campaign=contactform)[ page](https://support.elitesingles.com/hc/en-us/articles/203032922) of each AFFINITAS GROUP product.

(aa) With the free registration you will be prompted to provide the following details without which, registration cannot be completed:

  * Height
  * Marital Status
  * Education
  * Occupation
  * Income



During the personality test you will be asked to answer a series of personal questions (e.g. partner preferences, personal characteristics and desired traits in a partner). Information such as ethnicity or religion is considered sensitive personal data, which is subject to increased legal protection and protected by us with increased technological care. We collect this data and other profile information (e.g. interests and preferences), because they are the basis of our matching service and the basis of your AFFINITAS GROUP profile. Direct contact information (e.g. e-mail address, postal code) does not appear on the profile and is therefore not visible to other members.

  * First and Last Name
  * Bank account details or credit card information, which are collected by our trusted third party services provider

During every visit to the AFFINITAS GROUP service, utilization information is forwarded by your Internet browser and stored in log files called Server Log Files. Without limitation, this information consists of:

  * IP address (Internet Protocol address) of the accessing computer
  * User ID on the AFFINITAS GROUP platforms
  * Name of the page
  * Date and time of access
  * The referrer URL from which you came to the requested page
  * Amount of personal information transferred
  * Status indication whether download was successful
  * Session Cookies
  * Session identification number



This information will be evaluated anonymously by us for statistical purposes.

(dd) The use of personal information for the provision of the AFFINITAS GROUP service:

The collection of personal information at AFFINITAS GROUP is done principally with the aim of giving the customer a safe, smooth, efficient, and personal use of the AFFINITAS GROUP service. The personal information is used to provide the services requested and desired by the customer. However, the collection of this information also aids in detecting and investigating potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and is used for the enforcement of the Terms and Conditions and the contract.

**In the following, the use of personal information is described in more detail:**

  * Other members can see your profile information and entries on the AFFINITAS GROUP page. Premium members can also see the photos you upload on AFFINITAS GROUP.
  * Your profile - and thus your profile information and uploaded photos - is suggested to other members as part of our matching method. The matching can be switched off in your account. When switched off, your profile will not be suggested to any other members and at the same time you do not get any partner suggestions. Note that if you deactivate matching, other members will not be able to see your profile.
  * Other members can see when you visit their profile page. Conversely, you can also see which members have visited your profile. This is an essential element of the contact between members. In general it is an important part of the services of social networking sites, and thus the service of AFFINITAS GROUP. Therefore, this cannot be turned off via the user account.
  * Other members can send you messages using the AFFINITAS GROUP platforms. However, at no point does AFFINITAS GROUP give out your e-mail address. Messages are only sent through your AFFINITAS GROUP mailbox. You can always "block" undesirables if you want to make it so they can no longer contact you.



Email notifications: With your consent, AFFINITAS GROUP may send various notifications to every registered user:

  * In the context of customer relationship and customer service messages we will inform you if, for example, other members have visited your profile, you have been sent a message, been smiled at or if there are new members that fit your search criteria. You can always disable these service messages on your user account under message options.
  * We may also send you AFFINITAS GROUP information and special offers, such as tips and useful information about the partner search, surveys and special offers for your AFFINITAS GROUP membership. You can disable the AFFINITAS GROUP info and special offers messages with your user account under message options.
  * Information messages pertaining to the service, such as the confirmation of customer service and information on the release of images and texts, and on the conclusion of a paid membership, in the form of contract documents, payment processing information.
  * We would also like to inform you via e-mail about AFFINITAS GROUP Partner offers and events. To protect you and AFFINITAS GROUP from abuse, we introduce in this newsletter, the so-called "double opt-in" procedure, i.e. you only receive the newsletter, if you have ordered it by e-mail or in your user account and confirmed your email address. You can unsubscribe at any time by deactivating this either in the message options, or by following the unsubscribe process in the newsletter.
  * If you change your message options, it can take up to 48 hours before it is active. Nevertheless, depending on the message options, the cancellation is still successful, and after this period you will receive no additional messages from us.
  * We hereby notify you that we carry out statistical analysis on opening and viewing behavior of our emails. This is done with the help of small graphics that are embedded in the messages (called pixels). If you do not wish to have your viewing behavior analyzed, you can disable graphics by default in your email client. For more information, please see instructions offered in your email client, i.e. Microsoft Outlook or Mozilla Thunderbird. Once images are deactived, the messages are not displayed in full, and message functionality may be limited.



AFFINITAS GROUP sets a filter to protect users from unsolicited mail. For example, automatic filters prevent the sending of messages with certain pay numbers or certain inappropriate keywords

"Like" feature: Under the photos and entries of other profiles there is a “Like" button that can be clicked. With the "Like" function, you can express that you like statements or pictures in the profile of another member with one click. As a consequence, the other member is notified. In your own profile you can see how many members like a particular text field or photo of you. You can also see which members have clicked "Like" on a certain profile element.

“Message Read”: Premium members can use this function to detect whether their messages have been clicked on by the recipient. When a message is clicked by the recipient, the sender gets a message about the time it was accessed.

Import photos from Facebook: If you have a user profile on Facebook, you can transfer photos from this profile to your AFFINITAS GROUP profile. To do this you must click on the appropriately labeled button to connect to Facebook and log in there with your Facebook user personal information. After successful login a window will appear where all your Facebook user account pictures are stored. You can select up to 24 photos and import them into your AFFINITAS GROUP profile.

Personality Profile: In order to find suitable partners among other EliteSingles members, an individual personality profile is created for each EliteSingles member using the answers given in the EliteSingles personality test. You can find this personality profile in your profile as a separate menu item. It can be seen both by yourself, as well as by other members. It covers five major dimensions of your personality and, in addition, three related sub-dimensions ("facets"). Basic and Premium Members only see the results of the main dimensions.

For additional information about the expiration of the service in general, and answers to other questions about AFFINITAS GROUP, see our detailed descriptions on the AFFINITAS GROUP Help page.

**(c) Personal information Transfer to Third Parties**

When we transmit personal information in the framework of the provision of the service to other members, this is only in connection with the user name you choose. Under no circumstances do we share with other members direct contact information (such as your name, your address, or your e-mail address). Communication at AFFINITAS GROUP is exclusively done via your internal mailbox so that you can decide for yourself to whom you disclose your contact details. Some personal information that you specified when creating your AFFINITAS GROUP profile are always visible to other registered users. This personal information includes age, gender, height, ethnicity, religion, occupation, smoking habits and children. Please note that if you choose to include personal information in a public area of your profile, you consent to the public disclosure of the personal information you choose to place in the public portion of your profile. If you do not wish to publish your personal information in this manner, please do not include it in the public portion of your profile.

You can decide on the settings on your account, whether you want to continue to have your profile suggested to other members through our matching process.

Personal information will only be passed on to third parties if necessary to provide the service offered (e.g. payment processing for fee-based memberships), or if you have given us your consent or disclosure is required in accordance with relevant statutory provisions that are required or permitted (e.g. if we have to comply with a request, a governmental investigative or security agency).

In addition to internal AFFINITAS GROUP checks, outsourced partners including Apollo Solutions Ltd., Informatics Park, La Tour Koenig, Pointe aux Sables and Mauritius ("Apollo Solutions") also check uploaded photos of AFFINITAS GROUP members for authenticity to ensure a high quality of service and to protect our members from scammers.

We reserve the right to transfer any personal information we have about you in the event that we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets to a third party. Further, we reserve the right to disclose any personal information as needed if such information is requested by law enforcement agencies or if we are requested to do so by law, regulation, court order, or by a government entity. We may also disclose your personal information to third parties if we have reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to: (i) conduct investigations of possible breaches of law; (ii) cooperate in any legal investigation; (iii) identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating the Terms of Use of this websites; or (iv) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property.

These plugins are identified by a Facebook logo. If you use a social plugin on an AFFINITAS GROUP site, your browser establishes a direct connection with the Facebook servers. Facebook then transmits the plugin content to your browser, and then integrates it into the websites .

Thereby Facebook obtains the information that you have accessed on the corresponding AFFINITAS GROUP page.
