(g)         Automated Processing . Viral Launch may use some automated processing to provide our Services and to make recommendations in the context of specific Services. This processing is strictly necessary for providing certain Services (and, in some cases, is the service itself) and is not covered by consent. Other automated processing is not significant either due to the nature of the data or the decisions being made or recommended, and so consent is not required. However, for automated processing that is significant and related to sensitive Personal Data, prior to sharing or using such data, Viral Launch will first seek your consent. For the subset of automated processing included in ad profiling for ad targeting, you can change your consent status (for Website Services) by disabling advertising cookies. 

(h)         To Enable Social Sharing and Connect with Us on Social Media . Some of the Services consist of social sharing and communication with others. If you sign up for such Services, Viral Launch may ask for your consent to use your information to enable sharing as described in the Service.

Internet-Based Advertising

Interest-based advertising is advertising that is targeted to you based on your web browsing and Internet usage over time and across our website. Viral Launch’s advertising practices also include the creation and use of “audience segments”. You have the option to restrict the use of information for interest-based advertising and to opt-out of receiving interest-based ads. You may also be asked to consent to our use of cookies, including advertising cookies. Additional information choices for interest-based advertising is found below. For all of the interest-based advertising described, you have the choice to not have your data used to target and serve you interest-based advertising—including third party advertising—regardless of where such ads might be served. These opt-outs require that strictly necessary cookies are not blocked by the settings in your web browser. If you live in the United States, Canada, or the European Union, you can visit Ad Choices (US), Your Ad Choices (Canada), or Your Online Choices (EU) for more information regarding opting-out of interest-based advertising with participating entities for each region. The website also provides detailed information about how interest-based advertising works. Opting-out does not mean that you will no longer receive advertising from us, or when you use the Internet; rather, it means that the data collected from the Website will not be used for interest-based advertising and that the advertising you see displayed on the website will not be customized to your interests.

Managing Preferences and Withdrawing Consent

You may, at any time, withdraw your consent with future effect and without affecting the lawfulness of processing of your Personal Data based on the consent you provided before you withdrew it, and exercise other controls regarding Website and online data collection, interest-based advertising, your communication settings, and device preferences. Depending on the Services, collection and use of Personal Data may be required for the Services to work. Viral Launch provides you with several ways to manage your preferences:

(a)         Cookie Use and Controls . Cookies are pieces of data stored in your web browser that are transmitted to websites to remember your browser over time and distinguish it from other users. Cookies are used to remember you and personalize your web experience and for security, analytics, marketing, and interest-based advertising. Viral Launch’s cookies are placed and read by our web servers, while other cookies are placed and read by other companies’ web servers. You can block and control cookies using the information noted in this section. If you block all cookies, certain functionality on our website and Services will not work.

(b)         IP Address Use . An IP address is an identifier assigned by a network to a computer, mobile device, or routing device. Viral Launch’s advertising and analytics partners may use IP addresses to group or correlate devices for purposes of analytics, security and anti-fraud purposes, interest-based advertising, ad targeting, ad attribution, and limiting ad frequency. 

        (c)         Web Pixels or Beacons . Pixels are extremely small image files that, when loaded by your web browser, cause the browser to make a network request to the party corresponding to the pixel. If that party’s cookies are currently stored in your browser, those cookies will be transmitted with the request. Beacons can be used on web pages for advertising or to confirm the opening of a marketing email. When used in conjunction with cookies for interest-based-advertising, the cookie controls above can be used to control the purpose for which they are used.

        (d)         HTML5 Local Storage . HTML5 local storage in the browser is different from cookies, but can be used for the same purpose (i.e., to pair a tracking ID to a particular web server with your web browser so that the web server can identify your web browser over time). You can control the purpose for which HTML5 local storage is used by using the cookie controls outlined above and in our browser settings.

        (e)         Flash Cookie Use . Flash cookies are “local shared objects” used by Flash player to store data, similar to cookies. If you have Flash installed, and wish to delete, block, or manage Flash cookies, please use the Flash settings panel made available by Adobe.

        (f)         Social Networks . Social network widgets, buttons, and plug-ins on our website passively transmit data regarding a social network’s members to that social network, even when a button is not clicked. These technologies may allow a social network (e.g., Facebook, Twitter or YouTube) to personally identify its members and to know the web pages its members have visited. This is the case where social network buttons are embedded, regardless of whether a button is “clicked”, “pressed” or “selected”. If you belong to a social network or use these categories of web services, you should review the privacy policies of those services to understand the nature of the data that they collect and what, if any, options the service offers to control how data is collected and used. If you disable advertising cookies, the passive tracking associated with these buttons will be blocked on our sites.

        (g)         Mobile Device Advertising ID’s, Location and other Data Use . Viral Launch’s Services may transmit Device ID’s, Location Data, and data from sensors to us and our partners, including our advertising partners. Device IDs include IDs associated with your mobile device carrier, platform-specific IDs such as Android ID, Google AID, and Apple's IDFA, and IDs that are part of your device hardware, such as WiFi address and serial number. Exactly which Device IDs are transmitted can depend on your mobile device platform and the version of your operating system. Viral Launch’s Services may also collect Device IDs and network addresses (including IP addresses, MAC addresses, and SSIDs) from other, in-range or networked devices and WiFi access points. Viral Launch may use Device IDs, coarse location and Location Data, and data from sensors, including the local network, for strictly necessary purposes; improving our Services and analytics; personalization and preferences; and cross-app, cross-device, interest-based advertising.

        (h)         Withdrawing Consent for Use of Mobile Device ID’s, and for Analytics and Advertising . Activating the “Limit Ad Tracking”, “Opt out of Ads Personalization”, or equivalent setting from your mobile device will transmit a signal to Viral Launch and any third parties that we use and when that signal is received by Viral Launch or third parties, it communicates your choice to not have Device IDs used for purposes of advertising or analytics. Viral Launch honors the signal and requires that our third party advertising and analytics partners do the same.

        (i)         Consent Settings for Communication . After signing up for email communications, you can choose to unsubscribe using the unsubscribe link in any commercial email we send. If you use more than one of Viral Launch’s Services, then unsubscribing from the emails relating to that Service may not stop you from receiving emails from other Services. Please note that if you unsubscribe from all emails, then this means that you have unsubscribed from all emails other than strictly necessary emails. You will still receive email communications from us if they are strictly necessary to provide the Services or to confirm or validate a transaction, recover accounts, etc.

The Personal Data that Viral Launch processes, and all associated Services and systems, including registration, is housed on servers in the United States.
