						      PRIVACY POLICY<br>
						      Effective Date:  August 2, 2010<br>
						      Last Updated: December 27, 2010</strong></p>
						    <p> <strong>Our Commitment To Privacy and Restrictions on Use of Our  Site</strong><br>
						      EliteMysteryShopper.com ("Site") is an Internet property of WebWorks, a  division of Site Central, LLC ("we," "us"). Your privacy is  important to us. In this statement we explain our online information practices  and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and  used. We will use reasonable efforts to make this statement available via a  link on our homepage and elsewhere on our site for easy reference. </p>
						    <p> Our Site may not be used by persons under eighteen (18) years  of age, or persons who are not residents of the United States. Persons in these  categories must not disclose any information to us, or use this Site. We do not  knowingly request, solicit or collect information from persons under eighteen  (18) years of age, or from anyone who is not a United States resident. We  define "United States" as the fifty (50) states, plus U.S.  territories, including the Midway Islands, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Virgin  Islands, Micronesia, Marshall Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, Palau and  Guam. </p>
						    <p> We contract with data providers and payment processors  (collectively "Service Providers") to deliver the data in our Members’ Area,  and process payments from Members. If you make a purchase, you will be  providing your information to our Service Providers. We may also obtain certain  information from you, and we may contact you directly without using our Service  Providers. Any information you provide may be shared between us and our Service  Providers.&nbsp; We are not responsible for our Service  Providers' privacy policies and recommend you read their privacy policies  carefully.&nbsp; If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy or our Service Providers' privacy policies, <a href="contact.php">contact us</a> for assistance.</p>
						    <p>We may use your email address to notify you of program  updates, and we may send you certain transactional messages relating to the  EliteMysteryShopper.com service, such as service announcements, administrative  messages, and similar messages that are considered part of your EliteMysteryShopper.com  account.&nbsp;&nbsp; We may sell or transfer this  information if we sell our business or its assets.</p>
						    <p> <strong>How We Collect and Use Information:&nbsp; Cookies, Clear gifs, and Other Means</strong><br>
						      Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive which help us  recognize you as a user or Member and assist you in navigating the Site as  easily as possible.&nbsp; We use cookies to  recognize users and collect information about how our Site is used. Information  gathered from cookies may include the date and time of visits, the Site pages  viewed, time spent at our Site and the websites that you visited just before  and just after your visit to our Site. If you do not wish to transmit  "cookie" information about yourself, you may turn off the cookie  function in your web browser. Please consult the "Help" section of  your web browser in order to correctly turn off or disable the cookie  functions. However, turning off or disabling the cookie functions on your web  browser may prevent our system from recognizing you when you visit our Site,  and consequently may make utilization of the Site more difficult, or even  impossible.</p>
						    <p> We may also use "clear gifs" (which also have other  names, such as "pixel tags") and/or JavaScript plug-ins, on our  website and in our emails to you. These are small graphic images or code which  are used for such things as recording web pages and links clicked-on by a user,  or for tracking the performance of email marketing campaigns. These devices  help us measure the effectiveness of our Site and our marketing. We may work  with third-party service providers that help us track, collect, and analyze  this information.&nbsp; Third-party entities  with whom we have agreements may also place these devices on the Site and/or in  emails to use information obtained from them such as pages viewed, items  purchased, emails opened and items upon which you may click in emails.</p>
						    <p> A "widget" is generally an application that can be embedded  in a web page.&nbsp; Widgets can provide  real-time information to the page.&nbsp;  Widgets are often provided by third-parties and we may provide widgets  on our Site.&nbsp; Widgets may enable the  third-parties that provide them to collect data about users visiting this  Site.&nbsp; Also by clicking on certain  widgets, some of your information may be shared with the third-party placing  the widget.&nbsp; We may also obtain  information shared with us through the providers of these widgets.&nbsp; </p>
						    <p> Our Site's servers also automatically identify your computer  by its IP address, which is a unique string of numbers that is assigned to your  computer by your Internet service provider. IP addresses are automatically  logged by web servers, collecting information about a user's traffic patterns.  While the IP address does not identify an individual by name, it may, with the  cooperation of the ISP, be used to locate and identify an individual using the  Internet. Your IP address can also reveal what geographic area you are  connecting from, or which ISP you are using. Your IP address may be used to  address problems with our server, administer our Site and/or to gather broad  demographic information about our users and Members. Finally, the other  websites that you visit have IP addresses, and we may collect the IP addresses  of those websites and their pages.</p>
						    <p> We reserve the right to employ user and Member source  information, including applicable category and interest(s), for marketing  purposes. This source information may be shared with our third party marketing  partners. We also reserve the right to retain cookie, pixel tag and widget data  indefinitely.&nbsp; We may sell or transfer  this information if we sell or transfer our business.</p>
						    <p>Finally, we will comply with legal, judicial or  administrative authorities in the event that information must be reviewed or  released in response to civil and/or criminal investigations, claims, lawsuits,  or if we are subject to judicial or administrative process (such as a subpoena)  to release your information or to prosecute or defend legal actions.&nbsp; </p>
						    <p> <strong>Your California  Privacy Rights</strong><br>
						      We collect various types of personal information about you  during the course of your relationship with us as a user or Member. Under  California law, if you are a resident of California, you may make a written  request to us about how we have shared your information with third parties for  their direct marketing purposes. To exercise your rights under California law,  please send your written request to the email address or postal address given  below. Please include your postal address in your request.</p>
						    <p> <strong>Visitors to the  Website Outside of the United States</strong><br>
						      If you are visiting the Site from a location outside of the  U.S., your connection will be through and to servers located in the U.S.&nbsp; The data protection laws in the U.S. might  not be as those in your country.&nbsp; By  using this Site and/or submitting information to us, you specifically consent  to the transfer of your information to the U.S. and to the facilities and  servers we use, within or outside the U.S., and to those with whom we may share  your information.</p>
						    <p> <strong>Unsubscribe/Opt-Out</strong><br>
						      To unsubscribe or opt-out of receiving future commercial communications from  us, or from our affiliates, please <a href="http://webworks.webwks.com/5509e0ed3bd1fa999ba41ed3564adc64" target="_blank">Click Here</a> and enter your email address in our unsubscribe system.
