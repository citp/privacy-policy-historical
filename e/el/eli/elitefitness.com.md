Don't forget, EliteFitness.com has been online since 1996. That makes us older than Google! So remember, when you place an order at Elite Fitness, your VISA, Mastercard, AMEX, or Discover card number is encrypted, or scrambled, so completely, that it is unreadable during transit. You'll see a discreet charge from Elite Fitness on your billing statement. And you're 100% protected by our [Safe Shopping Guarantee](https://web.archive.org/images/ordersystem/safeshop.html). |
