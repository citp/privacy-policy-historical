**_Security_**

We understand and share your concern about security and privacy. It is reassuring to know that it is statistically safer to use your credit card on the web than to use it in a store or restaurant. The information that you provide when placing an order with us (e.g. your name, address, and credit card information) is secure. It cannot be read or tampered with during transmission.

EliteDeals.com is hosted by Yahoo! Store on its secure servers and our orders are processed using their shopping cart. Our checkout process uses industry standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technology to encrypt and scramble all personal information including your name, address, and credit card information so that it may not be read by others as it travels over the Internet. Secure Socket Layer encryption is employed during checkout when the URL in browsers, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator, changes from "http" to "https". The "s" indicates that you are in a secure area. Your browser may also show a pop-up window when you are here.

For your security, we authorize your credit card after we obtain confirmation that your card is a valid number and has not been reported lost or stolen. We also verify that the "Bill To" address matches the address on the credit card used. It is not uncommon for a request for credit card authorization to fail at times. We will contact you if we experience such difficulties and you may wish to provide another credit card.

Email is not encrypted so please do not transmit your credit card number via e-mail.

Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, the maximum amount that your bank can require you pay for any fraudulent charge on your credit card is up to $50. Notify your credit card company immediately should you ever suspect a fraudulent charge on your credit card as you would for any other unauthorized charge.
