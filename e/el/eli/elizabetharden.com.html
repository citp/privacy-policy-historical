<p class="header">PRIVACY POLICY</p>

<p>Elizabeth Arden, Inc. ("we" or "Elizabeth Arden") has created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy.  This policy sets forth our information collection and use practices only for the website located at shop.elizabetharden.com (the "Site") and does not apply to any other Elizabeth Arden website or service.  If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, you may not access or otherwise use this Site.  These policies apply to all visits to this Site.</p>

<p>We also direct you to our Terms of Conditions and Use statement, which governs your use of the Site.</p>

<p><b><u>INFORMATION ELIZABETH ARDEN COLLECTS</u></b></p>

<p><b>1. Personally Identifiable Information.</b></p>

<p>When using the Site, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information ("PII"), which is information that could reasonably be used to identify you personally.  For example, we may seek PII when you choose to open an account with us, purchase a product, participate in a game, electronic bulletin board, contest, sweepstakes, or other promotional event.  PII can include your name, billing address, shipping address, e-mail address, telephone number or mobile telephone number, date of birth, credit card information or information about other Elizabeth Arden products you have purchased.  This helps us to determine how best to provide useful information to customers and to determine which of our products or services are of the most interest to them.  We may also ask you to create a screen name and/or a password, where applicable, and provide us with demographic information (such as information about your age or gender), information regarding your interests, or similar information.</p>

<p>PII will only be collected when it is voluntarily provided to Elizabeth Arden.  You can always choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of or participate in certain features of the Site.</p>

<p><b>2. Non-personally Identifiable Information.</b></p>

<p>As is true with most websites, we may also collect from you non-personally identifiable information, such as an IP host address, the pages viewed, the browser type, the Site usage, and other data which do not identify any individual ("Aggregate Information").  When your computer contacts our web servers (for example, when you visit the Site, view an HTML e-mail, or download an interactive desktop from the Site), Aggregate Information may be collected automatically.  We also may determine the applicable technology available to serve you the most appropriate version of a web page, e-mail or similar service.</p>

<p>We use a third-party service provider to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on this site. They may collect anonymous information about your visits to our website and your interaction with our products and services. They may also use information about your visits to this and other websites associated with the network advertiser to target advertisements for goods and services. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag, which is industry standard technology used by most major websites. No personally identifiable information is collected or used in this process. They do not know the name, phone number, address, email address, or any personally identifying information about the user. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this anonymous information used by our third party service provider, please <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>

<p><b>3. Cookies and Tracking Technology</b></p>

<p>The Site may use browser "cookies."  Cookies are pieces of information that may be placed on your computer by a website for the purpose of facilitating and enhancing your communication and interaction with a particular website.  We may use cookies to customize your visit to the Site and for other purposes to make your visit more convenient or to enable us to enhance our service.  For example, we may use cookies when we conduct polls or contests to limit multiple responses and registrations, or we may use cookies to track usage patterns on the Site or to analyze web activity.  You may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or remove them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences.  If you do so, you may still use the Site, but it may interfere with some of its functionality.  We do not use cookies to automatically retrieve PII from your computer without your knowledge.</p>

<p>In addition to cookies, the Site uses a variety of technical methods for tracking purposes, including web beacons.  Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of websites.  Elizabeth Arden also uses these technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on the www.shop.elizabetharden.com website, such as the frequency with which our users visit various parts of the Site.</p>

<p><b><u>HOW ELIZABETH ARDEN USES THE INFORMATION IT COLLECTS</u></b></p>

<p><b>1. Personally Identifiable Information.</b></p>

<p>PII submitted to us is used to deliver the products or services you request, to keep you informed about changes affecting our services or your account, to inform you of products, including product launches, games or offers services from Elizabeth Arden (such as through personalized messages) and its affiliated companies in which you might be interested, and to improve and enhance the Site and services.  There are also times when we may make certain PII available to companies that have a strategic relationship with or perform services to you on our behalf.  For instance, such companies may help us process information, extend credit, fulfill customer orders, deliver products to you, manage our data or provide customer service.  Without making the information available to these third party companies, it would be very difficult for you to purchase products, receive customer service or provide us feedback on the content of this Site.  If you provide PII to Elizabeth Arden, our partners and we will take all reasonable and appropriate steps to protect it from unauthorized disclosure.</p>

<p>In addition to the uses of PII explained above, by giving Elizabeth Arden your telephone and/or mobile telephone number, you expressly authorize Elizabeth Arden to contact you by telephone and send you text messages.  If the number you provide is for a mobile telephone, please be aware that your wireless carrier may charge you for the receipt of such messages, and other charges may apply.  If you do not want to receive such messages, you should not provide us with your telephone or mobile telephone number.  You may opt-out of receiving such messages by following the opt-out procedures below.</p>

<p>We may conduct joint promotions with other companies.  We may share with our promotional partners (and their service providers) certain PII as necessary to conduct the promotion.  We will not share this information with our promotional partners for any other purpose unless you provide us with your consent to do so.  We do not sell or rent your PII to other marketers.</p>

<p>We may combine the information we collect about you at the Site with information available to us from other sources.  For example, you may provide PII to us at other Elizabeth Arden websites, or our co-promoter or sponsors may provide us with information, including PII, about users who choose to participate in a promotional opportunity the co-promoter or sponsor is offering in connection with Elizabeth Arden.</p>

<p>We will never disclose your PII to any third party who is not affiliated with, a business partner of or a sponsor of Elizabeth Arden without your express consent, except in the following circumstances: (i) in connection with the sale or merger of Elizabeth Arden or the division responsible for such services, (ii) as required by courts or administrative agencies, and (iii) to the extent required to permit us to investigate suspected fraud, harassment or other violations of any law, rule or regulation, the Site rules or policies, or the rights of third parties or any other suspected conduct we deem improper.</p>

<p><b>2. Non-Personally Identifying Information.</b></p>

<p>Elizabeth Arden may use and disclose Aggregate Information to improve and enhance your experience on the Site and for other purposes.  For example, from time to time, we may use and share Aggregate Information with third parties to show general demographic and preference information among users of the Site.  In these circumstances, the shared information will neither contain nor be linked to any PII.</p>

<p>We use a third-party service provider to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on this site. They may collect anonymous information about your visits to our website and your interaction with our products and services. They may also use information about your visits to this and other websites associated with the network advertiser to target advertisements for goods and services. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag, which is industry standard technology used by most major websites. No personally identifiable information is collected or used in this process. They do not know the name, phone number, address, email address, or any personally identifying information about the user. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this anonymous information used by our third party service provider, please <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>

<p><b><u>SPECIAL NOTICE REGARDING CHILDREN UNDER 18 YEARS OLD</u></b></p>

<p>We do not sell or ship any items ordered through this Site directly to anyone who we know to be under the age of 18, nor do we collect any personal information from anyone who we know to be under the age of 18.  If you are under the age of 18, you should use this Site only with the involvement of a parent or guardian and should not submit any personal information to us.</p>

<p><b><u>OPT-OUT POLICY</u></b></p>

<p>If you wish for us to remove your PII from our active records, please go to the "Click here to unsubscribe" link on www.shop.elizabetharden.com.  Please be aware that we will process your request within a reasonable time after receipt.  You should also be aware that we are not responsible for removing your PII from the lists of any third party who has previously been provided with your information in accordance with this policy, such as a business partner.  In addition, your ability to opt-out from receiving marketing and promotional material does not change our right to contact you regarding your use of the Site or changes to our Privacy Policy, Terms and Conditions of Use statement or other policy or terms that affect you and your use of the Site.</p>

<p><b><u>SECURITY</u></b></p>

<p>The security of your PII is very important to us.  We have put in place reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect, including limiting access to the PII contained on our servers.  Only those employees who need access to your information to perform their duties are authorized to have access to your PII.  In addition, various security measures, including Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology, are used to protect personal information that we collect. If you place an order through this Site, you will be asked to set up an account and provide an email address and password. You must provide an appropriate email address and password in order to access account information. In order to help protect your personal information further, you should be careful about providing your password to others. If you wish to cancel your password, or if you become aware of any loss, theft or unauthorized use of your password, please contact this the Customer Service Department of this Site by email at <a href="mailto:customerservice@elizabetharden.com">customerservice@elizabetharden.com</a>.</p>

<p><b><u>LINKS TO AND FROM OTHER WEBSITES</u></b></p>

<p>The Site may contain links to other websites not maintained by Elizabeth Arden, and other websites may reference or link to the Site.  These other websites may set their own cookies, collect data, solicit PII, and/or have their own privacy policies.  We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Site and to read the privacy policies and terms and conditions of each and every website you visit.  Elizabeth Arden is not responsible for the practices or the content of other such websites, expressly disclaims any statements or assertions made on such websites, and denies all liability associated with your use of, and the content on, other such sites.</p>

<p><b><u>CONSENT TO TRANSFER</u></b></p>

<p>The site is maintained in the United States of America.  If you are located in the European Union, Canada or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to the United States.  By using the Site, participating in any of our services, and/or providing us with your information, you consent to this transfer.</p>

<p><b><u>ACCEPTANCE AND CHANGES TO POLICY</u></b></p>

<p>By visiting the Site, you agree to the terms and conditions of the Privacy Policy.  Elizabeth Arden reserves the right to change, modify, alter or otherwise update this Privacy Policy at any time without notice.  We will post any changes here, so be sure to visit this page often.  If at any time in the future we plan to use your PII in a way that differs from this policy, we will post such changes here and provide you the opportunity to opt-out of such differing uses.  Your continued use of the Site after we post any changes to this Privacy Policy means you accept such changes.</p>

<p><b><u>CONTACT US</u></b></p>

<p>If you have any questions, comments or concerns about our privacy practices or this Privacy Policy, you may contact us at: customerservice@elizabetharden.com.  Any comments or feedback you provide shall be deemed to be non-confidential and Elizabeth Arden shall be free to use such information on an unrestricted basis.</p>
