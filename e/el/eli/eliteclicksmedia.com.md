In order to use all of the features and functionality that are provided by ELITECLICKSMEDIA's websites, you need to accept cookies. (b) Web Beacons: A web beacon is a programming code that may be used to display an image on a web page, but may also be used to transfer your unique user identification to a database and associate you with previously acquired information in a database. This allows ELITECLICKSMEDIA to track preferred websites you visit to aggregate pertinent data. Web beacons are used to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes to determine products or services you may be interested in. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, ELITECLICKSMEDIA also uses web beacons in most email messages sent to those listed in ELITECLICKSMEDIA's database. (c) IP Addresses: ELITECLICKSMEDIA automatically tracks certain information based upon your behavior on the site.

This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on the site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on the site or not), your computer browser information, and your IP address. Your Internet Protocol ("IP") is a unique Internet "address" which is assigned to you by an Internet Service Provider ("ISP"). For local area network ("LAN"), DSL, or cable modem users, an IP address may be permanently assigned to a specific computer. IP addresses are automatically logged by Web servers that collect information about a user's preferred traffic patterns. While the IP address does not identify an individual by name, it may, with the cooperation of the ISP, be used to locate and identify an individual using the Web. Your IP address can, however, reveal what geographic area you are connecting from, or which ISP you are using. Finally, other websites you visit have IP addresses, and we may collect the IP addresses of those websites and their pages. (d) Computer Profiles: ELITECLICKSMEDIA may also collect and accumulate other data which may be deemed as pertinent to help us understand, improve and analyze the Internet experience of our visitors.
