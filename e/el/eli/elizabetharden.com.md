# Elizabeth Arden Official Site Privacy Policy

Elizabeth Arden, Inc. ("we" or "Elizabeth Arden") has created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy. This policy sets forth our information collection and use practices only for the website located at www.elizabetharden.com (the "Site"), our US-directed electronic and social media platforms and applications, our promotions, sweepstakes, contests, surveys, and events in the United States, and our retail counters in the United States to the extent such information is shared with Elizabeth Arden (collectively, the “EA Channels”). If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, you may not access, participate in, or otherwise use the EA Channels. We also direct you to the respective Terms & Conditions statements which govern your use of, or participation in, each of the EA Channels. 

##### INFORMATION ELIZABETH ARDEN COLLECTS AND HOW WE USE IT

###### Personally Identifiable Information

When using or participating in the EA Channels, we may ask and you may volunteer to provide us with personal information ("PI"). PI is any information that concerns you individually and would permit someone to contact you. PI can include your name, billing address, shipping address, e-mail address, telephone number or mobile telephone number, date of birth, credit card information or information about other Elizabeth Arden products you have purchased. For example, we may seek PI when you choose to open an account with us, purchase a product, or participate in a contest, sweepstakes, or other promotional event. If you e-mail Elizabeth Arden or contact the Consumer or Customer Service hotline, we may collect PI during these communications as well. 

Collecting PI can assist us to determine how best to provide useful information to customers and to determine which of our products or services are of the most interest to them. We may also ask you to create a screen name and/or a password, where applicable, and provide us with demographic information (such as information about your age or gender), information regarding your interests, or similar information.

PI will only be collected when it is voluntarily provided to Elizabeth Arden. You can always choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of or participate in certain features of the EA Channels.

###### Non-personally Identifiable Information

As is true with most websites, we may also collect from you non-personally identifiable or anonymous information when you visit the Site, such as an IP host address, the browser type, the Site usage, and other data which do not identify any individual ("Aggregate Information").When your computer contacts our web servers (for example, when you visit the Site, view an HTML e-mail, or download an interactive desktop from the Site), Aggregate Information may be collected automatically. Said Aggregate Information may include the date and time you accessed the Site, the pages you viewed and the internet address of the website, if any, from which you linked directly to this Site. We also may determine the applicable technology available to serve you the most appropriate version of a web page, e-mail or similar service.

##### USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION BY ELIZABETH ARDEN ONLINE

##### HOW ELIZABETH ARDEN USES THE INFORMATION IT COLLECTS

1 .Personally Identifiable Information.

PI submitted to us is used to deliver the products or services you request, to keep you informed about changes affecting our services or your account, to inform you of products, including product launches, promotions, sweepstakes or offers services from Elizabeth Arden (such as through personalized messages) in which you might be interested, and to improve and enhance the Site and services. There are also times when we may make certain PI available to companies that have a strategic relationship with or perform services to you on our behalf. For instance, such companies may help us process information, extend credit, fulfill customer orders, deliver products to you, manage our data or provide customer service. Without making the information available to these third party companies, it would be very difficult for you to purchase products, receive customer service or provide us feedback on the content of this Site. If you provide PI to Elizabeth Arden, our partners and we will take all reasonable and appropriate steps to protect it from unauthorized disclosure.

In addition to the uses of PI explained above, by giving Elizabeth Arden your telephone and/or mobile telephone number, you expressly authorize Elizabeth Arden to contact you by telephone. If the number you provide is for a mobile telephone, please be aware that your wireless carrier may charge you for the receipt of such messages, and other charges may apply. If you do not want to receive such messages, you should not provide us with your telephone or mobile telephone number. 

We may conduct joint promotions and/or joint advertising with other companies. We may share with our promotional and advertising partners (and their service providers) certain PI as necessary to conduct the promotion and/or advertising. We will not share this information with our promotional/advertising partners for any other purpose unless you provide us with your consent to do so. We do not sell or rent your PI to other marketers.

We will never disclose your PI to any third party who is not affiliated with, a business partner of or a sponsor of Elizabeth Arden without your express consent, except in the following circumstances: (i) in connection with the sale or merger of Elizabeth Arden or the division responsible for such services, (ii) as required by courts or administrative agencies, and (iii) to the extent required to permit us to investigate suspected fraud, harassment or other violations of any law, rule or regulation, the rules or policies of the EA Channels, or the rights of third parties or any other suspected conduct we deem improper.

If you so choose, Elizabeth Arden, directly or through a service provider, may use the information you provide to create and deliver to you emails containing our products, or other email messages containing product and event information, promotions or other information we believe may be beneficial to our customers. Please note that if you choose to receive these e-mails, you always have the option to unsubscribe or limit the amount of e-mails you receive.

2\. Non-Personally Identifying Information.

Elizabeth Arden may use and disclose Aggregate Information to improve and enhance your experience on the Site and for other purposes. For example, from time to time, we may use and share Aggregate Information with third parties to show general demographic and preference information among users of the Site. In these circumstances, the shared information will neither contain nor be linked to any PI.

We use a third-party service provider to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on this site. They may collect anonymous information about your visits to our website and your interaction with our products and services. They may also use information about your visits to this and other websites associated with the network advertiser to target advertisements for goods and services. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag, which is industry standard technology used by most major websites. No personally identifiable information is collected or used in this process. They do not know the name, phone number, address, email address, or any personally identifying information about the user.

The Site may also use anonymous browsing information collected by its server mainly to help it administer and improve its website.

3\. Cookies and Tracking Technology

The Site may use browser "cookies." Cookies are pieces of information that may be placed on your computer by a website for the purpose of facilitating and enhancing your communication and interaction with a particular website. We may use cookies to customize your visit to the Site and for other purposes to make your visit more convenient or to enable us to enhance our service. For example, we may use cookies when we conduct polls or contests to limit multiple responses and registrations, or we may use cookies to track usage patterns on the Site or to analyze web activity. You may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or remove them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences. If you do so, you may still use the Site, but it may interfere with some of its functionality. We do not use cookies to automatically retrieve PI from your computer without your knowledge.

In addition to cookies, the Site uses a variety of technical methods for tracking purposes, including web beacons. Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of websites. Elizabeth Arden also uses these technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on the Site, such as the frequency with which our users visit various parts of the Site.

4\. California Do Not Track Notice

Under California law, website and online service operators are required to disclose how they respond to web browser “do not track” signals or similar mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personal information about a consumer’s online activities over time and across third party websites, to the extent the operator engages in that collection. At this time, we do not track our customer’s personal information over time and across third-party websites and therefore this requirement does not apply to us.

California law also requires website and online service operators to disclose whether third parties may collect personal information about their users’ online activities over time and across different sites when the users use the operator’s website or service. Third parties that have content or services on our site, such as an analytics service or an advertising network partner, may obtain information about your browsing or usage habits but this information does not include personal information. We do not knowingly permit such third parties to collect any personal information from our site unless you directly provide it to us and we provide it to them with your consent.

##### COREMETRICS

We are continuously working to make your experience on our Site better. To this end, we have retained a company, Coremetrics, to assist us in better understanding your use of our Site. Coremetrics will place cookies on your computer to collect information on our behalf that will show us how you come to our Site and how you use and navigate our Site. Coremetrics does not collect any personal information about you. Coremetrics analyzes the information it collects on our behalf via a unique random number and returns it back to us through a secure web connection. The information and analysis will be used to help us better understand your interests and to better serve you through a customized web experience and personalized product offerings. Coremetrics is contractually prohibited from using our data for any other purpose. Coremetrics is required to maintain all information collected on our behalf in confidence.

You should also be aware that we are not responsible for removing your e-mail or PI from the lists of any third party who has previously been provided with your information in accordance with this policy, such as a business partner. In addition, your ability to opt-out from receiving marketing and promotional material does not change our right to contact you regarding your use of the EA Channels or changes to our Privacy Policy, Terms and Conditions of Use statements or other policy or terms that affect you and your use of the EA Channels.

##### COMPLIANCE WITH LAW AND FRAUD PROTECTION

We may disclose any information we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request.
