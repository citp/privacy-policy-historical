<p>

<p>
	1. e. Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Information Collected Using Technology:</p>
<p>
	ELITECLICKSMEDIA like many large websites uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about you with information about you in its database to provide a much smoother and more user friendly experience. ELITECLICKSMEDIA may use other cutting edge and revolutionary sources of information in the future. (a) Cookies: "Cookies" are a feature on your browser software. If enabled, we may use cookies that may store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to any of the pages of this Site. Cookies help us in tracking which of our features appeal the most to you and what content you found the most interesting on past visits. When you visit this site again, cookies can enable us to customize our content according to your personal preferences. Cookies may be used to: keep track of the amount of return visits to this site; accumulate and report aggregate data, statistical information on website usage; deliver specific content to you based on your interests or past viewing history; save your password for ease of access to our Site. The user may disable cookies at any time, although the Site may not function as easily for you. User browser preferences can be modified to accept or reject all cookies, or to request a notification when a cookie is set. You may read more about cookies at <a href="http://cookiecentral.com" target="_blank" title="http://cookiecentral.com">http://cookiecentral.com</a>. In order to use all of the features and functionality that are provided by ELITECLICKSMEDIA's websites, you need to accept cookies. (b) Web Beacons: A web beacon is a programming code that may be used to display an image on a web page, but may also be used to transfer your unique user identification to a database and associate you with previously acquired information in a database. This allows ELITECLICKSMEDIA to track preferred websites you visit to aggregate pertinent data. Web beacons are used to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes to determine products or services you may be interested in. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, ELITECLICKSMEDIA also uses web beacons in most email messages sent to those listed in ELITECLICKSMEDIA's database. (c) IP Addresses: ELITECLICKSMEDIA automatically tracks certain information based upon your behavior on the site. This information may be used to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and greatly improve user experience. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on the site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on the site or not), your computer browser information, and your IP address. Your Internet Protocol ("IP") is a unique Internet "address" which is assigned to you by an Internet Service Provider ("ISP"). For local area network ("LAN"), DSL, or cable modem users, an IP address may be permanently assigned to a specific computer. IP addresses are automatically logged by Web servers that collect information about a user's preferred traffic patterns. While the IP address does not identify an individual by name, it may, with the cooperation of the ISP, be used to locate and identify an individual using the Web. Your IP address can, however, reveal what geographic area you are connecting from, or which ISP you are using. Finally, other websites you visit have IP addresses, and we may collect the IP addresses of those websites and their pages. (d) Computer Profiles: ELITECLICKSMEDIA may also collect and accumulate other data which may be deemed as pertinent to help us understand, improve and analyze the Internet experience of our visitors. For instance, ELITECLICKSMEDIA may passively acquire visitor data relating to referring domain names, the type of browsers used, operating system software, screen resolutions, color capabilities, browser plug-ins, language settings, cookie preferences, search engine keywords and JavaScript enablement. When you provide us with Personal Identification Information, we are able to use such visitor data to identify you. (e) Data Mining: Data Mining technology may be employed from time to time if used by a Client of ELITECLICKSMEDIA. (f) New Technology: The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly developing. As a result, ELITECLICKSMEDIA strongly encourages individuals to consistently revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of new technology.</p>
<p>
