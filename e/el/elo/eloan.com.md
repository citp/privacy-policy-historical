 FAC TS              DO WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
 Why?                Financial companies choose how they share your personal information. Federal law gives consumers the right
                     to limit some but not all sharing. Federal law also requires us to tell you how we collect, share, and protect
                     your personal information. Please read this notice carefully to understand what we do.
