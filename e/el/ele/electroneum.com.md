### 1\. What personal information do we collect and how do we collect it?

Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual who can be identified. It does not include data where an individual cannot be identified (anonymous data). We collect personal information from you in the following ways.

1.1. **Form information**. This is information about you (such as your name, address, email address, ETN and other cryptocurrency wallet addresses, mobile phone number, the route by which you were referred to us, and your alias) that you give us when filling in forms or using our services and digital content whether on our website or elsewhere. This could include, for example, forms which you complete to register for our services, place an order, sign-up for a newsletter or enter a competition.

1.2. **Content**. This is information about you which you provide when you post content on our website. This may include support desk comments, photographs, videos, blog posts, and other content which you post on our website.

1.3. **Emails and records of other contact**. This is information you provide when you contact us (for example by email, post or SMS) or when you respond to correspondence from us. This may include enquiries about our services, follow-up comments or complaints.

1.4. **Technical information**. This is information about you which is collected via technical means such as your IP address, cookies, webpage counters and other analytics tools.

1.5. **Visitor information**. We collect information about visitors to our premises. We may record information on your visit, including the date and time, who you are visiting, your name, employer, contact details and vehicle registration number. If you have an accident at our premises, this may include an account of your accident.

1.6. **Caller information**. We may collect details of phone numbers used to call our organisation and the date, time and duration of any calls. Please note that if we record your calls to or from us, we will inform you of this.

1.7. **CCTV**. We operate CCTV at our premises which may record you and your activities. We display notices to make it clear that surveillance is in operation.

1.8. **Employee information**. If you work for one of our customers, suppliers or business partners, the information we collect about you may include your contact information, details of your employment and our relationship with you.

1.9. **Information we receive from third parties**. As well as the information listed above, we may also receive the following types of personal information about you from the following sources:

> 1.9.1. Our other channels. This is information we receive about you if you use any of the other websites we operate or the other services or products we provide. In this case we will have informed you when we collected that data if we intend to share those data internally and combine it with data collected on this website. We will also have told you for what purpose we will share and combine your data.
> 
> 1.9.2. Our service providers. We work closely with third parties (including, for example, business partners, sub-contractors in technical, payment and delivery services, advertising networks, analytics providers, search information providers and credit reference agencies) who may provide us with information about you.

>

* * *

### 2\. Blockchain and personal information

2.1. The services we provide operate using distributed ledger technology, also known as ‘blockchain’.

2.2. Our cryptocurrency, “ETN”, uses a blockchain which is a public ledger of transactions and when you transact with third parties using ETN, each user of our network independently verifies the validity of your transactions. In doing so the data relating to your transactions, including your public keys, is shared with each user of our network.

2.3. As part of the services provided by Electroneum Group, it makes online and offline wallets available to you (for more information on this, please see our Terms and Conditions for the Provision of Services and Digital Content and Best Practice guidance . Each wallet uses a public key, You cannot be directly identified from your public key or wallet address.

2.4. Your transactions are “hashed” in order to “pseudonymise” your personal information. This means that we process (by using the hashing function) your transactions so that the personal data contained within them cannot be attributed to any specific individual without using additional identifying information.

2.5. The act of pseudonymising your personal information makes it very difficult for any third party to identify you from your public key or your transaction history, however this data is still considered to be personal data under data protection laws.

2.6. Each user of the ETN blockchain determines the purposes and means by which transaction information is processed and therefore acts as a data controller in their own right. Each user of ETN’s blockchain is solely responsible for its own compliance with relevant data protection laws.

2.7. To the extent that we do determine the purposes and means by which your personal information is processed, we will comply with all relevant data protection laws which apply in England and Wales.

2.8. Our services facilitate the sending and receiving of ETN between users and cannot function without the data sharing element of blockchain technology. We do not control the ongoing state of Electroneum’s blockchain or the information stored on it as we are not a party to these transactions.

In all other instances, we will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

### 9\. Your rights

9.1. Data protection law gives you a number of rights when it comes to personal information we hold about you. The key rights are set out below. More information about your rights can be obtained from the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:

> 9.1.1. **Be informed** in a clear, transparent and easily understandable way about how we use your personal information and about your rights. This is why we are providing you with the information in this notice. If you require any further information about how we use your personal information, please let us know.
> 
> 9.1.2. **Request access** to your personal information (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
> 
> 9.1.3. **Request correction** of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.
> 
> 9.1.4. **Request erasure** of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it (for instance, we may need to continue using your personal data to comply with our legal obligations). You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).
> 
> 9.1.5. **Object to processing** of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to us using your information on this basis and we do not have a compelling legitimate basis for doing so which overrides your rights, interests and freedoms (for instance, we may need it to defend a legal claim). You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.
> 
> 9.1.6. **Request the restriction of processing** of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.
> 
> 9.1.7. **Request the transfer** of your personal information to another party where you provided it to us and we are using it based on your consent, or to carry out a contract with you, and we process it using automated means.
> 
> 9.1.8. **Withdraw consent**. In the limited circumstances where we are relying on your consent (as opposed to the other bases set out above) to the collection, processing and transfer of your personal information for a specific purpose, you have the right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time. Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose or purposes you originally agreed to, unless we have another legitimate interest in doing so.
> 
> 9.1.9. **Lodge a complaint**. If you think that we are using your information in a way which breaches data protection law, you have the right to lodge a complaint with your national data protection supervisory authority (if you are in the UK, this will be the ICO). If you want to review, verify, correct or request erasure of your personal information, object to the processing of your personal information, withdraw your consent to the processing of your personal information or request that we transfer a copy of your personal information to another party, please contact us via [https://support.electroneum.com](https://support.electroneum.com/).

9.2. **Marketing Purposes**.   
In addition to the rights set out above, you also have the right to ask us not to process your personal information for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your personal information) if we intend to use your personal information for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your personal information. You can exercise the right at any time by contacting us in writing. You can also use the unsubscribe option in our marketing emails to unsubscribe from further marketing emails. Please note that where you unsubscribe from any postal marketing, you may initially still receive some content which has already been printed or sent, but we will remove you from any future campaigns.

9.3. **No fee usually required**.   
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.

9.4. **What we may need from you**.   
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.

9.5. **Timescale**.   
Please consider your request responsibly before submitting it. We will respond to your request as soon as we can. Generally, this will be within one month from when we receive your request but, if the request is going to take longer to deal with, we will let you know.
