# Elephant Auto Insurance | Privacy & Security

Elephant Insurance collects customer information to help us to serve you better. We are committed to protecting your privacy by maintaining and using this information responsibly. This privacy policy addresses the use and disclosure of personal information we collect from you. By visiting our website, or providing your information to us, you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy.

## What information do you collect about me?

  * We collect information about you to provide a rate quote and service your insurance policy. This information that identifies you is known as "Nonpublic Personal Information" because it identifies you and is not available to the public. We collect this information from the following sources: 

    * ### Application Information:

You provide this on your application by phone or online. We may also obtain it from outside sources. It may include your name, street address, phone number, e-mail address, driver's license number, Social Security number (optional), date of birth, gender, marital status, vehicle information, and information about other drivers. 
    * ### Consumer Report Information: 

We obtain this information from consumer reporting agencies. It includes your driving record, claims history with other insurers, and credit report information. The information is kept by the consumer reporting agencies and disclosed by them to others as permitted by law. It is a "soft" hit on your credit and does not affect your score. 
    * ### Web site information:

This information is unique to Internet transactions. It includes the Web site that linked you to ours, your computer operating system, and the pages you viewed on our site. Some Web sites, including ours, may also store "cookies" on your computer. Cookies collect technical data, like your Internet protocol (IP) address, operating system, and session ID. They may also save certain information entered by you.

## How will you share this information about me? 

  * We will share information about you only as permitted by law. We will not share your Nonpublic Personal Information with other companies for their marketing purposes without your consent. There is no need to "opt out" or tell us not to share this information.

We will disclose this Nonpublic Personal information when required to provide claims service, customer service, or comply with the law. Potential recipients include, for example, claims representatives, service providers, law enforcement, and consumer reporting agencies. These parties may disclose the information to others as permitted by law.

## How do you protect my information? 

  * We restrict access to your Nonpublic Personal Information to our employees and others who must use it to provide our products and services. Their use of the information is limited by law, and written agreements where appropriate. We also maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your information.

## How can I review and correct information about me? 

  * To review credit information used in developing your insurance score, send a written request to: ChoicePoint Insurance Consumer Center, PO Box 105289, Atlanta, GA 30348. You may also order a copy at www.consumerdislosure.com or by telephone at 800-456-6004.

To review non-credit information (reports of accidents or violations) used in developing your insurance rate, send a written request to: ChoicePoint Insurance Consumer Center, PO Box 105292, Atlanta, GA 30348. You may also order a copy of your report at www.consumerdisclosure.com or by telephone at 800-456-6004.

Upon review of your report(s), you may want to challenge the accuracy of specific information. ChoicePoint Insurance Consumer Center associates will help you clarify or amend your C.L.U.E. report. They will verify the information with the reporting insurance company and notify you of the results within 30 days. Also, if your C.L.U.E. report contains items you feel deserve an explanation, you may add your personal statement to the C.L.U.E. report. This personal statement may be included in all future C.L.U.E. reports.

ChoicePoint can also assist you with disputing items on your credit report. If you dispute information on your credit report and the credit bureau's investigation does not satisfactorily resolve it, you can request the addition of a consumer statement of up to 100 words (and sometimes more depending on the state in which you reside). This request is handled through the credit bureau that reported the information. 

ChoicePoint is considered a Consumer Reporting Agency under the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act and related state laws ("FCRA"), but ChoicePoint is not a credit bureau or insurance company. ChoicePoint does not make credit decisions or determine insurance underwriting guidelines. Their role is to supply information to Elephant Insurance Company, which Elephant Insurance Company reviews for assistance in making underwriting decisions.
