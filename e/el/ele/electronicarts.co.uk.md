# EA.com Privacy Policy

Electronic Arts (EA) and its subsidiary companies respect the privacy rights of our online visitors and recognize the importance of protecting the information collected about you. We have adopted a corporate wide Online Privacy Policy that guides how we collect, store and use the information you provide online. 

This Privacy Statement and the certification seal located above right confirms that Electronic Arts is a valid licensee and participating member in the Entertainment Software Rating Board's Privacy Online Program: ESRB Privacy Online. To protect your privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this privacy initiative and all of our web sites have been reviewed and certified by ESRB Privacy Online to meet established online information collection and use practices. As part of this privacy program, we are subject to frequent audits of our sites and other enforcement and accountability mechanisms administered independently by ESRB.

ESRB Privacy Online is a third-party seal provider whose mission is to protect consumers' online privacy and make the Internet a secure, reliable, and private place to share information and conduct business. ESRB Privacy Online promotes and enforces established principles and guidelines for fair information practices that include requirements of full disclosure, notice, and informed consent.

Whenever you visit a web site that displays the ESRB Privacy Online certification seal, you can expect to be notified of: 

  * Exactly what personal information may be collected and by what means 
  * Whether information is collected from children aged 12 and under 
  * Who, if anyone, is collecting your personal information 
  * How this information may be used, including, who - if anyone - it might be shared with 
  * The consequences - if any - resulting from your refusal to provide personal information 
  * How you can access and, if necessary, change the personal information a company maintains 
  * How a company ensures data security, quality, and integrity 
  * Where and how to ask questions or file complaints 



If you have any questions, complaints, or comments regarding our privacy statement or policies, please contact the Privacy Policy Administrator at (512) 434-6653, or email at [privacy_policy@ea.com](mailto:privacy_policy@ea.com). You can also contact ESRB Privacy Online directly at (212) 759-0700 or by regular mail at 845 Third Avenue, New York, NY 10022.

This privacy policy applies to the following web sites operated by Electronic Arts:

In addition, Electronic Arts owns several other domain names that point to the web sites listed above, and we will from time to time add new sites that may or may not be listed above. Please note that this policy applies only to sites maintained by Electronic Arts or its subsidiaries, and not to web sites maintained by other companies or organizations to which we link. 

**What personal information is collected?**  
Personal information is information that may be used to contact you on-line or off-line. Electronic Arts only collects personal information from our online visitors on a voluntary basis and only during (1) contests (registration or claiming a prize), (2) warranty registration and/or during customer support or technical service requests, (3) player match up services, (4) registration for games or special game-specific event participation, (5) marketing surveys and email campaigns, (6) registration for membership on our sites, (7) when you order products on our Online Store, or (8) when you request services from third party service providers on our site. Information collected may include your name, e-mail address, phone number, home address and birth date. We do not require personal information to obtain access to any of our sites; however, you will not be able to access areas that require registration.

_EA's Online Store_  
Visitors purchasing goods and services through our online store will need to provide a valid credit card number and expiration date, in addition to name, mailing address(es), phone number and e-mail address.

_Job Postings_  
Electronic Arts allows for the online submission of resumes. Please note that the information (including personal information) collected from a resume is not subject to this privacy policy. However, we want to assure you that information obtained from your resume will be used solely for the purpose of accepting and evaluating your submission for a job.

Whatever the purpose may be, we will only collect information to the extent deemed reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests and our legitimate business objectives.

_Online Chat Rooms and Profiles_  
You may choose to disclose information about yourself in our online chat rooms or in creating user “profiles” when you play games on our sites. Information that you disclose in chat rooms or in “profile” information is public information, and there is no expectation of privacy or confidentiality in either place. Please see our [Terms of Service](http://www.ea.com/global/legal/tos.jsp) on this point and for other guidelines about posting content on our web sites. 

**A Special Note About Children 12 Years Old and Under**  
Electronic Arts encourages parents to spend time online with their children. We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses or phone numbers, without permission, when using the Internet. We recognize a special obligation to protect personal information obtained from young children. Therefore, with respect to children residing in certain jurisdictions, no information should be submitted nor posted to Electronic Arts' online sites by children 12 years of age or under. In order for children 12 years old and under in such jurisdictions to participate in online activities that require registration, we require prior written permission from a parent or guardian. A copy of our permission form can be found at http://www.ea.com/global/legal/register_child_fax.jsp This form must be signed by the child's parent or guardian and returned to Electronic Arts by fax at 1-800-881-1422 or by mailing to Electronic Arts, Inc., Privacy Policy Administrator, 5918 West Courtyard Dr., Austin, TX 78730. Children 12 and under may not participate on certain of our sites.

Once we have obtained parental consent, we only ask the child for personally identifiable information that is reasonably necessary for the child to participate in our online activities.

If for any reason you are concerned that your child's personally identifiable information maintained by Electronic Arts is not correct, or should you wish to have your child's name removed from our records, please contact us at [privacy_policy@ea.com](mailto:privacy_policy@ea.com) or call (512) 434-6653 or send a fax to 1-800-881-1422, and we will be happy to review, update or remove your child's information as appropriate. In Europe, please send an email to [privacy-uk@ea.com](mailto:privacy-uk@ea.com).

**What about cookies?**  
Cookies are small files downloaded to your computer to track movements within web sites. Certain of our sites use cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly. Also, we use cookies to deliver content specific to your interest and for other purposes. For example, certain of our sites use “cookies” or other methods to monitor website usage. We collect information on what games are played, how much time is spent playing the games and which ads or links are clicked. 

Certain of our sites use an outside ad company to display ads. These ads may contain cookies. Cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad companies, and we do not have access to this information. Aggregate consumer data may be shared with the advertising companies. Most browsers are automatically set to accept cookies. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. However some areas will not function properly if you do so. 

DoubleClick, the company that serves many of the ads that appear on the pogo.com site, may also collect information regarding your activities online, including the sites you visit. Other ad serving companies may also collect similar information. For more information on DoubleClick's services and how you can opt out of those services, please visit DoubleClick's website. For more information about the practices of some of the other large ad serving companies that may collect information on your use of the site, you may visit AdKnowledge, Avenue A and MediaPlex to view their privacy statements and opt out policies. 

**What happens to the information provided?**  
Electronic Arts does not disclose any personal information about registered children under 18 years of age to third parties, _regardless of parental consent_ , or share or disclose personal information other than as set forth in this policy, provided however, that in the event of a merger, acquisition, or the unlikely event of bankruptcy, management of Electronic Arts’ customer information may be transferred to its successor or assign.

If you register to become a member of EA.com (our online games service), and you are 18 years of age or older, your email address is also provided to our partner, America Online, Inc. and you are automatically registered for an AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) Account. AOL will email you directly concerning your AIM account. If you register to become a member of pogo.com, your user name is reserved for you on AOL, but your email address is not provided to AOL.

Members may register for other services from our site(s) (for example, MyPoints on pogo.com). If you opt in to any of these services, we may collect additional information requested by a service provider and pass this information, together with all other registration information (including personal information), to that service provider. Use of your information by a service provider will be governed by that service provider’s terms of service and privacy policy. We may also retain any additional information collected for use in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. Participation in these other related services is optional and is not required to play games on pogo.com or ea.com, or participate in any of our other web sites.

Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, such as AOL or other service providers, we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as Electronic Arts. We encourage you to review AOL's privacy policy, found at www.aol.com, and the privacy policies of any other service provider from whom you request services.

The personal information you provide will allow us to alert you to new products, features and enhancements; special offers; upgrade opportunities; and contests and events of interest. From time to time, we are approached by companies and organizations that provide products or services that we believe may be of interest to you, and we may provide your personal information to such third parties. We see this as a value-added service helping you to find useful products or services. We strive to limit use of the information you provide to those offers that we think you would appreciate receiving. You may opt out of this service. See the opt out information below.

We may use survey information in marketing surveys to select and direct advertising that is more likely to be of interest to a particular member. This information may be transmitted to an ad server owned by the advertising company (for example, on pogo. com, this is DoubleClick) to match members with ads that they are more likely to be interested in. However, we do not disclose any member's personal information to our advertisers without the member's consent. Participation in member surveys is entirely optional.

From time to time, Electronic Arts may employ third-party contractors, such as Digital Impact, to collect personal information on our behalf, or to provide email delivery, product or promotional fulfillment, or other services on our sites. When requesting these services, you may be asked to supply your name, mailing address, telephone number and email address. When our third-party contractors collect and/or have access to the personal information you provide when requesting such services from Electronic Arts, Electronic Arts requires that they adhere to our stated privacy policies and protect the confidentiality of personal information they collect or have access to in the course of their engagement by Electronic Arts.

Finally, we may use your personal information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can consistently improve our sites to better meet our visitors' needs. To enforce legal rights and the law, or when we have reason to believe that the disclosure is necessary to address potential or actual injury or interference with our rights, property, operations, users or others who may be harmed, we may also disclose information to law enforcement, or the appropriate civil authorities.

**Opt-out Provision**  
When we first collect information about you, we will offer you the opportunity to opt-out of having your personal information shared with parties outside of Electronic Arts or its subsidiaries (except to the extent required by law, court order, or as requested by other government or law enforcement authority). In addition, if you do not want Electronic Arts to send you e-mail or postal mail about our products and services, you can opt out at the time of registration or information collection. If, at a later date, you choose to have your name removed from our mailing list, you can do so by sending an e-mail to [privacy_policy@ea.com](mailto:privacy_policy@ea.com), by calling (512) 434-6653 or by sending a fax to 1-800-881-1422. In Europe please send an email to [privacy-uk@ea.com](mailto:privacy-uk@ea.com). You may also click the unsubscribe link on our email offers and newsletters.

**Safeguarding Your Personal Information**  
We will only collect personal information to the extent deemed reasonably necessary to serve our legitimate business purposes, and we will maintain appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of the information you have provided. In addition, we will take reasonable steps to assure that third parties to whom we transfer any data will provide sufficient protection of that personal information.

**Review, Correction of Your Information and Requesting Removal from Mailing Lists and Deactivating Your Account**  
If for any reason you are concerned that the personal information maintained by Electronic Arts is not correct, or should you wish to have your account(s) deactivated or be removed from our mailing list(s), please email us at [privacy_policy@ea.com](mailto:privacy_policy@ea.com), and we will be happy to review, update or remove information as appropriate. In Europe please send an email to [privacy-uk@ea.com](mailto:privacy-uk@ea.com). We may still retain your information in our files however, to resolve disputes, enforce our user agreement, and due to technical and legal requirements and constraints related to the security, integrity and operation of our websites.
