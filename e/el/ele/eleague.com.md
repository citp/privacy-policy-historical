  5. OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR PRIVACY 
    1. International Transfer 

We operate globally, so we do need to transfer your Information internationally. In particular, your Information will be transferred to and processed in the United States where many of our central databases operate. We use European Commission approved contract clauses to protect your Information, an appropriate Privacy Shield certification or a vendor's Processor Binding Corporate Rules. A copy of the relevant mechanism can be provided for your review on request to our Privacy Policy Coordinator using the details set out below.

    2. Data Security 

We have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures designed to help prevent unauthorized access, to maintain data security, and to use correctly the Information we collect online. These safeguards vary based on the sensitivity of the Information that we collect and store.

Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of Information, we cannot assure you that Information will never be disclosed, altered or destroyed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy policy.

    3. Retention of Your Information 

We keep details of users who have registered for a Service with us for as long as you use the Service and for up to 18 months afterwards.

If you make payments in connection with the Services, we keep payment data for 13 months after the date of payment.

If you contact us with support queries, we keep the data for between 3 and 18 months, depending on the nature of the query and whether you have registered with us for a Service.

Our cookies and other tracking technologies expire 13 months from the date after you give or renew consent for us to use these technologies.

Where we process Information for marketing purposes, we process the Information while you remain interested in the marketing (for example, where you open and read our offers) and for three years after that point. If you ask us to stop sending marketing we will keep your Information for a short period after this (to allow us to implement your requests). We also keep a record of the fact that you have asked us not to send you direct marketing or to process your Information indefinitely so that we can respect your request in the future.

Where we process Information for Service security purposes, we retain it for 6 months.

    4. Your Rights/How to Contact Us

In addition, you can object to the processing of your Information in some circumstances (in particular, where we do not have to process the Information to meet a contractual or other legal requirement).

These rights may be limited, for example if fulfilling your request would reveal Information about another person, or if you ask us to delete Information which we are required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate interests in keeping.

Where you have given consent to our using your Information for marketing, you can withdraw your consent at any time. You can also ask us not to carry out profiling for direct marketing purposes. You can opt out of receiving email newsletters and other marketing communications by following the opt-out instructions provided to you in those emails.
