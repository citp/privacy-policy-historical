Introduction  
Element K Corporation, on behalf of itself, and its affiliates and subsidiaries (“Element K”) is committed to providing security and protecting your privacy in the delivery of our online products and services. Our Privacy and Security Policy has been developed as a core component of our commitment to combine the finest quality products and services with the highest level of integrity in dealing with our customers. This policy guides how we collect and use information about customers, and we commit that it will be continuously assessed against new technologies, business practices and standards being enacted by other internet-based companies.

Cookies provide you the ability to re-enter the site without logging in if you have chosen the auto login option.

We may disclose your personal information to any outside contractors, related companies and/or other companies that we use to ship products, provide technical support, handle order processing and/or otherwise act on our behalf for the purpose of providing products and services.  We also report data related to sales of third-party authorized courseware to applicable vendors according to applicable training certification standards.
