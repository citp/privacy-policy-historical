#### Your data always belongs to you, and only you. We don’t make advertising deals or collect sensitive personal data. We’re funded directly by our users paying what they want for elementary OS and apps on AppCenter. And that’s how it should be.

## elementary OS

We do not collect any data from elementary OS. Your files, settings, and all other personal data remain on-device unless you explicitly share them with a third-party app or service.

### Online Accounts

elementary OS optionally integrates with online account providers such as Google, Last.fm, and FastMail via System Settings. Data from these providers may be retrieved and stored locally on your device to be used in apps such as Mail and Calendar. This data is not sent to elementary or shared with any third party.

#### What Data is Collected

After adding an online account, elementary OS may collect and store your name, email address, avatar, email messages, calendar events, contacts, photos, and files from your connected accounts locally on your device.

#### How Data is Used

Your data is stored locally on your device and never sent to elementary servers or any third parties. It is used to populate your local apps such as Mail, Calendar, Files, and Photos with your data.

#### Sharing Data

elementary OS does not share any data collected from your online accounts. The data is never sent to elementary or third-party servers.

### Cookies

**You can choose to disable or selectively turn off any cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings.**
