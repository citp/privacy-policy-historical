We determine the purpose of collection, use and disclosure of your Registration Data and, as such, are considered the data controller of this information. Because you, not we, determine the purposes for which Profile Information is collected, used and disclosed, we are not the data controller of Profile Information that you provide on your profile.

It is not intended that any sensitive personal data be collected on element14 and therefore you should not include any sensitive personal data (e.g. data relating to health, sexual orientation, religion, race or ethnic origin, political opinion) on your profile or otherwise on element14. 

During the course of your use of element14 you may pass information to us and/or other Contributors in the context of questions and comments and a dialogue may develop. The majority of this information will not be personal data but, to the extent that you do disclose any personal data during these sessions, that information is retained in accordance with this Policy. 

Any information exchanged during an online conversation you have with another Contributor may be _recorded,_ primarily for customer service, monitoring and security purposes, but, save for the tracking referred to below, the storing of emails on our servers of emails sent via element14 and the recordal of your registration and profile information, your participation in the element14 environment will not be recorded.

Your Registration Data and Profile Information is stored on a Group server located in the UK and it may be used by us or any other company in the Group:

  * For the purposes of your participation in element14, including contacting you in connection with any query you have raised;
  * If you have opted in, in order to contact you subsequently to inform you about other products, services or events on offer from Premier Farnell which we think may genuinely be of interest to you. We will always give you the option not to be contacted in this way or at all and you may exercise that option at any time; 
  * For administration purposes or to help us develop and improve our offering;

We require them to treat your personal information as confidential and to comply with applicable data protection legislation in handling your personal information.

Sometimes, in connection with the purposes outlined above, we may need to transfer your personal information to service providers and agents in countries (such as the USA) which do not provide the same level of data protection as you may be entitled to in your homeland. If we do make such a transfer we will put a contract in place to ensure your information is given the same level of protection as it would have had if it had remained in your country. 

Contributors may also be based in countries outside of the European Economic Area, including in the USA. When information is passed to any Contributor in accordance with the terms of this policy, that Contributor becomes responsible for safeguarding your data.

_For crime prevention, security or regulatory purposes_
