Accordingly, if you are concerned about your children’s activities or their privacy on our Services, we encourage you to contact our Legal Department as described below.</p>

			</ul>

			<p><strong>(c) Information We Collect From Other Sources. </strong>We may also obtain information from other sources, including but not limited to marketing and other promotional partners, and combine that with information we collect through our Services.&nbsp; Likewise, we may also obtain such personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information based upon the content you click on or have been shown by third-party platforms, social media sites, plug-ins, and other applications.

</ul>

<p>Elements is based in the United States and the information we collect is governed by U.S. law.&nbsp; By accessing or using the Services or otherwise providing information to us, you consent to the processing and transfer of information in and to the U.S. and other countries.</p>

<p><strong>3. Sharing of Information. </strong>We may share information about you as follows or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy:</p>

<ul>
	<li>With Franchise Owners, area directors, our shareholders, creditors, investors, board of directors, employees, agents and representatives working on our behalf;</li>
	<li>With vendors, consultants and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work on our behalf, including but not limited to credit card processing and order fulfillment if you choose to purchase products or services through the Services;</li>
	<li>With our affiliates, marketing partners, or other direct marketers, so they can send you notices about their products or services. If you do not want to receive email marketing communications, see “Preferences” below for opt-out information;</li>
	<li>In response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with any applicable law, regulation or legal process, or as otherwise required by any applicable law, rule or regulation;</li>

<p><strong>4. Security.</strong> Elements takes reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Because no data transmission over the Internet is completely secure, and no system of physical or electronic security is impenetrable, we cannot guarantee the security of the information you send to us or the security of our servers or databases, and by using the Services, you agree to assume all risk in connection with the information sent to us or collected by us when you use the Services.</p>

<p><strong>5. Preferences.</strong></p>

<p><strong>(b) Cookies &amp; Third-Parties. </strong>Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability or functionality of our Services. Likewise, Google, other third-party platforms, social media sites, plug-ins, and applications may provide account management tools related to how your information is used and shared from those sources; please consult their websites, platforms, and/or applications for more information about their policies and available tools.</p>

<p><strong>(c) Promotional Communications.</strong> You may opt out of receiving promotional emails from Elements by following the instructions in those emails. If you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account or our ongoing business relations. &nbsp;Franchise Owners may conduct their own promotional email communications; please consult their communications’ terms for information on opting out.</p>

<p><strong>6. Retention.</strong> Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary, Elements and/or Franchise Owners (as applicable) may retain certain information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes. Elements and/or Franchise Owners (as applicable) may also retain cached or achieved copies of information about you as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.</p>
