Last Updated: July 1, 2015

This Privacy Policy explains how information about you is collected, used and disclosed by Elements Therapeutic Massage, Inc and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies (“Elements”, “we” or “us”). This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect when you use our website (the “Services”) or when you otherwise interact with us. Please note that your visit to our website is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service.

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you an email notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.

MESSAGE TO PARENTS AND CHILDREN: The Services are not to be used by children, under the age of thirteen; and, no one under the age of thirteen is allowed to provide any personal information. Minors between the ages of thirteen and seventeen must get the permission of their parent(s) or legal guardian(s) before making any purchases or registering on the Services. We reserve the right to confirm that consent in our sole discretion. If children disclose information about themselves on the Services, they may get unsolicited messages from us and other parties. Accordingly, if you are concerned about your children’s activities or their privacy on our Services, we encourage you to contact our Legal Department as described below.

The types of information we may collect include your name, email address, postal address, phone number, fax number, credit card information, information about your family members (such as when you schedule an appointment for a family member), and any other information you choose to provide.

For more information about cookies, and how to disable them, please see “Preferences” below.



**(c) Information We Collect From Other Sources.**  We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Services.  Likewise, we may also obtain such personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information based upon the content you click on or have been shown by third-party social media sites, plug-ins, and applications. For example, we may collect information about you from third parties, including but not limited to identity verification services, credit bureaus, mailing list providers and publicly available sources, and if you  log into your account through a social media site, we will have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, photo, gender, birthday, location, interests, account information and friends lists, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such social media site. We may also receive information from Franchise Owners (as defined below) for various purposes, including but not limited to providing, maintaining, and improving our Services and the Elements Massage™ franchise system.

**(d) Information Collected by Other Parties.**  Elements is the owner of and operates the Elements Massage™ franchise system in which Elements studios (“Studios”) are each independently owned and operated by Elements franchise owners (“Franchise Owners”). Elements does not have any agency, partnership, employment, or joint venture relationship with any Franchise Owners. Franchise Owners may use third-party social media plug-ins, applications, and other content on the Services for their respective Studios (“Franchise Owner Content”) which may obtain and use your information and may have different privacy policies governing the use of your information. By accessing or using a Studios’ specific pages on the Services, you acknowledge that we do not control or bear any responsibility for the privacy policies, terms of use, security & data protection measures, or other policies of the Franchise Owner or any third parties associated with a Studios’ specific pages on the Services.

**2\. Use of Information.**  We may use information about you for various purposes, including to:

  * Provide, maintain and improve our Services;

  * With Franchise Owners;
  * With vendors, consultants and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work on our behalf;
  * With marketing partners or other direct marketers, so they can send you notices about their products or services. If you do not want to receive email marketing communications, see “Preferences” below for opt-out information;
  * In response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with any applicable law, regulation or legal process, or as otherwise required by any applicable law, rule or regulation;
  * If we believe your actions are inconsistent with the spirit or language of our user agreements or policies, or to protect the rights, property and safety of Elements or others;
  * In connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company; and
  * With your consent or at your direction, including if we notify you through our Services that the information you provide will be shared in a particular manner and you provide such information.



We may also share aggregated or de-identified information, which cannot reasonably be used to identify you.

**4\. Security.**  Elements takes reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Because no data transmission over the Internet is completely secure, and no system of physical or electronic security is impenetrable, we cannot guarantee the security of the information you send to us or the security of our servers or databases, and by using the Services, you agree to assume all risk in connection with the information sent to us or collected by us when you use the Services.

**5\. Preferences.**

If you wish to delete or deactivate your account, please contact the Franchise Owner who created your account or email us at legal@wellbizbrands.com, but note that we may retain certain information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes. We may also retain cached or achieved copies of information about you for a certain period of time.

**(b) Cookies.**  Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability or functionality of our Services.

**(c) Promotional Communications.**  You may opt out of receiving promotional emails from Elements by following the instructions in those emails. If you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account or our ongoing business relations.  Franchise Owners may conduct their own promotional email communications; please consult their communications’ terms for information on opting out.
