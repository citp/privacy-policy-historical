# ECS Privacy Policy

The Electrochemical Society (ECS) is committed to the value of your privacy. As you use our web site, you may be prompted to enter information when you:

  1. Create a user name and password 

  2. Use personalization features 

  3. Purchase a product or service 

  4. Sign up for a free product or service 

  5. Participate in online forums or discussions 

  6. Provide feedback 




The data collected online from an ECS user is voluntary, although some services are only accessible by registering user details. Information collected may include your name, e-mail address, street address, job title, society membership, or other related demographic information. Except as described in this Privacy Policy, ECS will endeavor to keep your information confidential. We focus on using the information as part of ECS's service to you and its mission to advance the knowledge of electrochemical and solid-state science and technology. 

**Notice to EU Users**   
The server for www.electrochem.org is located in the United States. By entering information on this site, you are consenting to the transfer of that information to the United States. Your information will be handled in accordance with the ECS Privacy Policy.

**How collected information is used**   
The primary purpose of gathering information is to allow ECS to link a name and contact information to a user ID or browsing experience. Once you have provided appropriate information, you will be enabled to use a variety of products or personalized services, and to access online help or support. ECS has a policy to use or sell its customer lists only for the delivery of information deemed of potential relevance or interest to members of the physics community. ECS offers an option to remove your information from any list that might be sold or given to another organization. 

**How we work to keep information secure **  
ECS takes precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, we make commercially reasonable efforts to protect your information both online and off-line. When our registration/order form asks for sensitive information (such as a credit card number), we use dedicated software designed to encrypt the information and protect it. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. 

**Opt-out for European Union and other users **  
In accordance with EU and other guidelines, you may decline to provide the information requested by ECS. Please be advised, however, that ECS may be unable to provide certain services unless such information is provided for security and identification purposes.

**Cookies**   
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive that sometimes links to personally identifiable information about the user. ECS occasionally uses session cookies which are designed not to be permanent or persistent. The session cookie is designed so that, once you close your browser, the cookie will simply terminate. If you configure your browser to reject cookies, you may still use some, but not all, portions of our site. For example, accessing our online journals requires that your browser accept cookies. We recommend closing browsers on publicly available machines (such as those in libraries) after use. 

**Disclosure of aggregated and other information**   
We use IP addresses and other user information to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We may share aggregated (i.e., non-individual) demographic information with our partners and advertisers. We use one or more outside credit card processing companies to bill users for goods and services and we will disclose your personally identifiable information to these companies as needed to process your orders and to respond to your requests

**Links**   
ECS sites contains links to other sites, and other sites have links to ECS. Please be aware that ECS is not responsible for the privacy practices (or other practices, goods, services, or content) of other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by ECS. 

**Notification of changes**   
If we make material changes to our privacy policy, these changes will be posted to our privacy policy page. You should review this page regularly for updates.
