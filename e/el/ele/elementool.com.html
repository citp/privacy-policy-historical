									employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our 
									billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to 
									personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected

									their password to re-gain access to their information. Furthermore, ALL 
									employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every

									and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do
