#### Last Updated: April 22, 2019

This Privacy Policy applies to all who visit and use our website, www.elysiumhealth.com, and online services as well as the websites and online services offered by our affiliates (collectively the “Site”).

This Privacy Policy explains how Elysium Health, Inc. (“Elysium Health”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) collects, uses, processes, and discloses your information.    

This Privacy Policy is incorporated into our Terms of Services, which also apply when you use our Site.  By visiting or using the Site, you agree to the terms in this Privacy Policy and consent to the collection, use, process, disclosure of your personal information and non-identifying information as described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the practices described in this Privacy Policy, please cease visiting the Site, do not provide us with your personal information, or otherwise interact with the Site. 

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make any material changes to our Privacy Policy, we will provide notice on this Site. We encourage you to periodically review the privacy policy for any modifications. Your use and continued use of any of our service after we post any amendments or modifications to this Privacy Policy will be deemed your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and its changes.  You can determine when this Privacy Policy was last revised by referring to the date it was “last updated” above.

### Information Collection

#### What Information We Collect?

**General:** When you visit and interact with our Site (including when you make a purchase through our Site), we may collect and you consent our collection of some or all of the following information directly from you and automatically as you use our services:

  * _Personal Information that you voluntarily provide to us_. “Personal Information” is information about you that specifically identifies you or, when combined with other information we have, can be used to identify you. It includes such things as name, address, company name, telephone number, email address, date of birth, and purchase and ordering history.
  * _Non-identifying information we collect when you use the Site_. “Non-identifying Information” is information that alone cannot identify you and has not been associated with you.  It includes such things as data from cookies or pixel tags, or data about the device you use to access, use, or interact with our Site, such as your IP address or the type of browser you are using.



Elysium Health does not collect sensitive Personal Information (e.g., information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, criminal background or trade union membership) without your express consent or as required or permitted by law.

Elysium Health may ask you to provide certain Personal Information at various times and places on the Site. In some cases, if you choose not to provide us with the requested Personal Information, you may not be able to access all of the Site or participate in all of its features.

For example, we may collect Personal Information from you when you:

**Non-Identifying Information:** We may use cookies, web beacons/pixel tags, and other technology (collectively “cookies”) to automatically collect anonymous, non-identifying information about you when you visit our Site or interact with our emails.

A “cookie” is a small text file that a website’s server places on a computer’s web browser. These cookies may be delivered in a first party or third party context. For example, we may collect information about your browser type and version, operating system, user language, ISP, viewed web pages, links that are clicked, IP address, the presence or absence of “flash” plug-ins, screen resolution, connection type, sites visited before and after visiting our Site, details about items purchased, and emails we send that you open, forward, or click through to our Site.

It is possible that one or more of our Sites that link to the Privacy Policy utilize flash cookies, otherwise known as local shared objects, to store your preferences or display personalized content based upon what you view on our Site. “Flash cookies” use technology to remember settings, preferences, and usage similar to browser cookies but these are managed through a different interface than your browser and are not disabled from your normal browser settings. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. Please see the last section under Cookies and Tracking for information on how to disable Flash cookies.

  * Better understand how you interact with our Site;
  * Give you a more personal and optimized online experience by tracking your preferences;
  * Improve our Site and services;
  * Fulfill contracts with our business partners;
  * Help confirm receipt of and response to our emails;
