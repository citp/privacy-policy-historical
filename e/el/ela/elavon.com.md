SERVICE PROVIDERS.  We may share personal and anonymous information with agents, subsidiaries, affiliates, partners and other third parties that perform functions on our behalf, such as hosting, billing, content management tools, analytics, customer service, fraud protection, etc.  These entities have access to the Personal Information needed to perform their functions and are obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of that Personal Information.  The Service Providers are restricted from using, selling, distributing or altering this data in any way other than to provide the requested services.

BUSINESS PARTNERS.  We provide products and services to customers through a number of affiliated banks and companies.  To the extent permitted under applicable laws, __ we may share your Personal Information with our business partners or other third parties that enable us to serve your processing needs.  We may contact our existing customers by mail, telephone, or email to offer additional products or services that we believe may be of interest to you.  Although our treatment of your Personal Information is governed by this Privacy Policy, the business partner or third party’s treatment of your Personal Information will be governed by the business partner or third party’s privacy policy. 

EMERGENCY SITUATIONS.  We may also use or disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to applicable law or comply with legal process served on us or the Site; (b) protect and defend our rights or property, the Site or our users, or (c) act under emergency circumstances to protect the personal safety of us, our affiliates, agents, or the users of the Site or the public.

SHARING ANONYMOUS INFORMATION.  To the extent permitted under applicable local laws, we may disclose or share Anonymous Information (or other information, other than Personal Information) in any other manner that we deem appropriate or necessary. Among other things, we may disclose Anonymous Information to third parties to help us determine how people use parts of the Site and who our users are so we can improve the Site. 

**WHAT STEPS DO WE TAKE TO KEEP PERSONAL INFORMATION SECURE**

The security of your Personal Information is important to us.  Personal Information collected by the Site is stored in operating environments that are not available to the public.  Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose your Personal Information to you. In certain telephone and in person transactions we may ask for your full Social Security number, account number or other information to verify your identity before conducting the transactions you have requested.  Note that Elavon will never initiate a request via email for your sensitive information (e.g., Social Security number, personal ID, password, PIN or account number).  If you receive an email asking for your sensitive information, you should be suspicious of the request and promptly contact us to report the suspicious activity.   Please understand, however, that while we try our best to safeguard your Personal Information once we receive it, no transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  We review our security procedures to consider appropriate technology and methods to secure information.

**WHAT ARE YOUR OBLIGATIONS IN USING THE SITE**

When using the Site, you promise to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself and your business, and (b) maintain and promptly update the registration information to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Elavon has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Elavon has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Site (or any portion thereof).  You are entirely responsible for the security and confidentiality of your password and account. Furthermore, you are entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account.

**WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU LINK TO OR FROM ANOTHER WEBSITE**

The Site may contain links to other websites operated by Elavon, affiliates of Elavon or third parties. Please be advised that the practices described in this Privacy Policy for Elavon do not apply to information gathered through third party websites, websites operated by affiliates of Elavon or websites operated by Elavon where this Privacy Policy is not posted.  Elavon does not guarantee and is not responsible for the actions and privacy policies of third parties or its affiliates or their websites and we therefore encourage you to familiarize yourself with the privacy policies provided by those parties.

**GOVERNING LAW**

The Site is intended for use in the United States of America. We attempt to protect the Personal Information of all users of the Site and we attempt to comply with local data protection and consumer rights laws to the extent they may apply to the Elavon services, but the Site is targeted to United States of America citizens and our policies are directed at compliance with those laws.  If you are uncertain whether this Privacy Policy conflicts with the applicable local privacy laws where you are located, you should not submit your Personal Information to Elavon.

**NOTICE TO NON US USERS**

If you are located outside the United States of America, you should be aware that your personal information will be transferred to the United States of America, the laws of which may differ from the laws of your country.

**RETENTION PERIOD**

We will retain your Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

**ASSIGNMENT**

We may change our ownership or corporate organization while providing the Site and services or sell certain assets associated with the Site. In such events, we will comply with applicable laws that govern the transfer of personal information in business transactions and provide with appropriate notification and choice, as required by law. As a result, please be aware that in such event and to the extent permitted by law we may transfer some or all of your information to a company acquiring all or part of our assets or to another company with which we have merged. Under such circumstances we would, to the extent possible, require the acquiring party to follow the practices described in this Privacy Policy, as it may be amended from time to time.  Nevertheless, to the extent permitted by law, we may not be able to promise that an acquiring company or the merged company will have the same privacy practices or treat your information the same as described in this Privacy Policy.
