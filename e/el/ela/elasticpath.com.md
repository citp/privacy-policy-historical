This Policy is intended to assist you in making informed decisions when using our website and is intended to establish responsible and transparent practices for the management of personal information and to satisfy the requirements of rules established by applicable privacy laws and standards in the jurisdictions where we operate.

We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the privacy statements provided by all third parties prior to providing them with information.

### What Information We Collect Using Cookies

A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit our website, we may collect technical information, using electronic means such as cookies. This information may include information about your visit to our website, including the IP address of your computer and which browser you used to view our website, your operating system, resolution of screen, location, language settings in browsers, the site you came from, keywords searched (if arriving from a search engine), the number of page views, information you entered, advertisements you have seen, etc. This data is used to measure and improve the effectiveness of our website or enhance the experience for our website users. For instance, it may be used to ensure that the products advertised on our website are available in your area or that we are not showing you the same ads repeatedly. We treat this information as personal information when it is associated with your account or contact information. For instance, we may collect and use the following type of information when you visit and/or interact with us on our websites:

**Google Analytics:** We use Google Analytics which allows us to see information on user website activities including, but not limited to, page views, source and time spent on our website. This information is depersonalized and is displayed as numbers, meaning that it cannot be tracked back to individuals.

**Google AdWords:** We use Google AdWords Remarketing to advertise Elastic Path across the Internet and to advertise on third party websites (including Google) to previous visitors to our websites. AdWords remarketing will display ads to you based on what parts of the website you have viewed by placing a cookie on your web browser. It could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven’t completed a task on our site or this could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google search results page, or a site in the Google Display Network. This cookie does not in any way identify you or give access to your computer or mobile device. The cookie is only used to indicate to other websites that you have visited a particular page on our website, so that they may show you ads relating to that page. If you do not wish to participate in our Google AdWords Remarketing, you can opt out directly with Google.

**Interest-based Advertising.** Elastic Path may also allow a limited number of cookies from trusted third parties to be installed on your hard drive directly from our website. Our website may include third-party advertising and links to other websites which may be used to generate personalized advertisements. Personalized ads, sometimes referred to as interest-based or behavioral ads, are ads based upon information about you, such as your page views on our website, your information requests or purchases on our websites. We do not provide any personal information to advertisers or to third party sites that display interest-based ads on our websites. However, advertisers and other third-parties (including the ad networks, ad-serving companies, and other service providers they may use) may assume that users who interact with or click on a personalized ad or content displayed on our websites are part of the group that the ad or content is directed towards. Advertisers or ad companies working on their behalf sometimes use technology to serve the ads that appear on our websites directly to your browser. They may also use cookies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize ad content. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features that advertisers and third party sites may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third party websites are not covered by this Policy. Please contact them directly for more information about their privacy practices.

  


### Sharing Your Information

Elastic Path will use the information you provide only for the purposes identified in this Policy. Elastic Path will only disclose information about you to its affiliated companies, business partners and authorized agents who assist us in performing our functions.

We will not sell or otherwise disclose information collected from you to other third parties, except in those limited cases where we are legally required to do so.

  


### Safeguards

Elastic Path has taken commercially reasonable steps to assure the security of any sensitive information that is transmitted to and from our website. We will cease all communication and use of your information upon your request. Your privileges for access to certain resources on this website may then be affected.
