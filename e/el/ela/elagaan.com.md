We do not sell or rent your personal or tax return information to anyone. We do not share your personal or tax return information with anyone outside of eLagaan for their promotional or marketing use. We do not share your tax return information inside of eLagaan for promotional or marketing use.

eLagaan uses your personal information to manage your account, to contact you and to operate, improve, and deliver our products and services, including Web sites. We use your personal information to provide you with information and services you request, to tell you about eLagaan products and services, and to give you a customized, interactive experience as you use our products.
