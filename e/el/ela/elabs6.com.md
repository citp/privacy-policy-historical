You can visit and navigate through our main, corporate Web Site ([www.lyris.com](http://www.lyris.com/)) to gather information about our company and Services without telling us who you are and without otherwise revealing any type of Personal Information.

Our website does offer several opportunities for visitors to register for free information, seminars, or demonstration copies of our software, and for assistance in evaluating our software and services.  These registration forms are often linked to Lyris mailing lists, and require users to provide Personal Information (such as name and e-mail address), which we use to send users information about our company and our products and services.  We also use this information to contact site visitors by e-mail for marketing purposes if they have granted us permission (on the mailing list form or other forms on our website) to send it to them, and for administrative purposes such as providing time and location of seminars.  Users may also be contacted by phone or postal mail for marketing purposes.

We use information that is not Personal Information (e.g., IP address) to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website.  IP addresses are also used to gather broad, personally non-identifiable demographic information, such the countries in our Web site visitors live.

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes.  We use cookies on this site.  We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.  We also have third party cookies and other tracking technologies on our site, of which data is only collected in the aggregate.

Our website contains testimonials that contain information such as Customer names and titles.  Lyris obtains the consent of each Customer prior to posting any information on such a list or posting testimonials.

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a colleague our site, we request to receive from you Personal Information about your friend and you, such as name, company name, email address, and phone number.  We only use this information to contact the referred colleague (once) to see if they wish to receive information from us and to track the success of our referral program.  This Personal Information is not otherwise used if the referred colleague does not wish to have contact from us.  If the referred person agrees to be contacted by Lyris, then their Personal Information is retained and used by us in the same way as we retain and use Personal Information as described above. 

Our Web site includes Widgets, which are interactive mini-programs that run on our site to provide specific services from another company _(_ e.g. displaying the news, opinions, music, etc _)._   Personal Information, such as your email address, may be collected through the Widget.  Cookies may also be set by the Widget to enable it to function properly.  Information collected by this Widget is governed by the privacy policy of the company that created it, which you can access by scrolling over the Widget.

We allow users to access Facebook Connect to interact with friends and to share on Facebook through Wall and friends' News Feeds.  If you are already logged into our Web site and Facebook, when you click on “Connect with Facebook” you will be prompted to merge your profiles.  If you are already logged into our Web site but not logged into Facebook, when you click on “Connect with Facebook” you will be prompted to enter your Facebook credentials or to “Sign up for Facebook.”  By proceeding, you are allowing our Web site to access your information and you are also agreeing to the Facebook Terms of Use in your use of our Web site.

Conversely, if you are not currently registered as a Lyris user and you click on “Sign in Using Facebook,” you will first be asked to enter your Facebook credentials and then be given the option to register and join our Web site.  Once you register on our Web site and Connect with Facebook, you will be able to automatically post recent activity back to Facebook.  You have the option to disable Facebook Connect at any time by logging into “My Profile” and clicking on “My Facebook Profile.”  Further, you can edit privacy settings for the reviews that appear on Facebook or disconnect this service by visiting the Facebook Application Settings page.
