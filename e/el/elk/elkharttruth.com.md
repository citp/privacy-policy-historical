Your information, including Personal Information, may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than those from your jurisdiction.

If you are located outside United States and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer the information, including Personal Information, to United States and process it there.

If you are a user accessing the Site from a jurisdiction with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure, that differ from United States laws, please be advised that through your continued use of the Site, which is governed by Tennessee law, this Privacy Policy, and our Terms of Use and Subscription Agreement, you expressly consent to be governed by Tennessee law in order to use the Site and for the purposes outlined above.

VI. SPECIAL NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS

Under the California Civil Code, residents of the State of California that have provided any Personal Information to Paxton Media have the right to request a list of all third parties to which Paxton Media has disclosed Personal Information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if Paxton Media has a privacy policy that gives either an opt-out or opt-in choice for use of Personal Information by third parties (such as advertisers or affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, Paxton Media may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options free of charge. Paxton Media qualifies for the alternative option and has adopted a policy of not disclosing the personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option that prevents that information from being disclosed to third parties for those purposes. It has established this Privacy Policy that provides you with details on how you may either opt-out of the use of your Personal Information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and would like to request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices, please send a request to webmaster@elkharttruth.com with a preference on how our response to your request should be sent.

VII. LINKS TO OTHER SITES

Our Site may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. Such websites are not investigated, monitored or checked for quality, accuracy or completeness by us. Inclusion of any linked website on the Site does not imply or express an approval or endorsement of the linked website by us, or of any of the content, opinions, products or services provided on these websites. We strongly advise you to review the privacy policy of every site you visit. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.

VIII. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY

Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. The Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”) defines a “Child” as anyone under the age of 13. Paxton Media strictly adheres to COPPA. For that reason, we do not collect or maintain information obtained through the Site from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of the Site is structured to attract anyone under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you learn that your Children have provided us with Personal Information, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Information from a children under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.
