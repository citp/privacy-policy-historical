## Personal Information collected from you

Elfster respects each individual user's right to privacy. Elfster collects personal information provided from users during site registration, contests, surveys or use of public areas. The personal information collected on the site includes your first and last name, email address, mailing address, mobile phone number, birthday and year, login name, password, and gender. You may also provide us photographs or other video materials, which may contain personal information. We may collect personal information when you register on, log on, or visit our Web sites, including when you participate in activities on our Web sites, such as sweepstakes, contests, games, and informational and promotional offers, and when you provide information to our customer service representatives.

## Use of Personal Information we collect

From time to time, we may share aggregated site traffic information with our partners and advertisers. Also, your information is visible to the person buying for you and people in your group in order to help them buy an appropriate gift and deliver that gift to you. If you come to Elfster and/or are using our services through a partnered branded site, such as the one with Claire’s Stores, we will share your data with that partner, and anyone acting on their behalf.

## Information collected from technology

In addition to information we ask from you specifically, our Web site also tracks some information passively. This information is collected in order to assure that our site runs smoothly, and that you have a good experience using Elfster services. When you visit our Web site, our Web server automatically recognizes the browser you are using, your IP address, the URL that referred you to our site, and all of the areas within our site that you visit. We use this information only in a general context that does not personally identify individual users but still allows us to analyze trends concerning our site and thus improve it accordingly.

## Cookies

Non-personal information and data may be automatically collected through the standard operation of Elfster's Internet servers (i.e. log file information like IP address) or through the use of "cookies." Cookies are small text files that our site places on your computer's hard drive to recognize repeat users and to facilitate your use of the site. Also, our cookies allow the tracking of site usage and the compilation of aggregate data for content improvement, targeted advertising, and marketing and promotional purposes.

Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). Users should be aware that Elfster cannot control the use of cookies or the resulting information by advertisers or other third parties. Most browsers allow a user to deny cookies; however, users should note that cookies may be required to provide certain web site features. Also, users may opt out of receiving those cookies using a resource such as the Network Advertising Initiative ([www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/)). The information collected in these cookies cannot be linked to personally identifiable information.

## Blogs

If you use a bulletin board, blog, or chat room on this Web site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.

## Third Party Advertising

Some of the ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to users by our Web advertising partners. Information about users' visits to this site, such as number of times they have viewed an ad (but not user name, address, or other personal information), is used to serve ads to users on this site. Please understand we have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for third parties to place advertising on elfster.com.

## Opt-In and Opt-Out

Once registered, users who no longer wish to receive general communications may opt-out of (i.e., discontinue receiving) these communications by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the general communication email and setting their preference. We offer opt-out mechanisms in the text of each general communication email we send, and you may also contact us at the email or street address at the top of this page to opt-out. Unless otherwise stated in this policy, Elfster does not share, sell, rent, or trade personally identifiable information with third parties for their promotional purposes.

If your personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if you no longer desire our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate your personally identifiable information. This can be done at Elfster.com or by contacting us via[help@elfster.com](mailto:help@elfster.com).

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law if we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a judicial proceeding, a court order, or a legal process served on our Web site.

## Security

Elfster uses reasonable precautions to keep the personal information disclosed to us secure. This includes the use of fire walls, secure sockets layer encryption, and secure facilities. If an Elfster user knowingly provides personal information, such as a name or email address, in an answer or public wish list item or other public service, message or bulletin board, that user should be aware that the information provided can be collected and used by third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of Elfster.

## For Children Under 18 Years Old

ATTENTION KIDS: No information should be submitted to Elfster by anyone under 18 years of age without their parent's or guardian's consent. Currently, we are not accepted any registrations from Children under 13 years of age.

## Changes and Updates

Elfster reserves the right to make material changes this policy at any time by posting notice of the existence of a new privacy statement. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post a prominent notice on our homepage 30 calendar days prior to implementing the changes so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
