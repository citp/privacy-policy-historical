<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Elvoline is owned and operated by Elvoline S.à r.l.. 44, Avenue John F. Kennedy, L-1855, Luxembourg City, Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Registered Company Number: B186165 ("henceforward Elvoline"). The following Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, disclose, and otherwise process personally identifiable information that we collect about individuals ("Personal Data") in connection with the services available from Elvoline through the web site located at Elvoline ("Site"). By visiting the Site, you are consenting to the collection, use, disclosure and processing of your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy. All data that we collect and process is stored on servers located in Hungary, a country that may not provide an equivalent level of data protection to the laws in your home jurisdiction.</p>
<p>On occasion Elvoline may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the law, our Personal Data collection and use practices, the features of our Site, or advances in technology. If we make revisions that change the way we collect or use your Personal Data, those changes will be indicated in this Privacy Policy and the effective date will be noted at the beginning of this Privacy Policy. Therefore, you should review this Privacy Policy periodically so that you are up to date on our most current policies and practices. Elvoline will also prominently post such material changes prior to implementing the change.</p>
<h2>Information we collect</h2>
<p>We collect the Personal Data that you provide us with while using the Site. Personal Data may include your name, address, phone number, credit card number or e-mail address. We also collect non-personally identifiable information, which may be linked to your Personal Data, including your log-in name, IP address and password, and your search preferences related to specific searches.</p>
<h2>Protecting your personal data</h2>
<p>To prevent unauthorized access, we maintain strict physical, electronic and organizational procedures to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, alteration or unauthorized disclosure or access. Elvoline uses <strong>Secure Socket Layer</strong> technology to protect credit card transactions by encrypting credit card information during transit.</p>
<h2>How we use the information we collect</h2>
<p>We use Personal Data and other information collected through the site to register you with our service and our rewards program, to provide you with the requested products and services, to build features that will make the services available on the Site easier to use and to contact you about these services. This includes faster purchase requests, better customer service and timely notice of new services and special offers. From time to time, Elvoline may contact you to request feedback on your experience using the Site, to assist us with improving the Site or to offer special savings or promotions to you as a Site user, where you have indicated your consent to receiving such communications. If you would prefer not to receive notices of special savings or promotions, you may simply opt-out from receiving them by replying to Elvoline using the hyperlink provided in these notices.</p>
<h2>Sharing your personal data</h2>
<p>Elvoline may share your Personal Data with third parties we employ to perform services on our behalf, such as web hosting services, data analysis, marketing our products and services, handling credit card transactions and to otherwise provide you with customer service. All such third parties will be under an obligation to maintain the security and confidentiality of your Personal Data and to process the Personal Data only in accordance with our instructions.</p>
<p>In some cases, Elvoline may require that you transact directly with a third party to obtain services. When you use the Site to reserve a hotel room or obtain another product or service, we may provide your Personal Data to that hotel or other involved third party.</p>
<p>Elvoline may disclose Personal Data to protect ourselves against liability, to respond to subpoenas, judicial processes, legitimate requests by law enforcement officials, or as otherwise required in order to comply with applicable law, or to the purchasers in connection with any sale, assignment, or other transfer of all or a part of our business or company. We may also disclose Personal Data to enforce or apply the terms and conditions applicable to our products and services, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Elvoline, our users, or others.</p>
<p>In the situations described above, the recipient of the Personal Data may be located in a jurisdiction that may not provide an equivalent level of data protection to the laws in your home jurisdiction.</p>
<h2>Our policy concerning cookies</h2>
<p>To be able to offer you a better, faster service, we use "cookie" technology on our Site. Cookies are small bits of code, usually stored on a user's computer hard drive, which enable a web site to "personalize" itself for each user by remembering information about the user's visit to the web site. Cookies can store a variety of information, including IP addresses, navigational data, server information, data transfer times, user preferences, and e-mail addresses and passwords needed to access the Site. The "Help" section of the toolbar on most Internet browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies or how to configure your browser to reject cookies altogether. If you disable cookies, you might not be able to access important functions or features of the Site and your use of the Site may be limited. The cookies used on this Site are associated with a user's Personal Data.</p>
<h2>How you can access or change your personally-identifying information</h2>
<p>If you wish to update any Personal Data you provided previously, or to exercise any right of access, rectification, deletion, or opposition to the processing of your Personal Data that you may have under applicable law, please contact us. To protect your privacy and security, we will verify your identity before granting access or making changes to your Personal Data.
