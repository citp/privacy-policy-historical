The only information which may be disclosed in print form or online without prior notice of your consent is directory information which is defined as name, address, dates of attendance, major, degrees, awards, honors, and weight and height of athletes. For complete information, see the [Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act](https://web.archive.org/students.aspx?id=918 "Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act").
