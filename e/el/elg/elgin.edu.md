ECC is committed to complying with the following acts along with all other applicable federal and state laws:

  1. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which generally prohibits the release of student education records without student permission. The only information which may be disclosed in print form or online without prior notice of your consent is directory information which is defined as name, address, dates of attendance, major, degrees, awards, honors, and weight and height of athletes. For complete information, see the [Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act](https://web.archive.org/students.aspx?id=918 "Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act").
