 DATA PRIVACY & PROTECTION POLICY
 POLICY
 This Data Privacy & Protection Policy applies to ELMO Software Limited’s Cloud HR & Payroll applications and platform
 (collectively, the “Services”), elmosoftware.com.au and other ELMO websites (collectively, the “Websites”) and other
 interactions (e.g., customer service inquiries, user conferences, etc.) you may have with ELMO Software Limited and its
 subsidiaries.
 This Data Privacy & Protection Policy does not apply to any third party applications or software that integrate with the
 Services through the ELMO Software Limited platform (“Third Party Services”), or any other third party products, services
 or businesses. In addition, a separate agreement governs delivery, access and use of the Services (the “Software as a
 Service Agreement”), including the processing of any messages, files or other content submitted through Services
 accounts (collectively, “Customer Data”).
 The organisation (e.g., your employer or another entity or person) that entered into the Software as a Service Agreement
 (“Customer”) controls their instance of the Services and any associated Customer Data. If you have any questions about
 specific settings and privacy practices, please contact the Customer who has provided you with access to the ELMO
 INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND RECEIVE
 ELMO Software may collect and receive Customer Data and other information and data (“Other Information”) in a variety
 of ways:
          Customer Data. Customers or individuals granted access to ELMO Cloud HR and Payroll software services
           (“Services”) by a Customer (“Authorised User”) routinely submit Customer Data to ELMO Software Limited when
           using the Services.
          Other Information. ELMO Software Limited also collects, generates and/or receives Other Information:
               I.    Usage Information.
                            Services Metadata. When an Authorised User interacts with the Services, metadata is
                                generated that provides additional context about the way Authorised Users work. For example,
                                ELMO Software logs the features, content and links you interact with, and activity logs for all
                                actions (e.g. assignment, modification, edit, copy, delete) taken by Authorised users when
                                interacting with the Services
                            Log data. As with most websites and technology services delivered over the Internet, our
                                servers automatically collect information when you access or use our Websites or Services and
                                record it in log files. This log data may include the Internet Protocol (IP) address, the address of
                                the web page visited before using the Website or Services, browser type and settings, the date
                                and time the Services were used, information about browser configuration and plugins,
                                language preferences and cookie data.
                            Device information. ELMO Software Limited collects information about devices accessing the
                                Services, including type of device, what operating system is used, device settings, application
                                IDs, unique device identifiers and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this Other
                                Information often depends on the type of device used and its settings.
                            Location information. We receive information from you, your Customer and other third-parties
                                that helps us approximate your location. We may, for example, use a business address
                                submitted by your employer, or an IP address received from your browser or device to
                                determine approximate location.
              II.    Cookie Information. ELMO Software Limited uses cookies and similar technologies in our Websites and
                     Services that help us collect Other Information. The Websites and Services may also include cookies and
                     similar tracking technologies of third parties, which may collect Other Information about you via the
                     Websites and Services and across other websites and online services.
             III.    Third Party Data. ELMO Software Limited may receive data about organisations, industries, Website
                     visitors, marketing campaigns and other matters related to our business from parent corporation(s),
                     affiliates and subsidiaries, our partners or others that we use to make our own information better or
                     more useful. This data may be combined with Other Information we collect and might include aggregate
                     level data, such as which IP addresses correspond to zip codes or countries. Or it might be more specific:
                     for example, how well an online marketing or email campaign performed.

             IV.     Additional Information Provided to ELMO Software Limited. We receive Other Information when
                     submitted to our Websites or if you participate in a focus group, contest, activity or event, apply for a
                     job, request support, interact with our social media accounts or otherwise communicate with ELMO
                     Software Limited.
 Generally, no one is under a statutory or contractual obligation to provide any Customer Data or Other Information
 (collectively, “Information”). However, certain Information is collected automatically and, if some Information, such as
 basic user profile level information (e.g. name, email address), is not provided, we may be unable to provide the Services.
 HOW WE USE INFORMATION
 Customer Data will be used by ELMO Software Limited in accordance with Customer’s instructions, including any
 applicable terms in the Software as a Service Agreement and Customer’s use of Services functionality, and as required by
 applicable law. ELMO Software Limited is a processor of Customer Data and Customer is the controller. Customer may, for
 example, use the Services to grant and remove access to the application, assign roles and configure settings, access,
 modify, export, share and remove Customer Data and otherwise apply its policies to the Services.
 ELMO Software Limited uses Other Information in furtherance of our legitimate interests in operating our Services,
 Websites and business. More specifically, ELMO Software Limited uses Other Information:
          To provide, update, maintain and protect our Services, Websites and business. This includes use of Other
           Information to support delivery of the Services under a Software as a Service Agreement, prevent or address
           service errors, security or technical issues, analyse and monitor usage, trends and other activities or at an
           Authorised User’s request.
          As required by applicable law, legal process or regulation.
          To communicate with you by responding to your requests, comments and questions. If you contact us, we may use
           your Other Information to respond.
          To develop and provide additional features and improvements to functionality. ELMO Software Limited tries to
           make the Services as useful as possible for our Customers and their Authorised Users. For example, we may
           improve search functionality by using Other Information to help determine and rank the relevance of content,
           channels or expertise to an Authorised User, make Services suggestions based on historical use and predictive
           models, identify organisational trends and insights, to customise a Services experience or create new features or
           improvements or develop new products.
          To send emails and other communications. We may send you service, technical and other administrative emails,
           messages and other types of communications. We may also contact you to inform you about changes in our
           Services, our Services offerings, and important Services-related notices, such as security and fraud notices. These
           communications are considered part of the Services and you may not opt out of them. In addition, we sometimes
           send emails about new product features, promotional communications or other news about ELMO Software
           Limited. These are marketing messages so you can control whether you receive them.
          For billing, account management and other administrative matters. ELMO Software Limited may need to contact
           you for invoicing, account management and similar reasons and we use account data to administer accounts and
           keep track of billing and payments.
          To investigate and help prevent security issues and abuse.
 If Information is aggregated or de-identified so it is no longer reasonably associated with an identified or identifiable
 natural person, ELMO Software Limited may use it for any business purpose. To the extent Information is associated with
 an identified or identifiable natural person and is protected as personal data under applicable data protection law, it is
 referred to in this Data Privacy & Protection Policy as “Personal Data.”

 they or any other third parties choose to share or disclose Information.

          Customer Access. Owners, administrators, Authorised Users and other Customer representatives and personnel
           may be able to access, modify or restrict access to Other Information. This may include, for example, an
           Authorised User’s email address which could be made visible to other Authorised Users within the Customer, or
           restricted to specific roles (e.g. manager or company admin) or security profiles.
          Third Party Service Providers and Partners. We may engage third party companies or individuals as service
           providers or business partners to process Other Information and support our business. These third parties may,
           for example, provide virtual computing and storage services. Additional information about the subprocessors we
           use to support delivery of our Services is set forth within the section “Subprocessors”.

          Aggregated or De-identified Data. We may disclose or use aggregated or de-identified Other Information for any

           for business or research purposes, or as part of new product offerings or features provided to Customers which
           provide anonymised benchmark metrics for comparative performance between Customers.
          To Comply with Laws. If we receive a request for information, we may disclose Other Information if we
           reasonably believe disclosure is in accordance with or required by any applicable law, regulation or legal process.
           This may include the Notifiable Data Breaches (NDB) scheme contained within the Australian Privacy Act, and
           data breach notification provisions contained within the European Economic Area General Data Protection
           Regulation (GDPR). For example, where Personal or Sensitive Information is lost or subject to unauthorised
           access or disclosure and will likely result in serious harm to an individual / risk to the rights and freedoms of
           natural persons, ELMO Software Limited will take appropriate response action in accordance with applicable law.
