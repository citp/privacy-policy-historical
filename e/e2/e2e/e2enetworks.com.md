Our personal information handling practices are described below, in any applicable privacy supplements, and in notices at the point of data collection.

We urge you to read this Privacy Statement so that you understand our commitment to you and your privacy, and how you can participate in that commitment. If you have any questions, please contact us at

#### SCOPE and YOUR CONSENT TO OUR USE OF YOUR INFORMATION

This Privacy Statement applies to personal information and other information collected by E2E or its service providers from or about: (i) visitors to, or users of, its websites (“E2E Websites”); (ii) prospective and current customers using E2E hosting and information technology services (the “Services”); (iii) service providers and business partners; (iv) job applicants; and (v) other third-parties that it interacts with.

By providing your personal information to E2E in the ways described in this Privacy Statement, you:

  * agree that you are authorized to provide that information;
  * are accepting this Privacy Statement and any supplementary privacy statement that may be relevant to you.



If you do not agree to our practices, please do not register, subscribe, create an account, or otherwise interact with our Services or E2E Websites.

#### 1\. WHAT INFORMATION DOES E2E COLLECT AND FOR WHAT PURPOSE IS IT USED?

When we refer to “Personal Information”, we mean any information that can identify you. It includes information or an opinion from which you are reasonably identifiable. In some jurisdictions, Personal Information includes information that identifies a legal entity, such as company name. We describe the Personal Information that we collect in more detail below.

We may also collect information that is related to you but that does not personally identify you (“Non-personal Information”). Non-personal Information also includes information that could personally identify you in its original form, but that we have modified (for instance, by aggregating, anonymizing or de-identifying such information) in order to remove or hide any Personal Information.

#### WHEN WE COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT YOU

  * **Information you give us or our service providers.** You may provide Personal Information when you: (i) access E2E Websites, (ii) request, purchase and use the Services, (iii) communicate with E2E via phone calls, chat, email, web forms, social media and other methods of communication, (iv) subscribe to E2E marketing material, (v) apply for a job, or (vi) provide services to E2E.
  * **Information we collect about you and your device via automated means.** Each time you visit an E2E Website, view an E2E advertisement on a third party-owned website or read an E2E marketing email, we may automatically collect information about you via cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies. 
    * **Email communication.** We use pixel tags and cookies in our marketing emails so that we can track your interaction with those messages, such as when you open the email or click a URL link that’s embedded within them. When recipients click on one of those URLs, they pass through a  
separate web server before arriving at the destination page on an E2E Website. We use tools like pixel tags and cookies so that we can determine interest in particular topics and measure and improve the effectiveness of our communications.
  * **Information we receive from other sources.** We work closely with third parties (for example, business partners, service providers, sub-contractors, advertising networks, analytics providers, search information providers, credit reference agencies, fraud protection services, channel partners and resellers) and may receive information about you from them. 
    * **Social Media Platforms.** We may receive certain information that’s stored or processed by third parties, such as the social media sites Facebook®, Twitter® and LinkedIn® when you interact with us through these social media platforms. E2E Websites may include social media features – such as the Facebook “Like” button – and widgets – such as the “share this” button. These features may collect your IP address as well as details of the pages you are visiting on E2E Websites. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or  
hosted by E2E Websites. Each social media platform may have a privacy statement that specifically governs its use of social media features.
    * **Public Forums, Blogs and the Customer Reference Program.** E2E Websites may feature bulletin boards, blogs or forums. Any Personal Information that you choose to submit via such a forum may be read, collected, or used by others who visit these forums, and may be used to send you unsolicited messages. E2E posts a list of customers and testimonials on E2E Websites. These lists and testimonials usually contain Personal Information such as customer names and job titles. E2E obtains the consent of each customer prior to posting any information on such a list or posting testimonials.
    * **Co-branding.** Some E2E Websites or Services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company. If you use such website or Services, both E2E and the other company may receive the Personal Information that’s collected via that co-branded website or Service. The company whose privacy statement is displayed on a co-branded website will be responsible for Personal Information collected on such a website.
    * **Third-party vendors.** In order to provide the Services and improve E2E Websites, E2E may engage the services of third-party vendors. In the process of supplying services to E2E, these third-party vendors may need to collect Personal Information about you. 



#### THE TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT

  * **Contact Information** includes your name, company name, job title, telephone numbers, fax numbers, postal addresses, email addresses, or other addresses at which you receive communications from or on behalf of E2E (“Contact Information”). When you are expressing an interest in obtaining additional information about the Services or signing up to use the Services, E2E requires that you provide contact information (“Required Contact Information”).

Such information includes standard information from your web browser (such as browser type and browser language), your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, and your activities on E2E Websites (such as the web pages viewed and the links clicked, number of visits, access time, device ID or other unique identifier, domain name, screen views, language information, device name and model, and operating system type), the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave E2E Websites, your computer operating system, and mobile device operating system (if you are accessing E2E Websites using a mobile device).

While E2E does not monitor or view the specific data stored by its customers who are using the Services, it is necessary for E2E to track various parameters of transferred data (file size, etc.) to support features including, but not limited to, bandwidth monitoring and storage usage. E2E treats such information as Non-personal Information and in accordance with its agreements it has in place with its customers.
