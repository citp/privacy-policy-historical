## How your personal information is used by e2save.com

When you place an order with e2save.com, we need to collect certain information to be able to process your order. What we need varies depending on the items you have ordered, and the pages you are asked to complete will vary accordingly. The information is sent to us via an SSL encrypted server. This information will form part of a permanent record of your dealings with e2save.com. 

When you email us, we may ask for certain information to be able to check this record and answer your questions quickly and accurately. When you contact us, in any way, we may make a note of this contact if it is relevant to your permanent record. This allows us to provide a higher level of ongoing customer care. 

We will keep your personal details, given to us by you or others during your relationship with us and other companies in the Carphone Warehouse Group plc group of companies.   
**  
These include:**

  * details you give us on application forms or during conversations with you on the telephone or at any of our stores,

You agree that we may use your personal information to make a credit check on you before we provide you with any services. These searches will be recorded by the credit reference agencies. We may disclose information about how you run your accounts to the credit reference agencies. We and other organisations may also use credit reference agency and fraud prevention agency records that we receive about you, people financially linked to you and others in your household to help make decisions about you and them. 

We may also use your information for research and statistical analysis with the aim of improving our services. 

When assessing an application, we may use automated decision-making systems.

  * in order to obtain professional advice,
  * we or others need to investigate or prevent crime (e.g. to fraud prevention agencies),
  * the law permits or requires it, or any regulatory or governmental body requests or requires it, even without your consent, or,
  * there is a duty to the public to reveal the information.



We may administer your account and provide other services from centres in countries outside Europe that do not always have the same standard of data protection laws as the UK. However, we will have a contract in place to ensure that your information is adequately protected, and we will remain bound by our obligations under the Data Protection Act even when your personal information is processed outside Europe.
