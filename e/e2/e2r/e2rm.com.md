## Artez Interactive Privacy Policy

 _Last updated November 25th, 2009_

### General Privacy Statement

ARTEZ INTERACTIVE INC. respects your right to privacy and is committed to protect the personal information you provide to us. Your personal information will only be used for the purpose we have identified when obtaining the information. ARTEZ INTERACTIVE uses the information collected through its Internet-based tools to facilitate the processing of donations, to provide tax receipts, and processing online event registrations. ARTEZ INTERACTIVE does not trade or sell your personal information.

#### I. Introduction

ARTEZ INTERACTIVE is committed to protecting and safeguarding the privacy and security of the personal information provided to us by our clients' donors, volunteers, constituents and others. Our policy complies with the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (Canada) (PIPEDA) and the 10 basic principles set out in the Canadian Standards Association Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information. By becoming a member, requesting information, or registering for events on websites we empower, an individual is giving ARTEZ INTERACTIVE permission to contact him or her by way of the information provided. During the course of servicing the needs of registrants, donors, constituents and others we may gather personal information. This policy explains why we may need your personal information, how the confidentiality of this information is protected, and how you can find out what information concerning you is recorded.

#### II. Personal Information

Personal information is defined as any information that can be used to distinguish, identify or contact a specific individual that pertains to the use of Internet-based tools to facilitate the processing of donations and registrations online and credit card information. Personal information does not include business contact information (with the exception of email addresses which are considered personal information) and certain publicly available information, such as names, addresses and telephone numbers as published in telephone directories (i.e. information on a business card). Most of the information ARTEZ INTERACTIVE collects is not personal information. Where an individual uses his or her home contact information as business contact information as well, ARTEZ INTERACTIVE considers that the contact information provided is business contact information and is therefore not subject to protection as personal information.
