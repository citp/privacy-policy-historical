### Security

No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, FrontStream cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure security on our systems. We use secure server software (SSL) and firewalls to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software. Daily review of system and activity logs are another mechanism used to protect your information. These logs are reviewed regularly, any anomalies or discrepancies are investigated thoroughly, and action is taken immediately. To further protect you, a timeout feature is often used. This feature will automatically log you out of your current merchant service session after an extended period of inactivity on the payment gateway site. If FrontStream learns of a security systems breach, we will notify you so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. By using this web site or providing personal information to us, you agree that FrontStream can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues relating to your use of this site.
