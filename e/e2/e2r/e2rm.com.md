In this Privacy Policy, “you” or “your” refers to a user of our Services who may use the Services directly through us or through one of our corporate customers (e.g., a nonprofit organization or other corporate entity) (“Customer”). For example, a you may be an individual seeking information from a Customer or you may be providing a donation to a Customer, and you use our platform or otherwise access the Services that we provide to the Customer. Please note that this Privacy Policy only covers the data we collect, and it does not apply to websites or services we do not control, including websites or services of our Customers.

In the use of Services, you may also choose to disclose or provide your communication preferences, your physical location, and your demographic information (e.g., your age, marital status, ethnicity/race, and gender). All of this is “Personal Information,” because it can be used to identify you.
