The following terms apply, in addition to the privacy policy described above:

  * COMPELLED DISCLOSURE: Episerver may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
  * DISPUTE RESOLUTION: Any questions or concerns regarding the use or disclosure of Personal Data should be directed to the notices address specified in Contact Information below. Episerver will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of Personal Data in accordance with the principles contained in this Policy. For complaints that cannot be resolved between Episerver and the complainant, Episerver has agreed to participate in the dispute resolution procedures of the panel established by the European data protection authorities to resolve disputes pursuant to the Privacy Shield Principles. Under certain conditions, as more fully described on the Privacy Shield website https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How‐to‐Submit‐a‐Complaint, individuals may be able to invoke binding arbitration before the Privacy Shield Panel jointly created by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission. 
  * YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS: California’s “Shine the Light” law permits customers in California to request certain details about how certain types of their information are shared with third parties and, in some cases, affiliates, for those third parties’ and affiliates. Under the law, a business should either provide California customers certain information upon request or permit California customers to opt in to, or opt out of, this type of sharing.
  * Episerver may share Personal Data as defined by California’s “Shine the Light” law with third parties and/or affiliates for such third parties’ and affiliates. If you are a California resident and wish to obtain information about our compliance with this law, please e‐mail or write to us at the addresses specified in “Contact Information” below. Requests must include “California Privacy Rights Request” in the first line of the description and include your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code. Please note that Episerver is not required to respond to requests made by means other than through the provided e‐mail address or mail address.
  * ENFORCEMENT AND COMPLIANCE: Episerver will conduct compliance audits of its relevant privacy practices to verify adherence to this Policy. Any employee that Episerver determines is in violation of this policy will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. Episerver will respond promptly to inquiries and requests by the Department of Commerce for information relating to the Privacy Shield and/or to complaints regarding compliance with the Principles referred by EU Member State authorities through the Department. Episerver is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission with respect to its compliance with the EU‐U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. If Episerver becomes subject to an FTC or court order based on non‐compliance, Episerver will make public any relevant Privacy Shield‐related sections of any compliance or assessment report submitted to the FTC, to the extent consistent with confidentiality requirements. Episerver may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requests.
  * ONWARD TRANSFER: If a third‐party processes Personal Data on behalf of Episerver in a manner inconsistent with the General Data Protection Regulation and applicable law, Episerver could be liable unless Episerver can prove that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to any damage.  If Episerver transfers data to a third party agent, Episerver will: (i) transfer such data only for limited and specified purposes; (ii) ascertain that the agent is obligated to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Principles; (iii) take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that the agent effectively processes the Personal Data transferred in a manner consistent with Episerver’s obligations under the Principles; (iv) require the agent to notify Episerver if it makes a determination that it can no longer meet its obligation to provide the same level of protection as is required by the Principles; (v) upon notice, including under (iv), take reasonable and appropriate steps to stop and remediate unauthorized processing; and (vi) provide a summary or a representative copy of the relevant privacy provisions of its contract with that agent to the Department of Commerce upon request.
