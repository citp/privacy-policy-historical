## Ekomi and your privacy

At Ekomi we respect your right to privacy and we understand that, as a visitor to ekomi.com, you prefer to control your own personal information and preferences. For this reason, we may ask you to register or to provide personal information and preferences when you visit certain areas of ekomi.com, download software, or request information. 

We will guard the personal information you share with us to ensure the content, services, and advertising that we provide on ekomi.com are always tailored to your current, designated preferences.

When you provide Ekomi with your name (or alias), e-mail address, mailing address, or telephone number, and you do not 'opt out,' Ekomi and Ekomi representatives and affiliates may use the provided information to alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information, classes, new services, and other Ekomi information. Representatives and affiliates may include value-added resellers and authorized training partners. Beyond its representatives and affiliates, Ekomi does not offer or allow the selling of any user-provided information to third parties.

Ekomi respects the rights users give us when opting to receive e-mail communications and enforces internal policies to preserve those rights. It is our objective to retain the long-term ability to continue to communicate with our users.

If you do not want Ekomi or Ekomi representatives to contact you, you may "opt out" of this preference at any time, whether you're online or contacting Ekomi directly. As part of your preference flexibility, you'll always have the option to opt back in and have Ekomi contact you based on your previous or new preferences. For instructions, please see the section "Contact Us," below.

If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you can still visit the Ekomi websites; however, you will not have access to areas that require personal identification.

## Ekomi membership and the use of log files (cookies)

  
Ekomi offers free membership to all who download the ekomi player. In order to establish membership, visitors are requested to provide personal information. This information is stored and protected by your user-established member ID and password.

Ekomi utilizes visitor log files (cookies). Once a user enters our site, a cookie follows them through their click stream path. Examples of information being collected by these cookies and the hosted tracking include the number of times a user came to our site(s), and the paths they took to get there. Ekomi uses the data collected from website visitor cookies and hosted tracking in aggregate form only and does not collect any personally identifiable information. Use of this information helps us better understand what users are seeking and learning at our website(s) and helps us identify potential navigation issues.

## How Ekomi will protect your personal information

Ekomi will always protect the personal information that you share with us. Ekomi stores information internally in a controlled, secure environment. If, for example, you make a purchase online, we route all transactions through SSL (Secure Socket Layers) and will process your credit card number only to secure your current payment. The SSL transaction does not retain your credit card number subsequent to the transaction at hand and will not use the number for marketing purposes.

We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering customer questions about products or services, sending postal mail and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

If Ekomi requests general demographic information, this information is limited to reporting purposes only; members remain anonymous. Phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and postal addresses are not shared for demographic reports with outside entities. Ekomi may occasionally present a special contest or promotion that is sponsored by another company. To qualify for entry, we may ask you to provide personal information. If we plan to share that information with the sponsor(s), we will provide an up-front statement to that effect.

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our website.
