 **2\. Data collection and processing through assumed name creation**

After registering on our website, we collect and save the above mentioned data in an assumed name form. This data is connected to an internal code but is renamed, with the assumed name having no connection or link with the actual name or other personal characteristics.

For the purpose of tailor-made advertising and marketing campaigns improving the service we offer our customers, all profiles are compiled based on actual data collection but only using assumed names.

You may object to the compilation of a utilization profile. The full details of your rights of objection can be found under the paragraph “Right of Withdrawal & Right of Objection.”

We guarantee that no personal details and data of any kind are passed to any third parties but will be exclusively used for internal purposes in the assumed name format.

In case that eKomi is providing the service of sending the review invitation e-mail, the necessary personal information will be transmitted and used only for this exact purpose. After the legal retention period this data will be deleted.

The Company is responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable data protection laws. In addition, the Company alone is responsible

  * for the manner in which End Users are approached and informed about the possibility of leaving Ratings & Reviews;
  * to assess the legal permissibility of the advertisement (including its manner) of the products and/or services of the Company, in particular under competition and advertisement laws; and
