You acknowledge that the use and storage of your financial information is governed by the Payment Processor’s applicable terms of service and privacy policy. 

#### PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED AUTOMATICALLY:

  * We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Website or use our services. Company automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, which may include your IP address, cookie information, web browser, device type, the dates and times you viewed pages, and the page you requested. 
  * Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Website and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. Company only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Website or services so that we can make the Website appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our Website or services. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use the Website or services, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Company may also use this usage information to deliver customized third party advertisements and information and to track your entries, submissions, and the status of any promotions or other activities. Again, Company never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally. 
  * We may also obtain information, including Personal Information, from third parties and sources other than the Website, such as advertisers, or other users who import your email address to their address book. We may also, at your discretion, receive information from third party services that provide a mechanism to expose information you have provided to such third party through use of an application program interface (API), such as Facebook Connect. If we combine or associate information from other sources with Personal Information that we collect through the Website, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 



#### E-MAIL COMMUNICATIONS:

We may use your email address to contact you for administrative purposes, customer services purposes, promotional purposes, to address intellectual property infringement, rights of privacy, or defamation issues. We often receive a confirmation when you open an email from Company if your computer supports this type of program. Company uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful. When you receive e-mail from Company, you can opt out of receiving further e-mails by following the included instructions to unsubscribe.
