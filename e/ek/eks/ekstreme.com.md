# eKstreme.com's Privacy Policy - eKstreme.com

Although eKstreme.com is a personal site, I do collect some information about the visitors. This page describes what exactly gets collected, why, and how it is stored. I am not a lawyer, so I will not give you a legal document, but will give you a simple explanation.

## Browsing Pattern Information

eKstreme.com uses an internal version of [PHPCounter](https://web.archive.org/phpcounter/) to keep counts on the number of visitors I get.

This information is aggregated into large log files and analysed in one go. I honestly do not care about personal information as it's not useful to optimize the site.

## Personal Information Submitted to eKstreme.com

eKstreme.com contains a guestbook, a feedback form, comments on each page, and can contain other means of directly submitting to me personal information. I do NOT share/sell/lease this information with/to third parties. I hate spam very much too!

### Support and Feedback Form

Most feedback I get relates to support of the scripts and tools. Once the problem is sorted, most emails get deleted. I respect everyone's privacy deeply.

### Guestbook

The guestbook is also a means of people to add to the contents of eKstreme.com that is beyond my control. I keep an eye on the submissions and delete any posts that are not appropriate.

## Copyright

Unless otherwise stated, all contents on eKstreme.com, including text and images are my creation, and are copyrighted. Due credit is given to creations I know that are not mine.

## Contact

If you have any questions, you can contact me using the [contact form](https://web.archive.org/contact.php).
