We have put in place reasonably adequate safeguards to protect information that we have collected about you. We limit access to personal information about you to employees whom we reasonably believe need to have access to in order to do their jobs.

We do not rent, sell or share personal information about you with third parties, save for affiliated companies and trusted business partners. However, we reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to eGuide services and products, announcements, promotions, contests or newsletters. If you do not wish to receive such offers or mailings, you can easily choose to unsubscribe from the received publications.

In the event that we do share such collected information in accordance with this Privacy Statement, the disclosure will be limited to only aggregated information which will not identify you.
