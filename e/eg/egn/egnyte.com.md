Thank you for visiting Egnyte Inc.'s website located at www.Egnyte.com. Egnyte Inc. (hereinafter "Egnyte") is concerned about personal privacy and is committed to protecting the privacy of visitors to our website. This Privacy Policy identifies the personally identifiable information that Egnyte collects about you at our website and describes how Egnyte uses and protects such information.

**YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITE OR THE SERVICES OFFERED BY EGNYTE ON THE WEBSITE IS CONDITIONED UPON YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS OF SERVICE LOCATED AT HTTP://WWW.EGNYTE.COM AS WELL AS THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THE TERMS OF SERVICE OR TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, DO NOT USE THE WEBSITE OR SERVICES OFFERED BY EGNYTE.**

**What Information Is Collected**  
You may visit our website and learn about Egnyte's service offered on the website anonymously. The data that we regularly collect about visitors to our website (e.g., browser type, pages accessed, duration of visit, etc.) does not enable us to identify you. We also collect your IP address, but this information generally does not reveal your personal identity.

We collect personally identifiable information about you only if you voluntarily provide it to us when you use an online registration form to create an account for use of the Egnyte service. You are required to pick a password and username, and to provide your first, last name and email address and some additional contact information about your company/establishment. We may also ask you, but you are not required to provide, information regarding how you learned about Egnyte. Finally, if you use the Egnyte service, we will store the data you upload onto our servers. Egnyte may access your account, including its data, to respond to service or technical problems or as stated in this Agreement. You, not Egnyte, shall have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, integrity, legality, reliability, appropriateness and copyright of all data stored in your account. Furthermore, Egnyte shall not be responsible or liable for the deletion, correction, destruction, damage, loss or failure to store any data.

**Use of Information**  
We use your contact information and unique identifier (such as a user name and password) to provide access to the Egnyte service available on our website and to contact you when reasonably necessary. We may also use any information you have provided as reasonably necessary to administer or provide customer support for the website and the Egnyte service. We use the information submitted by you to send you correspondence and other information that may interest you and to respond to your correspondence. If, for any reason, you would like to be removed from our email list, you can send us an email at [inquiry@egnyte.com](mailto:inquiry@egnyte.com).

**Disclosure of Information**  
We do not sell, rent or lease your personally identifiable information to third parties. We may disclose your personally identifiable information to certain third party vendors (e.g., data storage facilities) used by Egnyte to assist us in providing the Egnyte services, to the extent necessary to enable such vendors to provide such assistance.

  1. We may send email offers to selected groups of Egnyte users on behalf of our company and on behalf of other businesses in whose products and services you may have an interest; but we will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information to any such businesses. We will also include in each such email instructions as to how you can permanently opt-out of receiving any such future emails.
  2. We also reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information if we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law, regulation or other government authority.
  3. Finally, we may disclose your personally identifiable information upon a transfer or sale to another entity of all or substantially all of Egnyte's assets or stock in Egnyte's line of business to which this privacy policy relates or upon any other corporate reorganization. (If, for example, in the future, we undergo any sort of corporate reorganization, we may need to transfer your personally identifiable information to the surviving entity.)

**A Special Note about Children**  
Our website does not gather any personally identifiable information from children that we know are under the age of 13. We believe strongly that parents should play an integral part in their child's on-line experience and should monitor that activity to ensure on-line sites are respecting their child's privacy.
