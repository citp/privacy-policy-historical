        <p>YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITE OR THE SERVICES OFFERED BY EGNYTE ON THE WEBSITE IS CONDITIONED UPON YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS OF SERVICE LOCATED AT <a href="http://www.egnyte.com">http://www.egnyte.com</a> AS WELL AS THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THE TERMS OF SERVICE OR TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, DO NOT USE THE WEBSITE OR SERVICES OFFERED BY EGNYTE.</p>
        <p> <strong>What Information Is Collected</strong><br>
          You may visit our website and learn about Egnyte's service offered on the website anonymously.</p>
        <p>We collect personally identifiable information about you only if you voluntarily provide it to us when you use an online registration form to create an account for use of the Egnyte service or to submit a reseller inquiry. You are required to pick a password and username, and to provide your first name, last name and email address and some additional contact information about your company/establishment. We may also ask you, but you are not required to provide, information regarding how you learned about Egnyte.</p>
        <p>If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form.  You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date).  We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders.  If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.</p>
        <p> <b>Use of Information</b><br>
          We use your contact information and unique identifier (such as a user name and password) to provide access to the Egnyte service available on our website and to contact you when reasonably necessary. We may also use any information you have provided as reasonably necessary to administer or provide customer support for the website and the Egnyte service. We use the information submitted by you to send you correspondence and other information that may interest you and to respond to your correspondence. If, for any reason, you would like to be removed from our email list, you can send us an email at <a href="mailto:inquiry@egnyte.com">inquiry@egnyte.com</a>.</p>
        <p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password.  We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, to manage your account, and to help us improve our customer support and service to you overall.  We will communicate with you by email or telephone, in accordance with your wishes.  We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.  For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email.  Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.  If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.  If you wish to subscribe to our monthly newsletter, we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you.  Our newsletters contain important information such as updates and enhancements to our services.  Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe.</p>
        <p>Finally, if you use the Egnyte service, we will store the data you upload onto our servers.  Egnyte may access your account, including its data, to respond to service or technical problems or as stated in this Agreement.  You, as a Power User with administrator capabilities, may manage the Address Book that includes inputting other Power Users' and Standard Users' first names, last names, and email addresses.  You, as a regular Power User, may manage the Address Book that includes inputting Standard Users' first names, last names, and email addresses.  Email communications resulting from the management of the Address Book is limited to the initial setup of Power User and Standard User accounts. You, not Egnyte, shall have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, integrity, legality, reliability, appropriateness and copyright of all data stored in your account.  Furthermore, Egnyte shall not be responsible or liable for the deletion, correction, destruction, damage, loss or failure to store any data.</p>
        <p> <b>Disclosure of Information</b><br>
          We do not share, sell, rent or lease your personally identifiable information to third parties for their promotional purposes. We may disclose your personally identifiable information to certain third party vendors (e.g., data storage facilities, payment processors, email service providers) used by Egnyte to assist us in providing the Egnyte services, to the extent necessary to enable such vendors to provide such assistance.  These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purposes.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>We may send email offers to selected groups of Egnyte users' on behalf of our company and on behalf of other businesses in whose products and services you may have an interest; but we will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information to any such businesses. We will also include in each such email instructions as to how you can permanently opt-out of receiving any such future emails.</li>
          <li>We also reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information if we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law, regulation or other government authority and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our website.</li>
          <li>Finally, we may disclose your personally identifiable information upon a transfer or sale to another entity of all or substantially all of Egnyte's assets or stock in Egnyte's line of business to which this privacy policy relates or upon any other corporate reorganization. (If, for example, in the future, we undergo any sort of corporate reorganization, we may need to transfer your personally identifiable information to the surviving entity.)</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p> <b>Updating Your Information</b><br>

        <p> <b>Blog/Testimonials</b><br>
          If you use a blog or testimonial on this site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users' of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.

        <p> <b>A Special Note about Children</b><br>
        </p>
        <p>Our website does not gather any personally identifiable information from children that we know are under the age of 13. We believe strongly that parents should play an integral part in their child's on-line experience and should monitor that activity to ensure on-line sites are respecting their child's privacy. For additional information on protecting children's privacy, visit: <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/tech/tec08.shtm" target="_blank">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/tech/tec08.shtm</a>.</p>
        <p> <b>Log Files</b><br>
          As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.</p>
        <p>We use this information, which does not identify individual users', to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.  We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.</p>
        <p>We use a third-party tracking service called Google Analytics that uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate.  Information tracked includes the search engine used by a visitor, keyword input by a visitor, and search campaign associated with a visitor. The information is captured for marketing and customer segmentation purposes.</p>
        <p><b>Cookies</b><br>
          Cookies are files that your web browser places on your computer's hard drive and are used to tell us whether you have visited our website previously. We issue a session cookie only to record encrypted authentication information for the duration of a specific session and to make it easier for you to navigate our site. The session cookie includes the username of the user and is not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>
        <p><b>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</b><br>
          We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.  This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.  If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please follow the unsubscribe instructions in the emails.</p>
        <p><b>Links to Third Party Websites</b><br>
          We may place from time to time links on our website to one or more websites for our affiliates. Some affiliates may collect personally identifiable information when you access their links or when you indicate you would like to participate in a special offer. When you click on a link to a third party website from our website, your activity and use on the linked website is governed by that website's policies, not by those of Egnyte. We encourage you to visit their websites and review their privacy and user policies.  This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this website.</p>
        <p><b>Security Measures</b><br>
          The security of your personal information is important to us.  When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).  Our website employs procedural and technological measures, consistent with legal requirements and the demands of customer service, reasonably designed to protect your personally identifiable information &amp; your data from loss, misuse or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction, including using secure servers for data storage.</p>
        <p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
        <p><b>Policy Changes</b><br>
          Due to the Internet's rapidly evolving nature, Egnyte may need to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If so, Egnyte will post its updated policy on this system. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently.  If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.</p>
        <p><b>Questions</b><br>
