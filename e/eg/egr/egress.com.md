CRM Information, System Data  
  
We may use information that we hold about you (or if you’re a business, your users) to send information about our and our group companies’ products and services. This may be by email or other electronic means available to us in the future. We may use other information available to us in order to tailor our communications. If you’re an individual in most circumstances we’ll only do this if we have your consent but there may be some situations where we have a legitimate interest in doing so (e.g. where you complete a purchase through our online ecommerce platform).

If you’ve given your consent, you can withdraw this at any time, or if we’re reliant on our legitimate interests for sending you marketing you can object. In either case, just let us know using the details at [www.egress.com/legal/your-rights](https://web.archive.org/legal/your-rights).

#### Free user account information

If you have a free user account with us and the domain of the email address associated with it is owned or controlled by an organisation (like your employer) then:

  * we may share details of the email address associated with your account with that organisation (either as a result of a request we receive or as part of discussions with it relating to a potential purchase)
  * if that organisation subsequently establishes a relationship with us and wishes to add your account to its own business account, then we’ll transfer your account into its business account and certain information concerning your free user account and your past use of it may become accessible to that organisation and its administrator



#### If you provide us with information about others

If you or your business provide information to us about another person, or if you or your business send their information or Content using our services, you must make sure you have the right and permission to do so. We’re reliant on this in order to receive and process the information you or your business provide. By providing it, you confirm that you do.

Where you use Risk-based Protection, or where you correspond with an individual or business that does so, your emails and their associated metadata may be routinely monitored to protect against the risk of misaddressed emails and to improve the accuracy of those decisions. This may include the processing of certain Smart Data about you (e.g. domain characteristics, the strength of your association with the sender) by our Smart Authentication service following your receipt of a secure email to determine the level of access that you may be able to have to that Content without registering for an account with us.

#### Who we may share your information with, and sending information outside the country you’re located in

Details of the sub-contractors used in the provision of our services can be found through the sub-contractor page available at [www.egress.com/subcontractors](https://web.archive.org/subcontractors). We share your information with these third-parties to help with our business activities and delivery of our services.

Where any transfer outside of the country or region that you’re located in (e.g. the European Economic Area (EEA), the United States or the UK) occurs, we’ll ensure that any such transfer or processing is subject to appropriate legal and technical safeguards with our sub-processors in line with local law requirements.

**Content:** Your Content will be stored on secure servers in the UK, the European Economic Area or the United States, depending on your location, onboarding choice and the service(s) that you are subscribing to. You acknowledge that our services are software-as-a-service and so you, your users and recipients may access Content outside the country you’re located in or the Content is hosted in (e.g. by logging into an account anywhere in the world). Where this happens, Content may be processed by you, your user or the recipient on the device used wherever that is located. Where a recipient responds to a secure email that you have sent to them, the Content they create in responding to you will be stored in the jurisdiction that they have selected (which may not be the same as you). In each case, we’ll facilitate this processing for the purpose of performing our contract with you or a relevant recipient or user (where you’re an individual) or for our legitimate interests in providing the requested services to you (where you’re a business).

Your Content may be shared with third parties as directed by you through your use of the features of our services. We may share Content (in encrypted format) with other companies in our group and authorised subprocessors where they provide part of the services that you have purchased from us.

If you are a free user or subscribe to our services online, your Content will be stored on secure servers in the UK and/or the European Economic Area.

**Transfer of Rights:** We reserve the right to transfer our obligations, rights and permissions in CRM Information, System Data, Smart Data and Content to any organisation to which we may transfer our business or assets (including if we, or a relevant part of us or our assets, are proposed to be purchased or acquired by a third party).

**Selling your information:** We will not, and do not, sell your information for valuable consideration (as defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act). Your information may be shared with third parties as set out above for our business purposes.

#### What we need you to do

We need to make sure that the information that we hold about you (and if you’re a business, your users) is accurate, up-to-date and still relevant. As a result, we need you to tell us promptly if there are any changes to the information that you (or they) have provided by letting us know at [DPO@egress.com](mailto:DPO@egress.com).

You must ensure that you always have (and if you’re a business, that your users always have) a lawful reason under applicable law for the processing of your Content and any third party email address through your use of our services, and you must comply with all applicable law in respect of how you use it.

#### How long we'll keep your and your users information for

We’ll keep CRM Information, Content, System Data and Smart Data in accordance with our data retention policies available at [www.egress.com/legal](https://web.archive.org/legal) including to maintain records required for legal or regulatory reasons, to show that we complied with our contractual obligations, to respond to any complaints or queries, and for research and statistical purposes.

#### Your rights as an individual

As an individual, you may have certain rights by law in respect of the personal data that we hold about you. These rights may not always apply as your location and the basis on which we’re processing your personal data may affect their availability.

#### Privacy Shield

We participate in the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks and have self-certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce our adherence to the Privacy Shield Principles for all personal information received from countries in the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom in reliance on the Privacy Shield.

We are liable for ensuring that the third parties we engage support our Privacy Shield commitments. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has regulatory enforcement authority over our processing of personal information received or transferred pursuant to Privacy Shield. We commit to cooperate and comply with the advice of the regulatory authorities to whom you may raise a concern about our processing of personal information about you pursuant to Privacy Shield, including to the panel established by the EU authorities and the Swiss FDPIC.
