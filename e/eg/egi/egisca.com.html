 <p><em>Last Updated: May 8, 2012 </em></p>
            <p>Egisca Corporation recognizes   the importance of protecting the privacy of all information provided by users of   our web sites,    recipients of our e-mail newsletters and all other customers of our products and   services. We created this policy with a fundamental respect for our customers'   right to privacy and to guide our relationships with our customers. This Privacy   Statement discloses the privacy practices for all products and services owned by   Egisca. </p>
            <p><strong>INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</strong><br>
              Egisca collects information   from our website users, subscribers and other customers. In this section of our   Privacy Statement, we describe the type of information we collect and how we use   it to provide better services to our customers.</p>
            <p><strong>Registration and Ordering</strong> <br>
              When attending our trade shows   and other in-person events, participating in our customer-sponsored webcasts,   using some of our websites and signing up for certain selected services (such as   free subscriptions), users must first register. During registration, users are   required to give their contact information (such as name, e-mail address,   mailing address and phone number). For internal purposes, we use this   information to communicate with users and provide requested services, and, for   our website visitors, to provide a more personalized experience on our sites. We   also may collect demographic information (such as job title and purchasing   responsibilities, company information and professional certification). We use   aggregate demographic information about our audience to improve our service, for   marketing purposes and/or industry reporting purposes. </p>
            <p>For our services that require payment (such as certain events, products and   subscriptions), we also collect credit card information (such as account name,   number and expiration date), which is used for billing   purposes only, and is not otherwise shared. </p>
            <p><strong>E-mail Newsletters</strong> <br>
              If users wish to subscribe to our   e-mail newsletters, we ask for contact information (such as name, e-mail address   and, occasionally, demographic information). We use this information in the same   manner as we use contact information in the registration and ordering process   described above. Recipients of our newsletters can unsubscribe using the   instructions listed at the end of the e-mail newsletter.
            </p><p><strong>Interactive Features</strong> <br>
            At some of our sites, we offer   interactive and community features such as discussion boards, webcasts and user   profiles. Note that all personal information sent or posted via such features   becomes public information for which we are not responsible. </p>
            <p><strong>Communications with Us</strong> <br>
            We have features where our   customers can submit information to us (such as our feedback forms). Where such   submissions include requests for service, support or information, we may forward   them to our agents, as needed, to best respond to the specific request. In   addition, we may retain e-mails and other information sent to us for our   internal administrative purposes, and to help us to serve customers better.</p>
            <p><strong>Communications from Us: Service Updates, Special Offers</strong> <br>
              In order to best serve our customers, we may send updates that contain   important information about our products and services. For example, we send new   members a welcoming message, and verify password and username for our   password-protected web sites. We may also communicate with a customer to provide   requested services and for account-related issues via e-mail, phone or regular   mail. In addition to such service and product-essential messages, we offer our   customers the option to receive information about our company, related products,   services and special deals. Users, however, can choose not to receive these   communications from us.</p>
            <p><strong>Automatic Data Collection </strong><br>
              Our web sites, newsletters   and, from time to time, certain other products and services have features that   automatically collect information from customers, to deliver content specific to   customers' interests and to honor their preferences. This information assists us   in creating products and services that will serve the needs of our customers. </p>
            <p>For example, we use "cookies," a piece of data stored on the user's hard   drive containing information about the user. Cookies benefit the user by   requiring login only once, thereby saving time while on our web site. If users   reject the cookies, they may be limited in the use of some areas of our web   site. For example, the user may not be able to participate in sweepstakes,   contests or drawings. Additionally, we may note some of the pages the user   visits on our web sites and via our email newsletters through the use of pixel   tags (also called clear gifs) and web beacons. The use of cookies, pixels and   web beacons enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance   the experience on our sites and via our email newsletters. </p>
            <p>We also use an email delivery and marketing company to send emails (including   newsletters) for which you have registered (or otherwise agreed to receive). Web   beacons and cookies may be used in such email messages to help us measure the   effectiveness of our advertising and how customers use our web sites and other   products and services. </p>
            <p>For our internal purposes, we gather date, time, browser type, navigation   history and IP address of all visitors to our web sites. This information does   not contain anything that can identify users personally. We use this information   for our internal security audit log, trend analysis and system administration,   and to gather broad demographic information about our user base for aggregate   use. </p>
            <p>We may combine demographic information supplied by a customer at registration   with web site usage data to provide general profiles, in aggregate   non-personally identifiable form, about our customers and their preferences in   the content of the site and advertising. We may share this composite information   with our advertisers and business affiliates to help them better understand our   services. </p>
            <p><strong>CORRECTION/UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong> <br>
  If your   personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code), or if you no   longer desire our product(s)/service(s), we provide a way to correct or update   your personal data: you may either contact Customer Support for the applicable   product or service or, to change your preferences.</p>
            <p><strong>SECURITY<br>
            </strong>We use reasonable precautions to protect our   customers' personal information and to store it securely. Sensitive information   that is transmitted to us online (such as credit card number) is encrypted and   is transmitted to us securely. In addition, access to all of our customers'   information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted.   Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example,   a billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to   personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers on which we store   personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment. </p>
            <p><strong>LINKS</strong> <br>
              Our web sites contain links to other sites. Egisca is   not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other sites. We   encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy   statements of each web site to which we may link that may collect personally   identifiable information. </p>
            <p><strong>CHILDREN</strong><br>
              Egisca websites are not directed at individuals   under thirteen years of age, and Egisca does not intend to collect any   personally-identifiable information from such individuals.</p>
            <p><strong>NOTIFICATION and CHANGES</strong> <br>
              If we change our Privacy   Statement, we will post those changes on this page so our users are aware of   what information we collect, how we use it and under which circumstances, if   any, we disclose it. Users should check this policy frequently to keep abreast   of any changes. </p>
