## EAB Website Privacy Policy

EAB Global, Inc. (which is referred to in this Privacy Policy as "EAB," "us," "we," or "our") operates multiple websites, www.eab.com, and several web-based applications and online services (each an "EAB website," collectively, the "EAB websites"). This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you, a visitor to the EAB websites, of our policies and practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of any Personal Information EAB websites collect or receive. EAB will not use Personal Information provided through your use of EAB websites except as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

## Collection of Information

### Personal information

"Personal information" is information that identifies you and may include your name, address, email address, telephone or fax number, company name, IP address, any content you post in your resume or CV, and any other information you may provide to us that identifies you.

### Sources of personal information

We collect Personal Information that you provide on an EAB website or through other sources like postal mail, telephone, or fax. We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via the EAB websites in order to provide you with EAB products and services and to improve the products and services we provide.

### Member information

If you or your organization is a member of an EAB program and access the restricted, members-only area of an EAB website, we may collect additional Personal Information relating to your participation in EAB programs. For example, EAB may obtain information about your access and use of EAB research materials, decision-support tools, and other online and offline offerings. Please note that we also collect Personal Information relating to you at the time you or your organization enrolled in an EAB program or programs, as well as in the course of allocating and issuing to you your unique ID and password to access the members-only areas of EAB websites. Please be aware also that others could view some of your Personal Information when you post a message to one of our online blogs in a members-only area of an EAB website.

EAB members also should be aware that, by participating in our online and offline networks and services, such as retreats, blogs, and other conferences, Personal Information about you and/or your individual employees might be made available or visible to other EAB members throughout the world to facilitate intelligence sharing across our membership. If you are uncomfortable with this transfer of your or your individual employees’ Personal Information, you should not use those services.

If a member of an EAB program provides us with identifiable information regarding the member's students or employees to facilitate their use of an EAB product or service, in compliance with the applicable laws, such data is also subject to any agreed upon restrictions in the written agreement between the member and EAB, , as well as additional protections under other EAB privacy and information security policies. If you have any questions regarding these additional policies, please contact our Legal Department, using the contact information listed below.

### Information collected automatically

When you visit EAB websites, we automatically collect and analyze certain information about your computer. This information includes, but may not be limited to, the IP address used to connect your computer to the Internet, information about your browser type and language, the date and time you are accessing the website, the content of any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us, and the referring website address.

### Cookies and other technologies

We use various technologies to collect information about your and your organization’s activities on an EAB website.

**Cookies** : When you visit an EAB website, we may assign your computer one or more “cookies.” A cookie is a small text file that contains information that can later be read by us to facilitate your access to the site and personalize your online experience. For example, when you sign into an EAB website, we may record your user ID in a cookie file on your computer. In addition, through the use of a cookie, we may automatically collect information about your online activity on EAB websites, such as the web pages you visit, the links you click, and the searches you conduct. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies by visiting the Help portion of your browser’s toolbar. If you choose to decline cookies, please note that you may not be able to sign in or use some of the interactive features offered on the EAB websites.

**Google Drive** : When you visit certain EAB websites, we may allow users with Google Drive accounts to attach documents from their Google Drive Account to a submitted college enrollment application. The EAB website receives documents selected from a user’s Google Drive account during the application process. Such documents are stored temporarily and included in the user’s complete, delivered application.

**Other technologies** : We may use standard Internet technology, such as web beacons (also called clear GIFs or pixel tags) and other similar technologies, to deliver or communicate with cookies and track your use of EAB websites. We also may include web beacons in e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. The information we obtain in this manner enables us to customize the services we offer and measure the overall effectiveness of our online content, advertising campaigns, and the products and services offered through the site.

### Information collected by third parties

Third parties, such as vendors, advertising entities, and business partners, may use cookies and other technologies (such as web beacons) to collect information about your online activities. The purposes for collecting this information includes: to measure usage of EAB websites; to analyze, modify, and personalize advertising content on EAB websites; and to provide ads about goods and services we hope will be of interest to you. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features these third parties may use, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Policy. Some of these third parties may be third-party network advertisers that offer you the option of not having this information collected.

We may also share aggregate or anonymous information with third parties, including advertisers, investors, and partners. This information does not contain any Personal Information and is used to develop content and services.

We may disclose any information we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or government regulation.

## Information Security

EAB has implemented technical and organizational security measures to help protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of Personal Information. We review our systems regularly to help ensure that the security and integrity of Personal Information in our possession is not compromised. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be entirely secure, and we do not assume any liability for any damage suffered by you caused by the interception, alteration, or misuse of information during transmission that is outside of our reasonable control.

Within EAB, we restrict access to Personal Information to employees, contractors, and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop, or improve our programs and services. As described above, we subject our third party contractors and agents to contractual controls to help ensure that they apply suitable protections to any Personal Information they access or receive from us.

## Children

EAB websites contain business-related content and are specifically aimed at and designed for use by adults. We do not knowingly solicit or collect Personal Information from or about individuals under the age of 13 years other than from EAB members that provide such information to us as part of an EAB program. If we discover that we have received Personal Information from an individual whom we believe to be under the age of 13 in some other manner, we will delete such information from our systems.
