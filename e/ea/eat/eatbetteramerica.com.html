<p>At General Mills, we are very sensitive to the privacy concerns of visitors to all 
of our websites, including this one. Though we do not obtain any personal information 
that individually identifies you (e.g., your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, 
etc.) unless you affirmatively provide it to us, many visitors do choose to provide us with 
such information. This Privacy Policy explains our online information practices and the 
choices you, as a visitor to this site, can make about the collection and use of your 
information.</p>
<p><b>What personal information might we ask you for and how do we use it?</b><br>
We collect personal information from you (such as your name, address, phone number, e-mail 
address, etc.) only when you voluntarily provide it to us. Here are the circumstances in 
which we might ask for personal information from our consumers though our site, the types 
of information we obtain, and how we use the information:</p>
<ul>
<li>
 Because our goal is to provide you with content that is relevant to you, we will ask you 
 for your gender, your activity level, your age and the health area that you are interested 
 in. </li>
 <li>
 If you contact one of our Consumer Services Representatives through our site, we may ask 
 you for personal information such as your name, address, phone number, or e-mail address 
 so that we can respond to your questions or comments. (Of course, if you send us an e-mail, 
 we will at a minimum obtain your e-mail address.)</li>
 <li>You may be asked to provide personal information if you:<br>
- register for a sweepstakes, contest, or other promotion;<br>
- register as a user of our site;<br>
- register to receive coupons through our site;<br>
- join a club through our site;<br>
- participate in a survey, a consumer research panel, or similar type of activity;<br>
- ask to receive an online newsletter or other information or material from us; or<br>
- otherwise participate in features of our website that ask for personal information.</li>

<li>If you purchase or otherwise request a product, publication, or promotional offering 
from us or take advantage of a rebate or similar offer, you may be required to provide your 
contact and/or payment information (such as a credit card number) in order for us to process 
your request.</li></ul>

<p>Your participation in any of these activities (and therefore your provision of personally 
identifiable information) is entirely voluntary. We may use the information you provide 
to send you your meal plan, to respond to your questions or comments, to administer our 
promotions and sites, to fulfill your request, subscription, or order, or to otherwise 
provide or improve our products and services. We will not send you any online newsletter 
or similar e-mail communication unless you expressly consent to receive such a communication 
from us. And if you do choose to receive any such e-mail communication from us, you will 
always have the opportunity to “unsubscribe” from receiving the e-mail at any time.</p>

<p><b>How do we use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies?</b><br>
  We may employ cookie technology, web beacons, and similar devices on our site to 
  facilitate site administration and navigation and to provide an enhanced online experience 
  for our visitors. Information tracked through these mechanisms includes but is not 
  limited to (1) a user’s IP address (e.g., yahoo.com - 192.168.1.1), (2) the type of 
  web browser (e.g., Microsoft Explorer) and operating system (e.g., Windows or Linux) 
  being used, (3) the pages of the site a user visits, and (4) other websites a user 
  visited before visiting our site.</p>
<p>Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but can be configured not to do so or to 
notify the user when a cookie is being sent. If you wish to disable cookies, refer to 
your browser help menu to learn how to disable cookies. Please note that if you disable 
cookies, you may be unable to access some customized features on our site. Cookies do 
not collect or contain your name or e-mail address.</p>
<p>Web beacons are 1x1 single-pixel graphics that allow us to count the number of users 
who have visited a particular web page or to access certain cookies. We may use web 
beacons on our websites to count users and to recognize users by accessing their 
cookies. Being able to access our cookies allows us to personalize our website 
and improve your experience at our website. We may also include web beacons in 
HTML-formatted e-mail messages that we send to determine which e-mail messages 
were opened. Like cookies, web beacons do not collect or contain your name or 
your e-mail address.</p>
<p><b>When might we provide other parties with your personal information?</b><br>
  We may share your personal information with other parties if you consent to us sharing 
  such information with third parties.</p>
<p>We also may provide your personal information to third parties who provide services on 
our behalf. These parties may use the information solely in conjunction with the specific 
services they provide for us (e.g., fulfillment of an order, responding to your question 
or comment, providing a sweepstakes prize, deployment of a consumer survey, investigation 
of a complaint, etc.).</p>
<p>We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event that we 
sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets to a third party. We also 
reserve the right to share information within General Mills amongst our various businesses.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to disclose any personal information as needed if such information 
is requested by law enforcement agencies or if we are required to do so by law, regulation, 
subpoena, court order, or by a government entity. We also may disclose personal information 
to third parties if we have reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary 
to conduct investigations of possible breaches of law, to cooperate in any legal investigation, 
or to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating the terms of 
use of our site.</p>
<p><b>Security for credit card, data and transaction information</b><br>
  At General Mills, we are committed to keeping your online transactions safe and secure. In 
  order to reasonably assure the privacy and security of your credit card and other personal 
  data when making an order, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL uses encryption 
  technology to create a secure connection between your computer and ours. We have also put 
  procedures in place to safeguard the information/data we collect from you. We cannot absolutely 
  guarantee the security of any information you provide online; you provide it at your own risk.</p>
<p><b>Links to other sites</b><br>
  Our site may contain links to the websites of our subsidiaries and affiliates, and to websites 
  that are owned and operated by third parties. These other websites may have their own privacy 
  policies and would not be governed by this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the 
  privacy practices or the content of websites owned and operated by any such third parties. 
  Other websites may collect and treat information collected differently, so we encourage you 
  to carefully read and review the privacy policy for each website you visit.</p>
<p><b>Chat rooms and message/bulletin boards</b><br>
  Users of chat rooms and message/bulletin boards that may be on our site should be aware that 
  when they voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e.g., name, e-mail address, 
  etc.) on a message/bulletin board, in a chat area, or other interactive area where personal 
  information can be posted, the information can be collected and used by other internet users. 
  This may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or parties. We make no 
  representations and undertake no obligations as to the security of information you voluntarily 
  post in chat rooms and message/bulletin boards.  </p>
<p><b>Send-to-a-friend tools</b><br>
  This site may, from time to time, include a send-to-a-friend application that makes it easy for 
  you to forward information or materials from our site to friends or family by e-mail. In order 
  to address your e-mail message, the application will ask you to input the recipient’s e-mail 
  address and/or similar information (including your e-mail address). This information is only 
  used by the application to address your message so that it can be properly sent. General Mills 
  does not retain any of this information for any purpose.</p>
<p><b>Our commitment to children’s privacy</b><br>
  A special note to parents: This site is not directed to children and we will not request any 
  information from children under 13 at this site. General Mills does have other websites that 
  are geared in whole or in part to a child audience. Our commitment to the privacy of children 
  is described more fully in the privacy policies of those websites. General Mills and its 
  affiliated companies take special care of the privacy of children under the age of 13. We 
  have developed our privacy practices as they relate to children from guidelines established 
  by the Children’s Advertising Review Unit (CARU) and in compliance with the requirements 
  established by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”). We also 
  recommend that parents monitor their children’s Internet activities and learn and employ 
  software or other tools which can help their children enjoy the fun and entertainment of an 
  on-line experience without compromising their personal safety or allowing them to use the 
  Internet in a manner inconsistent with their parents’ preferences.</p>
<p><b>United States only</b><br>
  This website is intended for use by residents of the United States of America only. All 
  matters 
  relating to this site are governed by the laws of the State of Minnesota in the United States 
  of America. If you are located outside of the United States of America and you contact us, 
  please be advised that any information you provide to us will be transferred to the United 
  States of America and that by submitting information, you explicitly authorize its transfer.</p>
<p><b>Changes in our online privacy policy</b><br>
  We reserve the right to change or replace this Privacy Policy at our sole discretion at any 
  time. Please check back from time to time to ensure that you are aware of any updates or 
  changes in this Privacy Policy.</p>
