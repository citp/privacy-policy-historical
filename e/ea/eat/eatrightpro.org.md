#### Open Forums

Any information you disclose on any electronic mailing list or other open forum hosted by the Academy may be collected by others and used, without authorization by the Academy, to send you unsolicited non-Academy information or for other purposes.

#### External Links

Any of the Academy websites may contain links to other external websites that do not fall under the domain of the eatright websites. eatright websites are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such external websites. The Academy does not endorse the content, products or services on other websites.

#### Pop-Up Advertising

Some users have reported that advertisements for products, such as diet pills, pop up on their computer screens when they log onto Academy websites. The Academy has nothing to do with these pop-up ads and does not sanction or control them in any way.

These ads are triggered by software on the viewer's computer that may have been unwittingly installed as part of a free software package. The most common case is with music and file sharing software that is given away free to consumers. After installation, the software keeps track of the sites the user logs onto and when the person goes to any site that is on a special list, an ad pops up. Advertisers pay for this and select the sites they want their ads to be associated with.

The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics does not approve of this practice and has written to government leaders requesting that legislation be passed to prohibit it.

#### Security

These sites have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.

#### Other Uses of Personal Information

The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (the Academy) also uses Personal Information, including information provided to us from our Service Providers, to continually assess and improve the products and services we offer. To serve you better, we may combine Personal Information that you give us on our Sites or via phone, email or mail with publicly available information and information we receive from or cross-reference with our marketing partners and others. We use that combined information to enhance and personalize your experience with us, to communicate with you about services and events that may be of interest to you, and for other informational purposes.
