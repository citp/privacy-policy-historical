### HOW DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION? 

**Disclosure of Your PII or personal data to Third-Parties**  
Except as provided below, we do not share your information with non-affiliated third parties without your permission. 

We may disclose information you provide via our Websites in connection with the sale, assignment, or other transfer of the business or a portion of the business of our Websites or any other part of our business, including a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, sale of assets or other corporate change of our direct or indirect parent companies that affects us.

We may need to release PII or personal data when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a criminal investigation, a court order, or legal process served on our Website. We may also share your personal information if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of the terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.

Service Providers/Trusted Vendors: We also may disclose information to outside companies that help us bring you products and services. For example, we may work with an outside company to: (a) process credit card transactions; (b) manage a database of customer information; (c) assist us in distributing emails; (d) assist us with direct marketing and data collection; (e) provide us storage and analysis; (f) provide fraud prevention; and (g) other services designed to assist us in maximizing our business potential. We require that these outside companies agree to keep confidential all information we share with them and to use the information only to perform their obligations in the agreements.

In addition, the Academy may use your PII or personal data or disclose this information to third parties to contact you about products or services we think may be of interest to you.

**Open Forums**  
Any information you disclose on any electronic mailing list or other open forum hosted by the Academy may be collected by others and used, without authorization by the Academy, to send you unsolicited non-Academy information or for other purposes.

**External Links**  
Any of the Academy Websites may contain links to other external websites that do not fall under the domain of our Websites. The Academy is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such external websites. The Academy does not endorse the content, products or services on other websites. 

**Pop-Up Advertising**  
Some users have reported that advertisements for products, such as diet pills, pop up on their computer screens when they log onto Academy Websites. The Academy has nothing to do with these pop-up ads and does not sanction or control them in any way. 

These ads are triggered by software on the viewer's computer that may have been unwittingly installed as part of a free software package. The most common case is with music and file sharing software that is given away free to consumers. After installation, the software keeps track of the Websites the user logs onto and when the person goes to any site that is on a special list, an ad pops up. Advertisers pay for this and select the sites they want their ads to be associated with.

The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics does not authorize or approve of this practice and has written to government leaders requesting that legislation be passed to prohibit it.

**Posted Content**  
We may post content on our Websites that you have posted at ours or other websites, e.g., Google (“ **User Content** ”). You agree to and do hereby grant us a royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, and worldwide right to Use, modify, and perform any User Content we post to our Websites. The term “ **Use** ” includes, but is not limited to, use, reproduce, modify, publish, list information regarding, edit, translate, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, and make derivative works of the content. 

**Security**  
These Websites have security measures in place designed to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. 

**Other Uses of Personal Information**  
The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics also uses PII, including information provided to us from trusted vendors, to continually assess and improve the products and services we offer. To serve you better, we may combine information that you give us on our Websites or via phone, email or mail with publicly available information and information we receive from or cross-reference with our marketing partners and others. We use that combined information to enhance and personalize your experience with us, to communicate with you about services and events that may be of interest to you, and for other informational purposes. 

The Academy provides member/customer names and preferred postal addresses (home or work as specified by each individual member/customer) and access to an email deployment (email addresses are never released) to list renters that may be used only for a one-time use mail/email piece approved by (the Academy). Phone numbers and fax numbers are not made available for rental. Email addresses are not released to any third party except contracted service providers who act on behalf of the Academy. The Academy reserves the right to send email communication to Academy members/ customers via email on behalf of a third party, subject to approval by the Academy. Academy members/ customers have the ability to opt out of such mailings and email communications, resulting in such customer's name and address not being included in mailing list rentals and customer's email address being excluded from third party communication.

If you do not wish to receive screened third party offerings via email or postal mail, please email us at [membership@eatright.org](mailto:membership@eatright.org).

**Cookies and IP Addresses**  
"Cookies" are small pieces of information stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. They provide greater security for Websites that provide personalized information.

A unique number called an IP address identifies every computer on the Internet. Each time you connect to the Internet your machine is assigned an IP address. An IP address is a number that identifies each sender or receiver of information that is sent in packets across the Internet.

We will keep your personal information for as long as your account is active, or as long as you are a registered member or account holder or user of our services or for as long as we have another business purpose to do so and, thereafter, for no longer than is required or permitted by law, or our records retention policy, reasonably necessary for internal reporting and reconciliation purposes, or to provide you with feedback or information you might request. This period of retention is subject to our review and alteration. The information we collect may be stored and processed in servers in the United States and wherever we and our service providers have facilities around the globe.

### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR NON-US RESIDENTS

Due to differing laws and legal practice, be aware that law enforcement agencies in the United States may have access to your Personal Information.

If you are located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from the laws in the United States, please note that we may transfer your information to a country or jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction.

As of May 25, 2018, the Directive and local legislation based on the Directive is replaced by the Regulations (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal information and on the free movement of such data, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and our processing will take place in accordance with the GDPR. For purposes of the GDPR, we will be the “data controller” of personal information (referred to in the GDPR as “personal data”, and which is defined differently in this Privacy Policy) we collect through the Websites, unless we collect such information on behalf of a “data controller” in which case we will be a “data processor.” This Privacy Policy does not apply to websites, applications or services that do not display or link to this Privacy Policy or that display or link to a different Privacy Policy.

**Data Transfers**  
We are headquartered in the United States. As such, we and our service providers may transfer your personal information to, or access it in, jurisdictions that may not provide equivalent levels of data protection as your home jurisdiction. We will take steps to ensure that your personal information receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it. If you are located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or Switzerland, we provide adequate protection for the transfer of personal information to countries outside of the EEA or Switzerland through a series of intercompany agreements based on the Standard Contractual Clauses. We may also need to transfer your information to other group companies or service providers in countries outside the EEA. This may happen if our servers or suppliers and service providers are based outside the EEA, or if you use our services and products while visiting countries outside this area.
