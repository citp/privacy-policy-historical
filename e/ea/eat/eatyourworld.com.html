	<span> </span></p>
<p>
	<b>WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?</b></p>
<p>
	<span>This Privacy Policy covers Company’s treatment of personally identifiable information (</span>“<span>Personal Information</span>”<span>) that Company gathers when you are accessing Company’s Website and when you use Company services. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Company does not own or control, or to individuals that Company does not employ or manage.</span></p>
<p>
	<b>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES COMPANY COLLECT?</b></p>
<p>
	<span>The information we gather from custo</span><span>mers enables us to personalize and improve our services, and to allow our users to set up a user account and make purchases via the Website. We collect the following types of information from our customers.</span></p>

You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features, and you may not be able to complete a purchase through the Website.

<p>
	<b>What About Cookies?</b></p>
<ul type="disc">

</ul>
<p>
	<b><span>WILL COMPANY SHARE ANY OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION IT RECEIVES?</span></b></p>
<p>
	<span>Personal Information about our customers is an integral part of our business. We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone. We share your Personal Information only as described below.</span></p>
<p>
	<em><span>Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:</span></em><span> We are affiliated with a variety of businesses and work closely with them. In certain situat</span><span>ions, these businesses sell items to you through Company’s Website. In other situations, Company provides services, or sells products jointly with affiliated businesses. You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with your transaction, and we will share your Personal Information that is related to such transactions with that affiliated business.</span></p>
<p>
	<em>Employees:</em><span> We restrict access to your Personal Information to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you.</span></p>
<p>
	<em><span>Business Transfers:</span></em><span> In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Company, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Company goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that suc</span><span>h transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Company may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.</span></p>
<p>
	<em><span>Protection of Company and Others:</span></em><span> We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with that law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Company, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</span></p>
<p>
	<b>IS PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT ME SECURE?</b></p>
<p>
	<span>Your Company account Personal Information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.</span></p>
<p>
	<span>When Company’s order form asks users to enter Personal Information such as a credit card number, that information is encrypted with industry-standard Secure Socket Layers (</span>“<span>SSL</span>”<span>) encryption to keep your online order safe and secure. When the letters </span>“<span>http</span>”<span> in the URL address change to </span>“<span>https</span>,”<span> the </span>“<span>s</span>”<span> indicates you are in a secure area employing</span><span> SSL. Company also maintains physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect your Personal Information.</span></p>
<p>
	<span>Company endeavors to protect user information to ensure that user account information is kept private, however, Company cannot guarantee the security of user account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.</span></p>
