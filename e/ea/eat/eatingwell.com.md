# EatingWell 's Privacy Policy

| ****PRIVACY****

******What We Collect**

When you order a free issue or subscription from us, we ask you to provide your name, shipping address, e-mail address and credit-card information/billing address if applicable. This information allows us to process and fulfill your order. Without it, we wouldn't be able to get you the magazine products you want. During the order process, you have the option to allow or disallow your e-mail address to be added to our mailing list. If you do not want to receive any information from us concerning special promotions, savings, or events, please make sure to change the Mailing List option button to "no". 

**What We Do With It**

  * At no time will we release your credit-card information to anyone.
  * Internal Use - Personal Information.   
From time to time we carry out promotional events, such as sales, special offerings, bonus 'gifts', and so on. We like to offer these to our existing and preferred customers first. To do so, we might send our customers an e-mail notification or reminder of the event taking place. Again, if you do not want to receive anything of this type, please switch the Mailing List option button to "no" during the order process. Alternatively, feel free to e-mail us at [customerservice@eatingwell.com](mailto:customerservice@eatingwell.com) and request that your name be removed from the list. 
  * Demographic Data.   
We regularly aggregate our sales and market information based on our customers' purchases. We use this information to be certain we are offering the right products at the right time. We like to understand what regions of the country buy more products from us, what products are the most popular, and how our business is doing. This information is not linked to a specific customer: no names, addresses or credit-card information are used or released. 
  * Our Partners and Your Information.   
If you come to our site from one of our partners' sites and then purchase a product, we are obligated to share sales and demographic data relative to that transaction with our partner. To enable us to do so, we provide our partners with a tracking code that gets attached to the URLs you visit. These codes are specific to our partners, not to the individual user. The information given back to our partners from these codes only includes demographic sales and marketing information and does not include any personal or credit-card information. From time to time, when involved in a co-promotion with a partner, we may use our e-mail mailing list (from which, again, you have the option to remove yourself) to notify you. Alternatively, if the co-promotional event is being led by our partner, we may make our mailing list available to them -- only for that one-time event. 



**Cookies** ****  
We do employ a cookie on our site for the sole purpose of tracking site traffic (a cookie is a piece of data sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your hard drive). The cookie tells us if you have visited our site before or if you are a first-time visitor. This lets us know how we are doing at both attracting new visitors and bring our old ones back. Armed with this marketing information, we can continue to refine our site so that it best meets your needs as our customer. 

To avoid having a cookie attached, set your browser to refuse all cookies. 

**Security**  
We gather and store all your personal information, including credit-card information, on our secure server. Only specified EATINGWELL staff has access to this information at any time. No outside third party is ever given access to your information. 

**Your Options** ****  
In keeping with common order-processing and customer-acquisition practices, we do cooperatively share database lists. We do run our lists against the Direct Marketing Association's national Do-Not-Promote list to ensure we do not send mail to anyone who has put their name on this list. From time to time, we might opt to have companies (those we feel will be of interest to you) send you information about themselves. If you are a mail-order or Internet customer and have not told us to withhold your information, from time to time you may receive promotional offers from related cooking and health companies. If you are a mail-order customer and would prefer to be removed from this list, please call our Customer Service number (800-337-0402) and we will be happy to help you. 

Happy Eating,   
The EATINGWELL Staff
