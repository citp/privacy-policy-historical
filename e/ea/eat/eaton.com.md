# Privacy, Cookies and Data Protection Policy

Eaton and its affiliates (collectively, “Eaton,” or “we,” “us,” “our”) respect your concerns about personal data protection and value our relationship with you. This Privacy, Cookies and Data Protection Policy (the “Policy”) applies solely to personal data collected through Eaton web sites, web pages, portals, interactive features, applications, telephone support lines, email, widgets, blogs and their respective contents in addition to our Twitter, Facebook or other social networking sites, and their respective contents (collectively, the “Sites”), whether accessed via computer, mobile device or other device (collectively, “Device”).

This Policy describes the types of personal data we collect through the Sites and how that personal data may be used and/or with whom it may be shared. This Policy also describes how you can reach us to update your contact information, access and control the use of the personal data we collect in connection with our marketing communications and activities, or get answers to questions you may have about our privacy practices at these Sites. Please read this Policy carefully, because by using the Sites you are acknowledging that you understand and agree to the terms of this Policy. In addition, please review our [Terms & Conditions](https://web.archive.org/Eaton/OurCompany/TermsConditions/index.htm), which governs your use of the Sites and any content you submit to the Sites. 

**I. Cookies**  
Like many companies, Eaton uses “cookies” and similar tools on the Sites to improve their performance and enhance your user experience.

**What are Cookies?**  
A cookie is a small text file which is placed on your Device. Cookies help to analyze web traffic and allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences. Certain cookies may contain personal data – for example, if you click to “remember me” when logging in, a cookie may store your username. Most cookies won’t collect personal data that identifies you, and will instead collect more general information, such as how users arrive at and use our Sites, or a user’s general location.

**What do we use Cookies for?**  
Eaton may place cookies or similar files on your Device for security purposes, to tell us whether you have visited the Sites before, to remember your language preferences, if you are new visitor or to otherwise facilitate site navigation, and to personalize your experience while visiting our Sites. Cookies allow us to collect technical and navigational information, such as browser type, time spent on our Sites and pages visited. Cookies also allow us to select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to you and display them while you are on the Sites. Cookies may enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular Site. Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better Site by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your Device or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.

**What kinds of Cookies do we use?**  
Generally, the cookies that are used on the Sites can be broken down in to the following categories:

  * Session Cookies  
These cookies are used 'in-session' each time you visit and then expire when you leave a Site or shortly thereafter: they are not stored on your Device permanently, do not contain any personal data and help by minimizing the need to transfer personal data across the internet. These cookies can be deleted or you can refuse to allow their use, but this will hamper the performance and your experience in using the Sites. These cookies also take time stamps that record when you access a Site and when you leave a Site.
  * Tracking Cookies  
These cookies enable us to recognize repeat visitors to our Sites. By matching an anonymous, randomly generated identifier, a tracking cookie keeps track of where a user of our Sites came from, what search engine they may have used, what link they clicked on, what keyword they used and where they were in the world when they accessed a Site. By monitoring this data, we can make improvements to our Sites.
  * Persistent Cookies  
This type of cookie is saved on your Device for a fixed period (sometimes for a few hours, sometimes for a year or longer) and is not deleted when the browser is closed. Persistent cookies are used where we need to remember who you are for more than one browsing session. For example, this type of cookie can be used to store your preferences, so that they are remembered for the next visit to a Site.
  * Performance or Analytical Cookies  
Performance cookies are used to analyze how the Sites are used and to monitor their performance, which allows us to improve your experience in using the Sites. These cookies help us to tailor the content of the Sites to reflect what the Site users find most interesting and to identify when technical issues with the Sites arise. We may also use this data to compile reports to help us to analyze how Sites are used, what the most common issues are and how we can improve the Sites.



**Can the Cookies be blocked?**  
You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you would prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will allow you to: (i) change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) to disable existing cookies; or (iii) to set your browser to automatically reject any cookies. However, please be aware that if you disable or reject cookies, some features and services on our Sites may not work properly because we may not be able to recognize and associate you with your Eaton account(s). In addition, the offers we provide when you visit us may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests.

**II. Privacy & Data Protection Policy**

1\. INFORMATION COLLECTED ON OUR SITES

**Information You Provide To Us**  
Generally you can visit the Sites without providing personal data, unless otherwise mentioned in the Sites themselves. However there may be circumstances when you may be asked or choose to provide personal data that could reasonably be used to contact you or to identify you personally (such as your name, home address, telephone number, credit card data or email address (“Personal Data”) through the Sites. For example, Eaton may collect Personal Data when you register on the Sites, request information, purchase products or services, supply products or services, submit a resume, comments or participate in some promotion, survey or other feature of the Sites, or otherwise communicate or interact with us. The Sites may also ask you to provide other Personal Data about yourself, such as demographic data (gender, zip code, age, etc.) or certain information about your preferences, product use, and interests. If we combine demographic or other data we collect about you with Personal Data about you, we will treat the combined information as personal data according to the applicable laws, subject to your prior opt-in, if and when required by the applicable laws.. If you do not want your Personal Data processed by us, please do not submit it or notify us at any time to have it deleted.

**Data Collected by Automated Means**  
Whenever you visit or interact with the Sites, Eaton may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how the Sites are accessed and used (“usage data”). Usage data may include, in part, browser type, operating system, the page served, the time, how many users visited the Sites, and the preceding page views. Usage data is statistical data which provides us with information about the use of the Sites, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on the Sites, how long they stay on that page, and which hyperlinks, if any, they “click” on. This usage data helps us to keep the Sites fresh and interesting to our visitors and to tailor content to a visitor’s interests. Usage data is generally non-identifying, but if Eaton associates it with you as a specific and identifiable person, Eaton treats it as Personal Data.

In the course of collecting usage data, Eaton might also automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for the Device. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device when you access a web site or its servers, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. When you visit the Sites, we may view your Device Identifier. We use this data to determine the general physical location of your Device and understand from what regions of the world the visitors to the Sites come. We also may use this Personal Data to enhance the Sites.

The technologies used on the Sites to collect usage data, including Device Identifiers, may include cookies.

**2\. HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED**  
Eaton uses the Personal Data and usage data we collect through the Sites for a variety of business purposes, including for example, to: respond to your questions and requests; provide you with access to certain areas and features of the Sites; verify your identity; communicate with you about your account and activities on the Sites and, in our discretion, changes to any Eaton policy; tailor content, advertisements, and offers we serve you; send you samples, premiums, products and information; process payment for products or services purchased by you; process payment for products or services sold by you to Eaton; improve the Sites; develop new products and services; process applications and transactions; and for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your personal data or otherwise with your consent.

**3\. INFORMATION WE SHARE**  
We will not provide any of your Personal Data to any third parties without your specific consent, except as described in this Policy. We may share non-personal data, such as aggregate user statistics, demographic data, and usage data with third parties. We may also share your personal data in the following circumstances: third parties providing services on our behalf. In order to carry out your requests, to make various features, services and materials available to you through the Sites, and to respond to your inquiries, we may share your Personal Data or usage data with third parties that perform functions on our behalf (or on behalf of our business associates), such as companies or individuals that: host or operate our Sites; analyze data; provide customer service; mail product samples or manage payments; advertisers; sponsors or other third parties that participate in or administer our promotions or provide marketing or promotional assistance.

While on our Sites, you will have the opportunity to opt-in to receive information and/or marketing offers from us and from someone else or to otherwise consent to the sharing of your Personal Data with a third party. If you agree to have your Personal Data shared, your Personal Data will be disclosed to the third party and the Personal Data you disclose will be subject to the privacy policy of that third party.

**Business Transfers.**  
Your Personal Data may also be used by us or shared with our subsidiaries, affiliates and other entities in the family of companies controlled by Eaton for internal reasons, primarily for business and operational purposes mentioned herein. If another entity acquires us or all or a portion of our assets, Personal Data, usage data, and any other information that we have collected about the users of the Sites may be disclosed to such entity as part of the due diligence process and will be transferred to such entity as one of the transferred assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will require the transferee to use the Personal Data and usage data in a manner that is consistent with this Policy.

You may ask us to refrain from using and sharing your personal data (whether collected online or offline) among our affiliates for marketing purposes. Please tell us your preference by contacting us as indicated in the “How to Contact Us” section of this Policy.

**4\. INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM THIRD PARTIES**  
Eaton may receive your Personal Data or usage data from third parties. For example, if you are on another web site and you opt-in to be contacted by Eaton, that web site will forward to us your e-mail address and other Personal Data about you, so that we may contact you as requested. You may also choose to participate in a third party application or feature such as one of our Facebook or Twitter pages or a similar application or feature on a third party web site through which you allow us to collect and share (or the third party to collect and share) information about you, including Personal Data.

We may also supplement the Personal Data we collect about you through the Sites with other data from third parties in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you.
