Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to easytransitguides.com or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from easytransitguides.com or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to easytransitguides.com. 

1.2 Third Party List Information.
