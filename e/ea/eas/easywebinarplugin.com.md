One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize CSZ Corporation pages, or register with CSZ Corporation site or services, a cookie helps CSZ Corporation to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same CSZ Corporation website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the CSZ Corporation features that you customized.
