			<div class="textBlock">
Easy Spirit collects data that you provide to our sales associates in
our company-owned Easy Spirit stores and outlets and the stores and
outlets of our affiliated brands (including Nine West, Bandolino,
Kasper, Anne Klein, and Jones New York); on easyspirit.com and the
websites of our affiliated brands through transactions, email
registration, sweepstakes, contests, or online membership; or through
phone, mail and fax interactions or paper registrations that you
submit. <br><br>
			  Easy Spirit may collect and store two types of information: "personal information" and "automatic information."
			  <br><br>
Personal information tells us who you are such as your name, gender,
billing address, shipping address, email address, telephone number,
date of birth or age, any personal preferences you choose to provide,
transaction details such as style, size, price, discount, date, store,
your credit card number and expiration date used for transactions, and
an assigned password to protect your privacy. <br><br> Automatic information is information that we collect
automatically whenever you interact with this website such as your IP
address, the type of computer you use, and the web browser you use. An
IP address is a number assigned to your computer when you connect to
the Internet. Each time you visit this site, our web server may
automatically recognize and collect this information. <br><br> Automatic information also includes "cookies" and "web
beacons". A "cookie" is a small amount of data that is sent to your
browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive.
Among other things, cookies provide a means for us to keep track of
your online patterns and preferences. By understanding which areas of
the site you visit, cookies allow us to present information, products
and services that are of personal interest. A cookie will not allow us
to learn any personal information (such as your real name and address)
that you have not otherwise disclosed. Most browsers are initially set
up to accept cookies. You can change your browser so that it will not
automatically accept cookies. However, if you do so, it is possible
that some portions of the site may not function as intended. "Web
beacons", also known as clear GIFs or single-pixel GIFs, are small
image files that we may place on web pages and within web-based email
newsletters that we send. Working in conjunction with cookies, web
beacons allow us to accurately count the number of unique users who
have visited a specific page and the number of times those pages are
displayed. We can also use web beacons to let us know how many people
opened a web-based email newsletter. <br><br> We may associate automatic information with your
personal information. In the event of such association, such automatic
information will be considered personal information. <br><br> Finally, Easy Spirit occasionally obtains email
addresses of active Easy Spirit store customers who requested fashion
emails on other websites. Easy Spirit also reserves the right to obtain
publicly accessible customer demographics. </div>
			<div class="contHeader"><a name="use" id="use"></a>How does Easy Spirit use this information?</div>
			<div class="textBlock">
Easy Spirit uses this information to confirm and process sales
transactions or to contact you with questions or communications about
your order, or to respond to your customer service inquiries. <br><br> Easy Spirit also uses this information to enhance and
personalize your shopping experience, both online and in our stores, to
communicate with you for marketing and promotional purposes via
targeted postal pieces, phone messages, or personalized emails, and to
improve the effectiveness of our websites and business activities. You
may indicate your contact preferences regarding promotional
communications either directly to us online or to customer service
representatives. </div>
			<div class="contHeader"><a name="access" id="access"></a>How can you access your information?</div>
			<div class="textBlock">
			  You may access and edit the information that you provide online by signing in at easyspirit.com. Simply click on the "<a href="http://www.easyspirit.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-easyspirit-Site/default/Login-Show">Sign in or sign up</a>"
link from the home page and enter your email address and password to
access your information. You can request password help at any time by
clicking on the "<a href="http://www.easyspirit.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-easyspirit-Site/default/Login-Show">I don't have/know my password</a>" link, at
which time easyspirit.com will email a password to the associated email
address. Currently, we do not provide online access to information that
you provided to Easy Spirit offline. But at any time you may request
access to your information from our customer service representatives. </div>
			<div class="contHeader"><a name="protect" id="protect"></a>How does Easy Spirit protect your information?</div>
			<div class="textBlock">
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be
unconditionally guaranteed to be secure. Therefore any information you
transmit to us is sent at your own risk. <br><br> However, when you place an order online, we use
encryption technology, such as Secure Socket Layer Technology ("SSL"),
to protect your personal information during data transport. SSL
encrypts your order information, including your name, address, and
credit card number, before it is transmitted to us to avoid the
decoding of your information by anyone other than Easy Spirit. <br><br> In addition, when you create an online account on
easyspirit.com, you must select a personal password. As a member of
Easy Spirit's website, you will be able to view, among other things,
your account profile, contact preferences, order history, and address
book. We store this type of information so that you do not have to
reenter it each time you make a purchase or visit the website. Should
you decide to become a member of Easy Spirit's website, you will be
asked to provide an accurate email address and create a password. In
order to help protect your personal information, you should be careful
about maintaining the secrecy of your password. </div>

			 Jones Apparel Group, Inc. is the parent company for Easy Spirit. <a href="http://www.jny.com" target="_new">Jones Apparel Group</a> maintains a single database of customer information for several brands owned by the
			 Jones Apparel Group family of companies, including <a href="http://www.easyspirit.com" target="_new">Easy Spirit</a>, <a href="http://www.ninewest.com" target="_new">Nine West</a>, <a href="http://www.bandolino.com" target="_new">Bandolino</a>, <a href="http://www.kasper.com" target="_new">Kasper</a>, <a href="http://www.anneklein.com" target="_new">Anne Klein</a>

brands. For each customer in this database, Jones Apparel Group
maintains a separate set of contact preferences for each brand to which
that customer has provided her customer information. When you establish
or update your customer profile information with one of the Jones
Apparel Group brands, whether through a purchase, registration or email
sign-up at a company-owned or operated website, specialty store or
outlet store for one of the Jones Apparel Group brands, through a
customer service representative, or in any other communication you may
have with us, we will update your customer record on the Jones Apparel
Group database. We may disclose personal information to our affiliates
(including, without limitation, our parent, Jones Apparel Group) that
either are subject to this privacy policy or follow practices at least
as protective as those described in this privacy policy. <br><br> Except as described in this privacy policy, Easy Spirit
does not sell, rent or trade with third parties any personal
information you provide to us online or at our stores, nor do we share
such information with third parties. We may disclose personal
information about you to third parties who provide services to us and
who agree to maintain the confidentiality of such information in
accordance with this privacy policy and use the information only in
connection with the services they provide. These third parties may
provide a variety of services to us including, without limitation,
assisting us in fulfilling your transactions and customer service
inquiries, updating your customer information record in our database,
deploying our promotional offers to you, or fulfilling your request to <a href="http://www.easyspirit.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-easyspirit-Site/default/Subscribe-Unsubscribe">unsubscribe</a> from our email. We do not authorize those third parties to make any
			 other use of your information.
			 <br><br>
We may use and/or disclose to others information about your
demographics and use of our website in a manner that does not reveal
your identity. <br><br> We may disclose personal information in special cases
when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is
necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone
who may have breached our <a href="http://www.easyspirit.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-easyspirit-Site/default/Link-PageByDate?cid=TERMS">Conditions of Use</a>
or who may be causing injury to or interference with (either
intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, other users
of our website, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. <br><br> We may also disclose personal information when we
reasonably believe that the law requires it. We might sell or buy
subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, personally
identifiable information generally is one of the transferred business
assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing
privacy policy. Also, in the unlikely event that assets of Easy Spirit
are sold, personal information may be one of the transferred assets. <br><br>
			 Easy Spirit honors every request to <a href="http://www.easyspirit.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-easyspirit-Site/default/Subscribe-Unsubscribe">unsubscribe</a>
from receipt of emails within ten (10) days of receiving the request,
not only for promotional emails that Easy Spirit sends, but also for
emails about Easy Spirit that we permit other companies to send to
their own list of subscribers. </div>
