We want to give our users the best possible service and need key information to provide our fundraising service to you. Therefore, the main use of the information we collect is to enable the core functioning of the Platform for you and other users. 

In addition, we use the information provided by you and the information we collect about your use of the Platform to offer you a more personalised service to enhance your fundraising efforts.

You can opt-out of personalisation by setting the preferences in the 'Preferences' section of the ['My Account'](https://www.easyfundraising.org.uk/account/settings/) area of the Platform. We may still send you offers and fundraising tips but we will no longer use your personal data to customise them. 

We may use the data collected by us to contact you by telephone, e-mail, SMS or other means, to update you of new products, services, or changes to our service or your account.

We may use your information in an aggregated and anonymised form for analytic purposes, trend analysis and to inform how we evolve the easyfundraising service.

Any personal information you provide to us will only be used by us, our agents and service providers, and will not be disclosed unless we are obliged or permitted to do so by law.

We may share your information with third parties in the following circumstances:

3\. **Good Cause:** we share your Gift Aid Declaration and email address with your Good Cause where it has requested it in order to claim Gift Aid on your Donation. The Good Cause may also pass this information to HMRC; and 

3.  **Facebook** : we may share your email address with Facebook so that they can send you targeted marketing communications through their site in order to help you use the Platform. Facebook may also use the email addresses to algorithmically assemble a group of members whose profiles indicate similar online behaviour to yours and these members may then be targeted with advertisements concerning our Platform and services. Please note, we take all necessary steps to ensure any information provided to Facebook is not accessible publicly through their site. 

4. **Trustpilot:** we may share your first name, last name and email address with Trustpilot so that they may contact you and invite you to leave a review on your experiences of our Platform.

**How do Good Causes use data?**

As stated above, unless you choose to be anonymous to Good Causes when you donate or on whose behalf you fundraise, we will share your personal data with those Good Causes. When we pass your information to Good Causes, they also become a controller with respect to such personal data. This means that they are responsible for their own compliance with data protection laws when they use your personal data, and all such use is subject to the Good Cause’s own privacy policy. We are not responsible for Good Causes’ use of your personal data or the Good Cause’s compliance with applicable laws. 

When you donate to a Good Cause, we will ask whether or not you consent to receiving email from such Good Cause about the impact of your donation and other ways to support them including future events, campaigns and appeals. If you opt in to receiving such emails, we will pass your consent preference on to the Good Cause. Please note that the Good Cause will need to receive your personal data to send you emails you consent to receive. 

If you want to change your preferences for a Good Cause to use your data (to contact you or otherwise), please contact the Good Cause directly. 

If you choose to opt out of receiving emails from the Good Cause directly we will not be aware of that decision.

**Your Rights**

You have the right to: 

**Request access** to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it. You can request a copy of your data via the ‘Easyfundraising Data’ section of the ‘ [My Account](https://www.easyfundraising.org.uk/account/settings/)’ area. 

**Request correction** of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us. You can correct the data you have supplied to us in the ' [My Account](https://www.easyfundraising.org.uk/account/settings/)' area of the website. 

**Request erasure** of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request. We delete all personal information collected in relation to Supporters and Good Causes if the data subject cancels his/her registration with the Website, although we may retain such information in anonymised form. You may request that we delete your account and all information relating to your account by using the Delete Your Account functionality in the 'Easyfundraising Data' area of the ['My Account'](https://www.easyfundraising.org.uk/account/settings/) section of the website or sending an email to us at [ support@easyfundraising.org.uk ](mailto:support@easyfundraising.org.uk?subject=DELETE%20ACCOUNT) with the heading 'DELETE ACCOUNT'. 

**Object to processing** of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms. Options for managing this can be found in the 'Preferences' section of the ' [My Account](https://www.easyfundraising.org.uk/account/settings/)' area. 

**Request restriction** of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. Options for managing this can be found in the 'Preferences' section of the ' [My Account](https://www.easyfundraising.org.uk/account/settings/)' area. 

**Request the transfer** of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you. You can request a copy of your data via the ‘Easyfundraising Data’ section of the ‘ [My Account](https://www.easyfundraising.org.uk/account/settings/)’ area. 

**Withdraw consent** at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent. 

If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please use the ‘My Account’ area of the Platform, or contact us. [support@easyfundraising.org.uk](mailto:support@easyfundraising.org.uk?subject=Withdraw%20Consent)

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. 

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response. 

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated. 

**Contact Us**

If, at any time, you would like to contact Easyfundraising about your views on this Policy, or in relation to your rights in respect of your personal information, you can do so by sending an e-mail to our Data Protection Office, Louise Mullock at [dpo@easyfundraising.org.uk](mailto:dpo@easyfundraising.org.uk).
