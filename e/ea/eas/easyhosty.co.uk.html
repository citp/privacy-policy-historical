<p>Your right to privacy is very important. EasyHosty recognise that when you choose to provide us with information about yourself, you trust us to act in a responsible manner. We believe this information should only be used to help us provide you with a better service. That's why we have put a policy in place to protect your personal information. Below is a summary of our policy.</p> 

<p>By submitting personal data manually or in electronic form to this web site, or by using this site, you give your consent that all personal data you submit may be processed in the manner and for the purposes described below.</p> 

<p><strong>What personal information do we collect?</strong>
<br> When making a purchase with EasyHosty, we will collect your contact information, which includes name, address, email address and phone number, as well as payment information. When you become a EasyHosty customer you automatically subscribe to electronic newsletter and special offer promotions. You can adjust your email preferences and/or unsubscribe from certain communications via the client area.</p> 

<p><strong>Protecting your privacy</strong>
<br> We will take appropriate steps to protect your privacy. Whenever you provide sensitive information (for example, a credit card number to make a purchase), we will take all reasonable steps to protect it, such as encrypting your card number. We will also take reasonable security measures to protect your personal information in storage. Credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and are not retained for marketing purposes.</p> 

<p> EasyHosty may provide links to third party sites. Since we do not control those websites, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third party sites.</p> 

<p><strong>Use of cookies</strong>
<br> EasyHosty uses cookies for various reasons, for example, cookies enable us to track information during the domain name registration and package sign-up process. These cookies do not track individual information. Cookies from EasyHosty can only be read by EasyHosty.

<li>the type of browser (Internet Explorer or Netscape) and operating system (Windows, UNIX) you use</li> 
<li>the date and time of your visit</li> 
<li>the pages you visit</li> 
<li>the address of the web site from which you linked to us (if applicable).</li> 
</ul> 

<p>We use this information to make each visit more rewarding, and to provide us with information to help improve our service. We do not know (and do not want to know) the identities of people who visit us in this way.</p> 

<p><strong>Data storage in the U.K.</strong>
<br> Any information that EasyHosty needs to store and process will be carried out on databases located in the UK, and in full compliance of the Data Protection Act.</p> 

<p><strong>How can you update the personal information you have provided to us?</strong>
<br> You can help EasyHosty maintain the accuracy of your information by notifying EasyHosty of any changes to your address, title, phone number or e-mail address. You can do this by updating your personal details from within the client area..</p> 

<p>The personal information we collect and maintain will be subject to the version of the Privacy Policy in effect at the time of collection. We reserve the right to change the Privacy Policy from time to time and will provide notice of these changes on the Privacy Policy pages of our web site. You should make sure you periodically review the Privacy Policy to make sure it meets your needs.</p> 

<p><strong>Personal and account information</strong>
<br> EasyHosty will not otherwise disclose its customers personal and account information unless EasyHosty has reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, make contact with, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing harm or interfering with the rights or property of EasyHosty, EasyHosty 's' customers, or others, or where EasyHosty has a good faith belief that the law requires such disclosure. </p> 

<p><strong>Electronic communications</strong>
<br> EasyHosty also will not, except for reasons stated below, disclose to third parties the contents of any electronic mail or other electronic communications that EasyHosty stores or transmits for its customers.

<ul> 
<li>it is necessary in order to provide service to the customer;</li> 
<li>it is necessary to protect the legitimate interests of EasyHosty and its customers;</li> 
<li>it is required to cooperate with dispute policies, court orders, warrants, or other legal processes that EasyHosty determines in its sole discretion to be valid and enforceable</li> 
<li>it is necessary to provide to a law enforcement agency when the contents are inadvertently obtained by EasyHosty and appear to pertain to the commission of a crime.</li> 
</ul> 

<p> EasyHosty disclaims any intention to censor, edit or engage in ongoing review or surveillance of communications stored on or transmitted through its facilities by customers or others. EasyHosty will, however, review, delete or block access to communications that may harm EasyHosty, its customers or third parties or otherwise infringe the rights of third parties.
