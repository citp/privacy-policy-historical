This privacy statement provides notice of our information collection practices and of the ways in which your information may be used. This policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically to review this information.

**A. Personally-Identifiable Information:**  
EasyMoneyMachines.com typically receives specific data about its website visitors only when such information is provided voluntarily, such as when our visitors request information, purchase or enroll for services, open a customer support inquiry ticket, provide resume information for employment opportunities, or send us e-mail. Of course, some of these activities require that you give us information, such as when you make a purchase, use a credit card to pay for services, submit your resume, or request certain types of information. When you provide personally- identifiable information to EasyMoneyMachines.com through one of our websites, it will be used to fulfill your specific request. In most cases, you will be given the opportunity to select whether you do, or do not, want EasyMoneyMachines.com to use this information for additional purposes. You may also request that EasyMoneyMachines.com not use your information by sending an e-mail to [support@easymoneymachines.com](mailto:support@easymoneymachines.com) , however, EasyMoneyMachines.com reserves the right, in its discretion, to send you bulletins and other important information about your EasyMoneyMachines.com services.

On those sites where you voluntarily offer any feedback, data, answers, questions, comments, suggestions, ideas or the like, EasyMoneyMachines.com will treat that portion of the information as non-confidential and nonproprietary and, except as otherwise expressed in this privacy statement, EasyMoneyMachines.com assumes no obligation to protect such information from disclosure.

EasyMoneyMachines.com gathers this information for the limited purpose of determining customer service and website needs. We accomplish this by using certain technologies, including "cookies" (a technology that can be used to provide the visitor with tailored information about EasyMoneyMachines.com services). EasyMoneyMachines.com does not combine information collected in this way with any personally-identifiable information. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie and you can refuse it.
