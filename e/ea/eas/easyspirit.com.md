**What information does Easy Spirit collect?**

Easy Spirit collects data that you provide to our sales associates in our company-owned Easy Spirit stores and outlets; or on easyspirit.com either through transactions, email registration, sweepstakes, contests, or online membership; or through phone, mail and fax interactions or paper registrations that you submit.

This includes information such as your name, mailing address, email address, phone number, any personal preferences you choose to provide, transaction details such as style, size, price, discount, date, store, your credit card number and expiration date used for transactions, and an encrypted password to ensure maximum protection of your privacy.

Easy Spirit occasionally obtains email addresses of active Easy Spirit store customers who requested fashion emails on other websites. Easy Spirit also reserves the right to obtain publicly accessible customer demographics.

**How does Easy Spirit use this information?**

Easy Spirit does not sell, rent or trade with third parties any personal information you provide to us online or at our Easy Spirit stores.

Easy Spirit uses this information to confirm and process sales transactions or to contact you with questions or communications about your order, or to respond to your customer service inquiries.

Easy Spirit also uses this information to enhance and personalize your shopping experience, both online and in our stores, and to communicate with you for marketing and promotional purposes via targeted postal pieces, phone messages, or personalized emails. You may indicate your contact preferences regarding promotional communications either directly to us online or to customer service representatives or to the sales associates in our stores.

**How can you access your information?**

You may access and edit the information that you provide online when you authenticate your right to access by signing in at easyspirit.com. Simply click on "[Sign In](https://www.easyspirit.com/s;ES_JSESSIONID=ESgJLeSbPfL1bAUi3B2QZXifyiiUEpwXyX5h9XXLwVJAVsOpkS25!2047664827?namespace=profile&origin=security.jsp&event=Login)" link from the home page and enter your email address and password to access your information. You can request password help at any time by clicking on the "[don't have a password?](https://www.easyspirit.com/s;ES_JSESSIONID=ESgJLeSbPfL1bAUi3B2QZXifyiiUEpwXyX5h9XXLwVJAVsOpkS25!2047664827?namespace=profile&origin=security.jsp&event=Login)" link at which time easyspirit.com will email an encrypted password to the associated email address.

Currently, we do not provide online access to information that you provided to Easy Spirit offline. But at any time you may request access to your information from our customer service representatives or our store associates.

To alleviate any concern on your part, easyspirit.com does not store or provide access to credit card information, which is why you will be required to re-enter your credit card and expiration date with every online credit card transaction.

**How does Easy Spirit protect your information?**

All information input by you and transmitted to our website when you place an order or provide personal information is protected by password and by an encryption using Secure Socket Layer Technology ("SSL"). SSL encrypts your order and personal information before it is transmitted to us to avoid the decoding of your information by anyone other than Easy Spirit.

**Does Easy Spirit disclose your information to others?**

Easy Spirit and Jones Apparel Group does not sell, rent or trade with third parties any personal information you provide to us online or at our stores, nor do we share such information with third parties except for the express purpose of assisting us in fulfilling your transactions and customer service inquiries, updating your customer information record in our database, deploying our promotional offers to you, or fulfilling your request to [unsubscribe](http://www.easyspirit.com/s;ES_JSESSIONID=ESgJLeSbPfL1bAUi3B2QZXifyiiUEpwXyX5h9XXLwVJAVsOpkS25!2047664827?namespace=profile&origin=security.jsp&event=NewsLetterUnsub) from our email. We do not authorize those third parties to make any other use of your information.

Jones Apparel Group, Inc. is the parent company for Easy Spirit. Jones Apparel Group maintains a single database of customer information for several brands owned by the [Jones Apparel Group](http://www.jny.com/) family of companies, including [Nine West](http://www.ninewest.com/), [Bandolino](http://www.bandolino.com/), [Kasper](http://www.kasper.com/), [Anne Klein](http://www.anneklein.com/) and [Jones New York](http://www.jonesnewyork.com/) brands. For each customer in this database, Jones Apparel Group maintains a separate set of contact preferences for each brand to which that customer has provided her customer information. When you establish or update your customer profile information with one of the Jones Apparel Group brands, whether through a purchase, registration or email sign-up at a company-owned or operated website, specialty store or outlet store for one of the Jones Apparel Group brands, through a customer service representative, or in any other communication you may have with us, we will update your customer record on the Jones Apparel Group database. This does not in any way authorize use of your information by the other Jones Apparel Group brands for any other purpose, including marketing and promotional purposes.

**How does Easy Spirit protect a child's privacy?**

In keeping with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, Easy Spirit will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from any person under the age of 13, without first seeking prior verifiable parental consent. If we become aware that a user of our website is under the age of 13 and has provided an online registration without prior verifiable parental consent, we will remove that child's personal information from our files.
