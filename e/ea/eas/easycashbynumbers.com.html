<p><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Last Updated: 09/07/2010</span></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">EasyCashByNumbers.com strives to offer its visitors the many
advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience. We may use Personally
Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. We will never
sell, barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized third party. Ever."</span></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">How we gather information from users</span></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">How we collect and store information depends on the page you
are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. For example, you may be
asked to provide information when you register for access to certain portions of our site or request certain
features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may provide information when you participate in
interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites,</span></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">EasyCashByNumbers.com also collects information automatically
and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name
of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit.
Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that
information each time you visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while
visiting our site. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for example by setting your
browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may
be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to customize the site’s features according
to your preferences.</span></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">What we do with the information we collect</span></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance
your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy and do not share your
information with anyone.</span></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Aggregated Information (information that does not personally
identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your usage patterns with
similar information obtained from other users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are
visited most or what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our
advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does not include any Personally Identifiable Information
about you or allow anyone to identify you individually.</span></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on
EasyCashByNumbers.com to communicate with you about your registration and customization preferences, our Terms of
Service and privacy policy, services and products offered by EasyCashByNumbers.com and other topics we think you
might find of interest.</span></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Personally Identifiable Information collected by
EasyCashByNumbers.com may also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site administration,
troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, and other communications with you. Certain third parties
who provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such
information. We will use your information only as permitted by law. We may also disclose your information in
response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection
with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it
appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such
cases.</span></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Affiliated sites, linked sites and
advertisements</span></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">EasyCashByNumbers.com expects its partners, advertisers and
affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties, including our partners,
advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and
data collection policies and practices. For example, during your visit to our site you may link to certain content
that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, through EasyCashByNumbers.com you may be introduced to,
or be able to access, information, Web sites, features offered by other parties. EasyCashByNumbers.com is not
responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of
those third parties when providing information on a feature or page operated by a third
party.</span></font></p><br>

<p><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose
Personally Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that information can be viewed publicly and
can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other
individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of EasyCashByNumbers.com and this
policy.</span></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Children</span></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">EasyCashByNumbers.com does not knowingly collect or solicit
Personally Identifiable Information from or about children under 13 except as permitted by law. If we discover we
have received any information from a child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information
immediately. If you believe EasyCashByNumbers.com has any information from or about anyone under 13, please contact
us</span><font size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">.</span></font></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Changes to this Policy</span></font></p>

at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of our site following the posting
of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes. Information collected prior to the time any change is
posted will be used according to the rules and laws that applied at the time the information was
collected.</span></font></p>
