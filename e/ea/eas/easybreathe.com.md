### What information is collected?

We collect two types of information: Identifying Information and Non-Identifying Information. 

_Types of Identifying Information we collect:_ When you create an account, make a purchase, or when you enter information on this Site, we may collect personal information from you including your: 

  * First and Last name
  * Email address
  * Phone and Fax numbers
  * Billing and Shipping addresses
  * Date of Birth
  * Order History
  * Account Name and Password
  * Health Insurance Account Information (if needed)
  * Medical Prescription (if needed)
  * Medical Records (if needed)



_A Note Regarding Your Sensitive Medical Information:_ To receive your health insurance benefits, we must file a claim with your insurance provider. Some of the items we sell are only available with a valid prescription. As such, we are a covered entity and subject to the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). If you choose to have us submit your claim through insurance, we will collect your health insurance account information, medical prescription, and medical records if necessary. This can be obtained through your doctor’s office. In some circumstances, you may also be able to upload your records. Please note, only customers choosing to utilize their health insurance benefits and/or purchase a prescription-only item will have to submit this sensitive medical information. **Either way, rest assured, we are HIPAA compliant.**

_Types of Non-Identifying Information We Collect:_ We may also collect general information resulting from your activity on the Site, including your preferences and other tendencies. This may include anonymous “traffic data” or tracking information provided by the website’s host or similar provider of such information (i.e., Google Analytics and Hotjar) that does not personally identify you, but may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer. Analytics is the process of collecting, analyzing, and reporting aggregate data. This information may include which pages visitors visit, how long visitors may stay on a particular page, and where visitors are located. It may also provide information about what browser, network, or device is used to visit our Site. To learn more about Google Analytics and how to opt out, please visit their [Privacy Policy](https://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html). To learn more about Hotjar and how to opt out, please visit [their page](https://www.hotjar.com/opt-out). 

In addition, when you visit our Site, we may also log your anonymous IP addresses, a unique identifier for your computer or other access device. This helps us diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Site, or to display the content according to your preferences. 

_We Also Use Cookies and Web Beacons:_ A cookie is a small string of information that the website you visit transfers to your computer for identification purposes. Cookies can be used to follow your activity on the website and that information helps websites to understand your preferences and improve your website experience. Cookies are also used for such activities as remembering your user name and password, if you use such a feature on this Site. You can turn off all cookies in the event you prefer not to receive them. You can also have your computer warn you whenever cookies are being used. There are also software products available that can manage cookies for you. Please be aware, however, that when you choose to reject cookies, this choice may limit the functionality of the website and you may lose access to some of its features. 

A web beacon is an invisible pixel-sized graphic image on a web page, web-based document or e-mail message. It helps us do things like view the URL of the page on which the beacon appears and the time the Site, document or email in question is viewed. They can be used to confirm the receipt of, and response to, our emails, including those that you forward to friends and family; and they help deliver a more personalized online experience.

### How does easybreathe.com verify insurance coverage?

The Check Your Insurance link opens a Typeform that collects your insurance information. This feature is optional. You can also fill out the “Check Your Insurance Coverage Today” form. These forms collect you first and last name, email address, phone number, zip code, and insurance carrier.  You may be given the choice to complete your sign-up online, which prompts you to enter your Insurance Member ID and date of birth, or submit the form immediately, in which case you will be called to obtain that information. 

Once we have your complete insurance information, it is verified by one of our team members. You will then receive an email and/or phone call letting you know that we have your coverage information and are ready to discuss it with you. If we do not receive a response, we may send your basic coverage summary to you via email.
