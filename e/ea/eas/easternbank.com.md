What we do  
---  
**How does Eastern protect my personal information?** | 

To protect your personal information from unauthorized access and use, we use security measures that comply with federal law. These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings.

We will safeguard any information you share with us. In addition, we will limit the collection and use of nonpublic personal information to the minimum required to provide you with superior products or services. We restrict access to your personal account information to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal and state standards to guard your nonpublic personal information.  
  
**How does Eastern collect my personal information?** | 

We collect your personal information, for example, when you

  * Open an account or deposit money
  * Pay your bills or apply for a loan
  * Use your credit or debit card



We also collect your personal information from others, such as credit bureaus and/or affiliates.  
  
**Why can't I limit all sharing?** | 

Federal law gives you the right to limit only

  * Sharing for affiliates’ everyday business purposes—information about your creditworthiness
  * Affiliates from using your information to market to you
  * Sharing for nonaffiliates to market to you



State laws and individual companies may give you additional rights to limit sharing.  
  
**What happens when I limit sharing for an account I hold jointly with someone else?** | An opt-out direction from you will apply to all of the associated account holders for the account numbers you have listed on the Opt Out Form.
