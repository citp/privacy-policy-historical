## SECURITY STATEMENT

We are committed to protecting the privacy and security of the information that you provide to Eason. We have put in place multiple technical and physical security measures in place to prevent any loss of security to your information. The collection, transmission and storage of information can never be guaranteed to be completely secure, however, we have taken steps to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your information.

Our website is fully compliant with the requirements set out in the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards version 2.0 (PCI DSS 2.0). We do not hold special category or sensitive payment data when users interact with our site.

Secure Sockets Layer, or 'SSL', is the security technology used by Eason for encrypting a link between a web server and a browser. All data passed between our web server and your browser remains completely private and secure. For example, using SSL, your computer and ours agree to transpose whatever we are sending into an unintelligible hash of characters.

Through using SSL, we can ensure that your valuable personal data is fully encrypted when you interact with our site. Without this information on your computer or ours, no one can understand our encrypted communication.

Our SSL certificates are issued by a leading certificate authority, Symantec. Symantec TM is the world’s leading provider of SSL certificates. Symantec helped lead the development of Extended Validation (EV) and has issued more EV SSL certificates than any other Certificate Authority.

Our marketing activities, through Eason newsletters, social, loyalty communications, contain genuine, valid money saving offers and promotions that may be active on Eason for a defined period of time. Spam, or content of a poor quality is never distributed to our subscribers. By notifying you of these offers, we always aim to do so in a non-intrusive, high quality manner.

To subscribe to the direct marketing from Eason, you must explicitly consent to do by either populating our sign up form on our website, or by updating your subscription preferences in either your Eason Account Summary or while completing a purchase at the Eason checkout. You will never receive our marketing communications unless you have explicitly provided your consent to Eason.
