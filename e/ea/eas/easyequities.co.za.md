addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Easy Equities Website, the information you previously provided can

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually
modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully
experience the interactive features of the Easy Equities services or Websites you visit.
