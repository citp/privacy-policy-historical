# Privacy and Copyright - EasySendy Pro

**Website Visitors**

Like most website operators, EasySendy collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. EasySendy’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how EasySendy’s visitors use its website. From time to time, EasySendy may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

EasySendy also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on EasySendy’s blogs. EasySendy only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.

Any personal information which is collected by EasySendy will be used by us only in accordance with current data protection legislation

 **Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information**

Certain visitors to EasySendy’s websites choose to interact with EasySendy in ways that require EasySendy to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that EasySendy gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for Sendy hosting services at EasySendy.com to provide an email address. Those who engage in transactions with EasySendy – by purchasing access to the Amazon SES service, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, EasySendy collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with EasySendy. EasySendy does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

 **Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information**

EasySendy discloses potential personally-identifying information only to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on EasySendy’s behalf or to provide services available at EasySendy’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using EasySendy’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. EasySendy will not rent or sell potential personally-identifying information to anyone, other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations as described above. EasySendy discloses potential personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when EasySendy believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of EasySendy, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an EasySendy website and have supplied your email address, EasySendy may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with EasySendy and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. EasySendy takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
