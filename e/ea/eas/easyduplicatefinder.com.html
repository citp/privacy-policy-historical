	<h4>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h4>
	<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
	<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s  computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not  link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable  information you submit while on our site.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>We use both session ID cookies &amp; persistent  cookies.&nbsp; We use session cookies to make  it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you  close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an  extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following  directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file. </p>
	<p>We set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you  don’t have to enter it more than once.&nbsp;  Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of  our users to enhance the experience on our site.&nbsp; <br>
		If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your  ability to use some areas of our site, such as contests or surveys, will be  limited. </p>
	<p><strong>Tracking Technologies &amp; Third Party Cookies</strong></p>
	<p>The use of cookies by our partners &amp; affiliates is not  covered by our privacy statement.&nbsp; We /do  not have access or control over these cookies.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>We use Google Analytics, a third-party tracking service,  which uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about our  visitors to our site in the aggregate to capture usage and volume statistics.  Some of our business partners (e.g., Google Analytics) use cookies on our site.  We have no access to or control over these cookies. </p>
	<h4>Web beacons </h4>
	<p>Our Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web  beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to  compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our site is used and may be used  in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by  recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer  communications and marketing campaigns.<br>
		We use a third party to gather information about how you and  others use our Web site. For example, we will know how many users access a  specific page and which links they clicked on. We use this aggregated  information to understand and optimize how our site is used.</p>
	<h4>Links to Other Web Sites </h4>

No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of  electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its  absolute security.</p>

The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are  kept in a secure environment. </p>
