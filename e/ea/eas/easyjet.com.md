Use of Customer Information** We require certain information to allow us to process your flight booking. easyJet collects the details provided by you, together with information we learn about you from your use of our service and your visits to our web site and other sites accessible from them. We also collect information about the transactions you undertake including details of payment cards used. 

We may collect additional information in connection with your participation in any promotions or competitions offered by us and information you provide when giving us feedback. 

We will use your information to provide and personalise our service. We will also use your contact details to communicate with you. We may use your information to send you offers and news about easyJet products and services or those of other carefully selected companies which we think may be of interest to you. We may contact you by post, email, telephone (including SMS) or fax for these purposes. Your confirmation e-mails (which may include details of flight bookings or other services booked through our websites) may include marketing material which we may feel will be of interest to you from other third parties. 

Your data may be used for the following purposes: accounting, billing and audit, credit or other payment card verification and screening, immigration and customs control, safety, security, health, administrative and legal purposes, statistical and marketing analysis, systems testing, maintenance and development, customer surveys, customer relations and to help us in any future dealings with you, for example by identifying your requirements and preferences. 

Once you have registered with easyJet.com, you will be provided with access to a "Contact Preferences" page that will allow you to tailor our commercial communications to your preferences. You can opt-out of receiving e-mail updates at any time by going to [My easyJet.com](https://www.easyjet.com/EN/secure/MyEasyJet.mvc/SignIn).

We like to receive feedback from our customers to help us improve our service. We may contact you by post, e-mail, telephone or fax to ask your opinions. 

Please note there may be instances where it may be necessary for us to communicate with you for administrative or operational reasons relating, for example, to advise you of alterations to flights. 

We may also use and analyse the information that we collect so that we can administer, support, improve and develop our business. 

The information that you provide to us will be held in our systems, which are located on our premises or those of an appointed third party. We may also allow access to your information by other third parties who act for us for the purposes set out in this policy or for other purposes approved by you. It is possible that your data may be processed outside of Europe. 

**2\. Site tracking** We use tracking software to monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop the design and layout of the site to better meet the needs of visitors to easyJet.com. This software does not enable us to capture any personally identifying information.

Furthermore, as required by the UK Data Protection Acts of 1984 and 1998, we follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information which you have given us, to prevent unauthorised access. Our security procedures mean that we may request proof of identity before we are able to disclose sensitive information to you. 

In the circumstances set out in this policy where easyJet passes your information to a third party, we will ensure that the security measures that such party has in place in relation to the processing of your data are at least as stringent as those employed by easyJet. This does not apply where we are required by law to pass your information to a third party. 

We will retain your information for a reasonable period or as long as the law requires.
