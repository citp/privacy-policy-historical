# Privacy Policy

Eastman respects the privacy of visitors to our website and is committed to maintaining all reasonable precautions to assure the privacy and security of this website. Please read the following policy carefully, because it explains what information we collect from website visitors, why we collect it, and where the information goes.

**Information Collection and Use**  
Generally, you may visit our website without telling us any information about yourself, including your email address. Our web servers may collect the name of the domain that you used to access the Internet and the websites that you visited directly before and after visiting our website. If we collect this information, we aggregate it to learn measurements such as the most popular pages viewed at our website, the average number of visits to the website, and the average time spent at the site.

In order to visit some areas of our website or to receive some services, we may ask you to register at our site or to otherwise provide information about yourself or your company in order to better serve you. This information may include information about you and your company such as your name, title, company, address, telephone number, email address, interests and other similar types of information. We store this information in the United States and we use it for these general purposes: to fulfill your requests for products and services, to improve our services, to contact you, and to conduct research.

In addition, certain on-line technical applications require the entry of technical data such as product formulations or properties. Eastman does not monitor nor save such information to storage devices unless the application provides for the storage of such information as a service to you. In that case, such information will not be accessed or viewed by Eastman personnel except for those activities required for the maintenance and upkeep of our website. We will take all reasonable precautions to assure that no such information will be provided or divulged to other third party personnel.

We may also make use of website "cookies" to help you use our services more easily and to help us continuously improve our website and our service to you. A "cookie" is a small data file that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive to help our website "remember" information about you when you return to our website, such as your preferences for our website or account id's. Our cookies cannot read data off of your hard drive, read cookie files created by other websites or track any personal information about you. You may be able to set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie.

Our website may contain "links" to other sites, and we cannot and are not responsible for maintaining your privacy once you leave our site. We attempt to only link to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy.

**Security**  
Eastman takes reasonable precautions to keep all information obtained from our online visitors secure against unauthorized access and use and we periodically review our security measures in an effort to ensure your privacy. We will not, without your permission, give, sell or provide to others for a fee any information that you provide to us, except as set forth herein. We will always ask for and obtain your permission before sharing your information with anyone other than Eastman Chemical Company subsidiaries and affiliates, unless we believe in good faith that the law requires our Company to do so.

If you wish to verify any voluntary information collected about you, or if you wish to be removed from our site database, please contact us at [ebushelp@eastman.com](mailto:ebushelp@eastman.com).
