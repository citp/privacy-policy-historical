# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy applies to all information gathering activities of EasyGoodHealth, on and offline. The policy describes how we handle information provided to us or collected on Internet sites where this privacy policy is posted. It also explains how we handle information provided to us or collected on applications we make available on or through third-party sites or platforms, if it is disclosed to you in connection with your use, purchase or download of the application.

**Children Under 13**  
We care about the safety of children. We won’t knowingly allow anyone under 13 to provide us any personal identifying information. Children should always get permission from their parents before sending any information about themselves (such as, their names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers) over the Internet to us or to anyone else. We encourage you to become involved in your children’s online experience and to share your interest in our sites with your young ones.

**Information Collection**  
EasyGoodHealth collects personal identifying information (“PII”) from you when you visit our website(s), through e-mail, and through the use of our mobile applications. We also collect PII during transactions, sponsored events and contests/sweepstakes. PII includes your name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone and cell phone numbers, wireless service provider, and all other information that identifies you.

We may collect information about your interaction with EasyGoodHealth sites, applications and services. For example, we may use website analytics tools on our site to retrieve information from your browser, including the site you came from, the search engine(s) and the keywords you used to find our site, the pages you view within our site, your browser add-ons, and your browser’s width and height. We may also use technologies, such as cookies and web beacons (described below), to collect information about the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on our sites and services. Additionally, we may collect certain standard information that your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring website addresses.

When you receive newsletters or promotional e-mail from EasyGoodHealth, we may use web beacons (described below), customized links or similar technologies to determine whether the e-mail has been opened and which links you click in order to provide you more focused e-mail communications or other information.

In order to offer you a more consistent and personalized experience in your interactions with EasyGoodHealth, information collected through one EasyGoodHealth site, application or service may be combined with information obtained through other EasyGoodHealth sites, applications or services. We may also supplement the information we collect with information obtained from other companies.

**How We Use Your Information**  
The information we collect allows us to customize the content and/or layout of our sites and applications for you and each other visitor. Plus, it enables us to notify you about updates to our websites and applications, contact you with special offers of interest, and customize your experience.

In addition, EasyGoodHealth may make certain PII and other information available to trusted third parties that work with us to provide products and services to our customers, that help us with marketing campaigns, or that intend to market products and services to you directly. These companies are obligated to protect the information they receive.

**Transfers of Information for Legal Purposes**  
EasyGoodHealth may need to disclose certain information to comply with a legal requirement, such as a law, regulation, court order, subpoena, or search warrant, in the course of a legal proceeding or in response to a law enforcement agency request. If there is a change of control in EasyGoodHealth’s business (whether by merger, sale, or otherwise) or a sale or transfer of its assets, your information could be sold or transferred as part of that transaction and your PII and other information potentially used by the Purchaser or other recipient of said information.

You acknowledge that EasyGoodHealth is located in the United States of America (“U.S.”) and will process and store your information in the U.S., and that as a result, U.S. governments, courts or law enforcement or regulatory agencies may be able to obtain disclosure of your information through the laws of the U.S.

**Mobile Devices/Third Party Fees**  
From time to time, EasyGoodHealth may make mobile device application and mobile marketing campaigns available to you and may allow you to register for services that involve messages and/or e-mails being sent to your mobile device. You are responsible for obtaining access to the mobile device services and that access may involve third-party fees, including mobile carrier, text messaging, or airtime charges. You are solely responsible for those fees, including any and all fees associated with the use of the applications, delivery of the messages, e-mails or other materials to your mobile device. Please consult your mobile service provider’s pricing plan prior to purchasing or downloading any application or registering for any such service to determine the charges for sending and receiving text messages from/to your mobile device. You will be given the opportunity to opt-out of receiving text messages or emails to your mobile device at the time you register and with each message or email you receive.

Mobile marketing campaigns may involve your sending an e-mail from your mobile device to EasyGoodHealth or a third-party campaign operator. An e-mail or other response will then be sent to your mobile device. Opting to participate in a campaign is 100% your choice. When you engage in these mobile marketing campaigns, EasyGoodHealth and the third-party campaign operator may collect your cell phone number, the name of your wireless service provider, images that you send using your cell phone as part of the campaign, and other relevant information.

What are “Cookies” and “Web Beacons” and what do they do for me?  
In order to provide better service when you return to our site, EasyGoodHealth may use Cookies and Web Beacons to store your preferences and information about such things as items added to your shopping cart, purchases you have made with us, what pages you visit, and past activity at a site. EasyGoodHealth may also employ Web Beacons from third parties in order to help us compile aggregated statistics regarding the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or other operations of our sites.

“Cookies” are tiny pieces of information stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies are also used to ensure that you are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads and to customize webpage content based on your browser type (Netscape or Microsoft Explorer, for example). Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies.

Web Beacons – sometimes called single-pixel gifs or clear gifs – are used to assist in delivering cookies on our sites and allow us to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. We may include Web Beacons in promotional e-mail messages or our newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.

If you want to disable cookies, there is a simple procedure in most Internet browsers that allows you to turn off cookies. Please remember, however, that cookies may be required to allow you to use certain features of our sites.

**Third Party Advertising**  
We may use third-party advertising, data analytics and online targeting companies to serve ads when you visit our sites or use our applications. We may also provide certain PII and other information to these third-parties to allow them to more effectively target advertising to you. These companies are obligated to protect your information, but you may opt-out of this sharing through the process described here.

When advertisements are displayed to you on our sites and applications, one or more persistent cookies may be placed on your computer or device by us or a third party. Some of these third parties may use information (including PII) about your visits to this site and other websites and usage of applications in order to provide data and targeting recommendations based on which you may receive advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. To learn more about this practice and the third-party companies we may currently be using, click here. To opt out of this practice, please click here.

**Links**  
EasyGoodHealthsites may, on occasion, contain links to other sites with information gathering practices different from our own. Visitors should consult privacy policies for all other sites, as EasyGoodHealth has no control over information submitted to or collected by such third parties.

EasyGoodHealth sites sometimes offer contests, sweepstakes, or promotions sponsored or co-sponsored by third parties. These third parties may obtain PII that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the contest, sweepstakes, or promotion. EasyGoodHealth has no control over the third-party sponsor’s use of this information. The EasyGoodHealth site will notify you at the time of requesting PII if third-party sponsors will be provided with such information.

**Changes to the Privacy Policy**  
EasyGoodHealth may need to change this privacy policy from time to time in order to address new issues, evolving technologies, changes on our sites, or business practices. EasyGoodHealth will post those changes so you will always know what information we gather and how we might use that information. Please refer back to this policy regularly.

**What about data security?**  
To ensure the security of your data – including address information and credit card numbers – EasyGoodHealth always uses industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving consumer data exchanged with our site. We have appropriate security measures that protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information that we have collected from you.
