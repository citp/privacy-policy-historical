Privacy in EasyChair

This web page describes how we use your personal and conference data.

We collect data that is normally required by conference organizers. This is your name, email address, address for correspondence, Web page, country, affiliation, or phone number.

We do not pass any personal cross-conference data. For example, when you submit a paper, we will not pass information on whether this or a similar paper has been submitted before or in parallel. We will never pass any information about reviewing in one conference to organizers of another conference, even if both are different instances of the same conference series.

Note, however, that we cannot prevent conference organizers from passing this information.

This section covers our policy on handling your data for uses other than the use by conference organizers as described in Sections 1 and 2\. Exceptions to this policy are described in Section 5.

  1. We do not sell, distribute, or pass your personal data to any organization.
  2. We do not access data of any conference that uses EasyChair. Our policy is that _the only persons who have access to this data are those persons who have access to it as a consequence of their use of EasyChair_. For example, if we store a review on a submission for a conference, only the following people will have access to this review:
    1. the reviewer who wrote the review;
    2. the chairs of the conference;
    3. the program committee member who is handling the review;
    4. all program committee members to which the chairs give access to the review;
    5. the authors of the submission if the chairs decide to send the review to the authors, and only after the review has been sent to the authors.



For nearly all services provided by EasyChair data controllers are our users: conferences, reviewers, authors and registrants. The exceptions are EasyChair services related to publishing (publications, EasyChair Preprints and Smart CFP), where you give us an explicit consent to publish.

The following information is collected by or on behalf of EasyChair and is necessary for providing our services:

  1. Account data: we collect information when you create or update your EasyChair account. This include your name, email, organization, country, login name and password (which is stored encrypted). You can also optionally provide your address and phone number.
  2. When you make payments through EasyChair, payment information and history to the extent allowed by PCI security standards (for example, we do not store credit card numbers).
  3. When you use our publishing services, information about authors, editors, managers and the published content.
  4. We may collect information about IP addresses you use to access our services.
  5. We may collect information about how you interact with our services. This includes information such as access dates and times and published information you access. In some cases, we collect this information through cookies.
  6. We store the list of your co-authors and co-reviewers (associates). This list can be edited by you.
  7. We store the history of your customer support requests.
  8. We store the list of conferences you manage and your roles in these conferences.



The EasyChair Web Site uses cookies. A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we put on your computer if you agree. These cookies allow us to distinguish you from other users of the EasyChair Web Site, which helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse the EasyChair Web Site and also allows us to improve the EasyChair Web Site.

The use of cookies is necessary for secure user authentication. We only use secure cookies.

We do not use third party cookies on our Web pages and thus do not allow third party services to collect information about your use of EasyChair.

We reserve a right to interfere in conference management or access personal or conference information in the following cases:

  1. We have reports on a substantial abuse of EasyChair, for example (a) its use for sending unsolicited email not related to the intended use or (b) use of the EasyChair submission facilities for anything different from its intended use by conference organizers.
  2. Our security features report on attacks on EasyChair or on repeated attempts to access data in unauthorized ways



In any such case of reported abuse our interference in conference management or personal information will only be exercised to the extent required to investigate the problem.
