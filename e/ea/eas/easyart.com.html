		<h3>What Information Do We Collect?</h3>
		<p>We may collect and process the following data items related to you:</p>
		<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Information that you provide by filling in forms on our site www.easyart.com (our site). This includes information provided at the time of registering to use our site, subscribing to our service, posting material or requesting further services. We may also ask you for information when you report a problem with our site.</li>
			<li>If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence.</li>
			<li>Easyart may also ask you to complete surveys that we use for research purposes, although you do not have to respond to them.</li>
			<li>Details of transactions you carry out through our site and of the fulfilment of your orders.</li>
			<li>Details of your visits to our site including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data, whether this is required for our own billing purposes or otherwise and the resources that you access.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h3>How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?</h3>
		<p>We use information held about you in the following ways:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>To ensure that content from our site is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer.</li>
			<li>To provide you with information, products or services that you request from us or which we feel may interest you, where you have consented to be contacted for such purposes.</li>

			<li>To allow you to participate in interactive features of our service, when you choose to do so.</li>
			<li>To notify you about changes to our service.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>If you are an existing customer, we will only contact you by electronic means (e-mail or SMS) with information about goods and services similar to those which were the subject of a previous sale to you.</p> 
		
		<p>If you do not want us to use your data in this way, please opt-out as directed below.</p>
		
		<h3>IP Addresses/Cookies</h3>
		<p>We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and our own analytical purposes. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.</p>
		
		<p>A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, that site's computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each Web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a Web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.</p>
		
		<h3>How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?</h3>
		<p>As you visit our Web site, the site uses its cookies to differentiate you from other customers. In some cases, we also use cookies to prevent you from seeing unnecessary advertisements or requiring you to log in more than is necessary for security.</p>
		
		<p>Cookies, in conjunction with our Web server's log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our Web site and which parts of the site are most popular. This helps us gather feedback in order to constantly improve our Web site and better serve our customers. Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal information about you and we do not generally store any personal information that you provided to us in your cookies.</p>
		
		<h2>Personal Information You Choose to Provide</h2>
		<h3>Registration Information</h3>
		<p>You will provide us information about yourself, your firm or company, and your practices when you register to be a user of our services, register for certain services, or register for email newsletters and alerts.</p>
		
		<h3>Email Information</h3>
		<p>If you choose to correspond with us through email, we may retain the content of your email messages together with your email address and our responses. If you use our "Email this page" feature to send a copy of that page to someone else, your email address will appear as the sender of the email. Both your email address and the recipient's email address will not be used for any other purpose.</p>
		
		<h3>Disclosure of your information</h3>
		<p>We may disclose your personal information to any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006.</p>
		
		<h3>We may disclose your personal information to third parties:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets.
			</li>
			<li>
				If Easyart Limited or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets.
			</li>
			<li>
				If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms of use or <a href="/content/help/terms_and_conditions.ghtml">terms and conditions of supply</a> and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Easyart Limited, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Choice/Opt-out</h3>
		<p>If you do not wish to receive any promotional or marketing e-mails and/or surface mail marketing letters, you may opt-out of receiving those communications by using the opt-out mechanism on the User Account Settings Web page, or by sending an e-mail with the subject line "Unsubscribe" to our e-mail address - see above.
</p>		
		<h3>Sharing Information with Third Parties</h3>
		<p>We use third parties to facilitate our business, including, but not limited to, sending email and processing credit card payments. In connection with these business operations, our partners and other third parties may have access to your personal information for use in connection with business activities.</p>
		
		<h2>How Do We Protect Your Information?</h2>
		<h3>Secure Information Transmissions</h3>
		<p>Email is not recognized as a secure medium of communication. For this reason, we request that you do not send private information to us by email. Some of the information you may enter on our Web site may be transmitted securely via Secure Sockets Layer SSL, 256 bit encryption services. Pages utilizing this technology will have URL's that start with HTTPS instead of HTTP. Please contact us on 0845 1662 732 (+44 (0)1273 511 942 Outside UK) if you have any questions or concerns.</p>
		
		<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>
		
		<p>Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</p>
		
		<h3>Your rights</h3>
		<p>You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data.  You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us at <a href="mailto:customercare@easyart.com">customercare@easyart.com</a>.</p>
		
		<p>Our site may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates.  If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies.  Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.</p>
		
		<h3>How Can You Access and Correct Your Information?</h3>
		<p>The Act gives you the right to access information held about you. You may request access to all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain in our database by contacting us (contact information above). Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the Act. Any access request may be subject to a fee of £10 to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you.</p>
		
		<h3>Changes to our privacy policy</h3>
		<p>Any changes we may make to our privacy policy in the future will be posted on this page and, where appropriate, notified to you by e-mail.</p>
		
		<h3>Contact</h3>
		<p>Questions, comments and requests regarding this privacy policy are welcomed and should be addressed to <a href="mailto:customercare@easyart.com">customercare@easyart.com</a>.</p>
