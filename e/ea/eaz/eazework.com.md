### Cookies and Tracking Technology

A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited, but the only Personal Information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Cookies save you time, for example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a website; a cookie recalls your specific information on subsequent visits.

EazeWork website also uses cookies to track user traffic patterns. We do this in order to determine the usefulness of our website information to our users and to see how effective our navigational structure is in helping users reach that information. You may accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, however you can modify your browser setting to decline cookies.

In addition to cookies, our site uses a variety of technical methods for tracking purposes, which may include web beacons. Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of web sites. EazeWork also uses these technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on our web site, such as the frequency with which our users visit various parts of our web site.

### Information Sharing and Disclosure

Only authorized EazeWork employees with complete training in security and privacy processes and under managerial supervision will have access to your Personal Information. Primarily this access is needed to provide customer service and resolve application performance or system issues.

At times EazeWork will use third party vendors and we may need to transfer your Personal Information to them. In all such cases only the relevant information will be transferred to them and they will also be compulsorily required to follow our Privacy and Security Policy. 

We may transfer your Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: 

  1. conform to the edicts of law or comply with legal process served on EazeWork
  2. protect and defend the rights or property of EazeWork, or
  3. act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of EazeWork’s employees, users of EazeWork’s products or services, or members of the public.



### How We Use Information Collected

The information collected is used by us to set up the services for our users and their organizations. In addition, we may also use the information to contact you for discussions regarding our applications or the services we provide, and to send information regarding our company or partners, such as promotions and events. We will also be using the email address to send information regarding updates to the applications and services or company news, and a email newsletter. Additionally, we also ask customers to provide an email address while registering for the services, in order to send a username and password.

You will have the opportunity to opt-in or opt-out of receiving communications from EazeWork when you elect to use our software product on a free-trial basis, or purchase / upgrade an account. Further, when you receive the requested communication, you are given the opportunity to unsubscribe from receiving any future communication or to change your information.

### Data Security

At EazeWork, protection of customer data and applications is of highest priority. We take all precautions to keep your data safe and secure. The platform is hosted at the state of the art data centre, using the latest firewall protection, intrusion detection systems, SSL encryption and proprietary security products and managed by a team of experts to keep customer data stored in a high security facility where even physical access is audited and controlled. All data is regularly backed up to ensure that your data is never lost, even in the worst of calamities. 

EazeWork provides a unique user name and password to each user that must be entered each time a User logs on. A session "cookie" is issued only to record encrypted authentication information for the duration of a specific session. The session "cookie" does not store either the username or password of the user or any other confidential user and session information, but instead implements more advanced security methods based on dynamic data and encoded session IDs. In addition, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology protects your information using both server authentication and data encryption while accessing our site using Google Chrome version 3.0.195.27, Microsoft Internet Explorer version 6.0 or higher, Safari version 4.0.2 and Mozilla Firefox 1.5 or later. 

Questions regarding the security practices of the Services should be emailed to [support@eazework.com](mailto:support@eazework.com).

### Data Backup

We backup data every eight hours and keep it at a different location from the primary data center to provide back and redundancy in case of a failure at the primary location. 

### Changes to this Security and Privacy Policy

EazeWork may amend this policy from time to time, the amended policy will be posted at the same link as it is posted now. It is the responsibility of users to ensure that they periodically visit this link to read the updated policy. If we make any substantial changes in the way we use your Personal Information we will make that information available by posting a notice on [www.eazework.com](https://www.eazework.com/) site.
