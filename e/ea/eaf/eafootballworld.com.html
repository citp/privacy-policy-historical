<h2><span style="color: #003366;"><a name="section2"></a>2. How We Collect Information</span></h2>
We and third parties use technologies described below to collect information to deliver excellent experiences.<br><br>
<ol style="font-weight: bold; color: #003366; list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
<li>Cookies and Similar Technologies<br><br><span style="font-weight: normal; color: #000000;">Cookies are small text files stored on your Internet browser. We use cookies and similar technologies to help us understand things like what web pages, features or ads you view and what games you play. This information helps us keep track of your shopping cart, measure the effectiveness of our advertising, make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly and otherwise help enhance your player experience. You can disable cookies, limit the types of cookies you allow, or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. Please refer to guidance provided by your individual web browser if you'd like help in managing your cookie preferences.<br><br>We use other technologies for similar purposes as a cookie. We use tracking pixels or clear GIFs to collect information about your use of our Services and your response to our marketing emails. We use Internet log files (which contain technical data such as your IP address) to monitor traffic on our Services, troubleshoot technical problems, detect and prevent fraud, and enforce our User Agreement. Other examples include HTML 5 cookies, Silverlight Application Storage, device fingerprints and "flash cookies." If you want to remove flash cookies or prevent them from being placed, adjust your preferences in the Macromedia Website Privacy Settings Panel at <a href="https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/">www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/</a>. We currently do not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. You may opt out of certain types of tracking, including certain analytics and tailored advertising, by changing your cookie settings.<br><br>We also use Analytics, Advertising, Anti-Cheat and Anti-Fraud technologies in our Services that utilize the same cookies and similar mechanisms. These technologies are described below.<br><br></span></li>
<li>Analytics Technologies<br><br><span style="font-weight: normal; color: #000000;">We use our own game servers and internal and third party analytic technologies to collect information about how you use our Services, your computer or device and the health of our Services.<br><br>For instance, EA may collect and store data from your computer or device when you use our Services. This information includes technical and related information about your computer or device and operating system (such as IP Address and device ID), information about your feature usage, gameplay and usage statistics, system interactions and peripheral hardware for purposes described in Section 3, below. If you play a game offline, this data will be stored on your device and transmitted to EA when your device connects to the Internet. If you participate in online Services, EA also may collect, use, store, transmit and publicly display your persona and/or statistical data regarding your game play (including scores, rankings and accomplishments), or identify content that is created and shared by you with other players.<br><br>Third party analytics technologies integrated into our Services may combine the information they collect in connection with EA's Services with information they have independently collected over time and across different websites. Many of these companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies. A list of third party analytics companies that operate in our Services as well as how to opt out to the extent applicable can be found at <a href="https://tos.ea.com/legalapp/WEBPRIVACYAPPENDIX/US/en/PC/">privacyappendix.ea.com</a>.<br><br></span></li>
<li>Ad Serving Technologies<br><br><span style="font-weight: normal; color: #000000;">Some of our Services employ ad serving technologies that use cookies, clear GIFs, web beacons, tracking pixels, and other similar technologies ("<b>Technologies</b>") to deliver offers to you. Some of these technologies can sync or connect behavior across different websites, mobile apps and devices. The ads can be tailored to your interests. For instance, you may be presented with an offer for a game we think you might enjoy. Or if you express interest in a game, you might receive an advertisement later for that game or similar Services on EA or third party sites. Other in-game advertising technologies enable advertising to be temporarily uploaded to your game, web browser, or mobile device and later replaced while you are online.<br><br>These technologies collect and use information so we can serve appropriate advertising to you and help track results and measure effectiveness. In addition to identifiers, this information includes:<br><br></span>
<ul style="font-weight: normal; color: #000000; font-family: calibri;">
<li>Advertisements served and the location of the ad;</li>
<li>Length of time an advertisement was visible;</li>
<li>Domain type, IP address, size of the advertisement; and</li>
<li>Advertisement response.<br><br></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: normal; color: #000000;">Third party advertising companies may combine the information collected in the context of delivering an ad to you via our Services with other information they have independently collected over time and across different websites. Many of these companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies. A list of ad serving companies that operate their own networks on our sites and online and/or mobile games and/or Services as well as how to opt out to the extent applicable can be found at <a href="https://tos.ea.com/legalapp/WEBPRIVACYAPPENDIX/US/en/PC/">privacyappendix.ea.com</a>.<br><br>To learn more about some of these ad networks' practices, or to opt out of third party targeted advertising, you can visit <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org">www.networkadvertising.org</a>, <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices/">www.aboutads.info/choices</a>, <a href="http://youradchoices.ca/">youradchoices.ca</a>, or <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.eu">www.youronlinechoices.eu</a>. Note that opting out does not mean you won't see ads; it just means that the advertising you see may be less relevant to your interests.<br><br></span></li>
<li>Anti-Cheat and Fraud Prevention Technologies<br><br><span style="font-weight: normal; color: #000000;">EA strives to provide a safe and fair gaming environment for all players. When you log in to one of our Services, set up an EA Account or make purchases, we or third parties may use cookies and similar technologies, or collect data about your machine or device, to create a machine "fingerprint" or "hash" of your machine components, for fraud prevention, security and authentication purposes. We may also monitor publicly-available information, third party sites and/or use anti-cheat technology with our Services, including automated anti-fraud and abuse algorithms. If you believe your access to our games and/or Services was blocked by this technology in error, please contact EA Help at <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/">help.ea.com</a>.<br></span></li>

We may also combine and share such information and other information (such as your de-identified account information, demographic information, hardware specifications, and past purchase history) with third-party advertising partners. These advertising partners may use this information (and similar information collected from other websites) for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements to you when you visit third-party websites within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as "interest-based advertising" or "online behavorial advertising." We may allow access to other data collected by the Services to share information that may be userful, relevant, valuable or otherwise of interest to you.<br><br>If you prefer not to share your EA personal information with third-party advertising partners, you may follow the instructions on this page to change your settings: <a href="https://tos.ea.com/legalapp/WEBPRIVACYCA/US/en/PC/">https://tos.ea.com/legalapp/WEBPRIVACYCA/US/en/PC/</a>.<br><br><span style="color: #003366;"><b>Disclosures to protect us or others.</b></span> We may access, preserve, and disclose any information we store associated with you to external parties if we, in good faith, believe doing so is required or appropriate to: comply with law enforcement or national security requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; protect your, our or others' rights, property, or safety; enforce our policies or contracts; collect amounts owed to us; or assist with an investigation or prosecution of suspected or actual illegal activity.<br><br><span style="color: #003366;"><b>Disclosure in the event of merger, sale, or other asset transfer.</b></span> In the event of a reorganization, divestiture, merger, sale or bankruptcy, we may transfer all information we collect to the relevant third party and will obtain your consent to do so if required by law or contract.<br><br><span style="color: #003366;"><b>Third-party plugins.</b></span> When third-party technologies or social tools are integrated into our Services, those third parties may collect information about your use of our Services.

<h2><span style="color: #003366;"><a name="section5"></a>5. Where We Hold Your Information</span></h2>
Personal information we collect may be stored and processed for the purposes set out in this Privacy and Cookie Policy in the United States or any other country in which EA, its subsidiaries, or third party agents operate. By using our Services, you acknowledge that your personal information may be transferred to recipients in the United States and other countries that may not offer the same level of privacy protection as the laws in your country of residence or citizenship.<br><br>EA's privacy practices comply with the APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules System. The APEC CBPR system provides a framework for organizations to ensure protection of personal information transferred among participating APEC economies. More information about the APEC framework can be found at <a href="https://www.apec.org/Groups/Committee-on-Trade-and-Investment/~/media/Files/Groups/ECSG/CBPR/CBPR-PoliciesRulesGuidelines.ashx">https://www.apec.org/Groups/Committee-on-Trade-and-Investment/~/media/Files/Groups/ECSG/CBPR/CBPR-PoliciesRulesGuidelines.ashx</a>.<br><br>Information is collected by our parent company, Electronic Arts, Inc. For information regarding the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom and Switzerland, Electronic Arts, Inc. holds certifications under the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield (which are available at <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000GnuQAAS&amp;status=Active">www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000GnuQAAS&amp;status=Active</a>). When Electronic Arts, Inc. transfers information from the EEA, United Kingdom and Switzerland to other affiliates, agents or service providers that are outside the EEA, United Kingdom and Switzerland, it will do so in compliance with the 'Accountability for Onward Transfer' principle of the Privacy Shield.<br>
<h2><span style="color: #003366;"><a name="section6"></a>6. How We Protect Your Personal Information</span></h2>
Security of our players' information is a priority at EA, and we take a range of measures to help protect it, including encryption of sensitive financial information. Even so, no security measure is 100% perfect. This means we cannot guarantee the security of your information and do not assume any responsibility for the unauthorized use or access to your information under our control.<br>
<h2><span style="color: #003366;"><a name="section7"></a>7. Children</span></h2>
Protecting children's privacy online is extremely important to EA. Many EA online and mobile games and Services are intended for adults and do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. Meanwhile, other Services provide a different experience for players based on their age. When players identify themselves as being children we will: (1) not provide a path for them to share personal information, (2) collect certain information for limited purposes only, (3) block or restrict the child from accessing relevant Services, such as chat functionality; and/or (4) obtain consent from parents for the use of their children's personal information, all according to applicable law. When we say children, we mean under the age of 13 in the United States, or the minimum age in the child's territory. Through our mobile applications, your child will be able to receive local in-app notifications, which do not rely on any personal information.<br><br>Please note that if you are a parent or guardian and grant consent for your child to use EA's online or mobile games and Services, this may include such general audience communication services as email, instant messaging, and online groups, and your child will be able to communicate with, and disclose personal information to, other players of all ages.<br><br>If you are a parent and wish to revoke your previously provided consent, review information collected from your child or have that information deleted, contact the appropriate Privacy Policy Administrator for your country listed at <a href="http://privacyadmin.ea.com">privacyadmin.ea.com</a>. If we become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, we will delete any personal information we have collected, unless we have a legal obligation to keep it, and terminate the child's account and/or revert them to the underage experience, as applicable.<br><br>Information collected is secured in a manner consistent with this Privacy and Cookie Policy. If we make material changes to how we use, collect, or share your child's personal information, we will notify parents by email or by in-game notice to obtain their consent for the new uses of your child's personal information.<br><br>We encourage you to talk with your children about communicating with strangers and disclosing personal information online. You and your child should review our Online Safety web page at <a href="https://tos.ea.com/legalapp/OnlineSafety/US/en/PC/">https://tos.ea.com/legalapp/OnlineSafety/US/en/PC/</a> for additional information about using the Internet safely.<br><br>Under no circumstances do we condition a child's participation in an activity—like contests—on the child's disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. On certain sites, we may not permit children to participate at all, even if we have consent.<br>
