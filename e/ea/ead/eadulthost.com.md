For such use, you may be required to provide your e-mail address and other personally-identifying information (such as your name, phone number or date of birth) as we may deem necessary.

You are solely responsible for the security of your username and password.
    We use reasonable measures to protect information that is stored within our database, and we restrict access to information to those who need access to perform their job functions, such as our technical staff, and they are instructed that the information is to be used only in adherence with the provisions set forth in this Privacy Policy and applicable laws. 
    Please note that we cannot guarantee the security of account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of information. 
    We use encryption and authentication tools among other methods to protect your personal information. E-mails you send us are not necessarily secure when they are transmitted. If your communication is sensitive or includes highly confidential information, you may want to provide it by post.
