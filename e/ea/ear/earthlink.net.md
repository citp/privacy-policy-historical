# Privacy Policies

**Privacy Statement for Earthlink Network**   
At Earthlink, protecting your privacy is very important. We want to make your experience on the Internet as comfortable and rewarding as possible, and we want you to make use of the Internet’s vast array of information, tools and opportunities with complete confidence. 

We’ve created this statement to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and security, and to let you know about the processes we use. The statement discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices we use on our Web sites: [www.earthlink.net](http://www.earthlink.net/), [help.earthlink.net](http://help.earthlink.net/), [start.earthlink.net](http://start.earthlink.net/), and [themall.earthlink.net](http://themall.earthlink.net/). 

**User information**   
When users visit the pages of the Earthlink sites, they may be asked to give us contact information, such as their names and email addresses. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services. 

Our sites use order forms for customers to request information, products and services. Contact information from the order forms, such as a user’s email address, is used to send orders and information about our company to our customers 

Our online surveys ask users for contact information (such as their email addresses) and demographic information (such as zip codes, age, or income levels). We use contact data from our surveys to send information about our company to our users. We use demographic and profile data to tailor our sites and display content according to our users’ interests and preferences. This information is shared with advertisers only on an aggregate basis. We do not share any personal information about our users. We run contests on our sites in which we ask users for contact information, such as their email addresses. The customer’s contact information is used to contact the user when necessary. 

In all cases above, users may opt out of receiving future mailings that may result from providing email addresses. See the Choice to Opt Out section, below. 

Our sites may also record the user’s IP address, which helps us diagnose problems with our server and administer our Web site. Your IP address also is used to gather broad demographic information.

Cookies are tiny data files that are placed on your hard drive when you visit some Web sites. Only information that you specifically supply, such as a user ID, will be included in the cookie.
