<p>Please be aware that this Privacy Policy, and any other policies in place, in addition to any amendments, does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to members of the Service or Site.&nbsp; EarthEcho International bears no responsibility for the information collected or used by any advertiser or third party website. &nbsp;Please review the privacy policy and terms of service for each site you visit through third party links.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>9.&nbsp; Third Party Access to Your Information</p>

<p>Although you are entering into an Agreement with EarthEcho International to disclose your information to us, we do use third party individuals and organizations to assist us, including contractors, web hosts, and others.</p>

<p>Throughout the course of our provision of our Service to you, we may delegate our authority to collect, access, use, and disseminate your information.&nbsp; For example, our web host stores the information that you provide us, and we may hire outside contractors to perform maintenance or assist us in securing our website.</p>

<p>It is therefore necessary that you grant the third parties we may use in the course of our business the same rights that you afford us under this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; For this reason, you hereby agree that for every authorization which you grant to us in this Privacy Policy, you also grant to any third party that we may hire, contract, or otherwise retain the services of for the purpose of operating, maintaining, repairing, or otherwise improving or preserving our website or its underlying files or systems.&nbsp; You agree not to hold us liable for the actions of any of these third parties, even if we would normally be held vicariously liable for their actions, and that you must take legal action against them directly should they commit any tort or other actionable wrong against you.</p>

<p>Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you authorize us to collect, share, store, and otherwise use your information in conjunction with Facebook and Google.</p>

<p>10.&nbsp; Release of Your Information for Legal Purposes</p>

<p>At times it may become necessary or desirable to EarthEcho International, for legal purposes, to release your information in response to a request from a government agency or a private litigant.&nbsp; You agree that we may disclose your information to a third party where we believe, in good faith, that it is desirable to do so for the purposes of a civil action, criminal investigation, or other legal matter.&nbsp; In the event that we receive a subpoena affecting your privacy, we may elect to notify you to give you an opportunity to file a motion to quash the subpoena, or we may attempt to quash it ourselves, but we are not obligated to do either.&nbsp; We may also proactively report you, and release your information to, third parties where we believe that it is prudent to do so for legal reasons, such as our belief that you have engaged in fraudulent activities.&nbsp; You release us from any damages that may arise from or relate to the release of your information to a request from law enforcement agencies or private litigants.</p>

<p>11.&nbsp; Commercial and Non-Commercial Communications</p>

<p>By providing information to the Service that forms the basis of communications with you, such as contact information, you waive all rights to file complaints concerning unsolicited email from EarthEcho International since, by providing such information, you agree to receive communications from us or anyone else covered under this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; However, you may unsubscribe from certain communications by notifying EarthEcho International that you no longer wish to receive solicitations or information and we will endeavor to remove you from the database.</p>

<p>12.&nbsp; Security Measures</p>

<p>14.&nbsp; International Transfer</p>

<p>Your information may be transferred to—and maintained on—computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. &nbsp;If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, EarthEcho International transfers Personal Information to the United States and processes it there. &nbsp;Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>
