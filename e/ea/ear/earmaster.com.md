EarMaster will not disclose this information to third parties (unless we are required to do so by law) and will protect this information in accordance with our strict security and confidentiality standards.

Security of your Personal Information  
EarMaster is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, when we transmit sensitive personal information (such as a credit card number) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. We do not store credit card numbers as they only exist temporarily in the order system while the payment is approved.
