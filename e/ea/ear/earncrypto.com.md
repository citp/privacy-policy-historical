### Information Collected by Earncrypto

To become a member of Earncrypto, you must join and create an account on the Earncrypto website. The only information that Earncrypto collects is the information you provide through the Earncrypto registration process, and the information you provide when you update your payment options. This information includes your first and last name, your email address, your Internet Protocol Address ("IP address"), your SSN (only used if you are from USA and have earned over $600+ in rewards in a given year - for tax purposes), and other contact information. Your IP address is recorded when you register, so that Earncrypto can enforce its one account per person policy and other provisions of our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/web/20180623170142id_/https%3A//www.earncrypto.com/terms.php).

Other information, that does not personally identify you as an individual, is collected by Earncrypto from the website (such as, by way of example, patterns of utilization), and it is exclusively owned by Earncrypto. This information can be utilized by Earncrypto in such manner as Earncrypto, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate.

### Information Sharing & Disclosure

Earncrypto will not share your personal information with the Third-Parties for the purpose of advertising, i.e. sending unsolicited email. Your email address will be used, however, for tracking purposes, when you complete offers, so that Earncrypto can determine that you completed the offers. Earncrypto will also use your email address to send you the Earncrypto newsletters, unless you have opted out of receiving such newsletters by so indicating on the "E-mail Alerts" section of the "My Account" page, within the "Settings" of the Earncrypto website.
