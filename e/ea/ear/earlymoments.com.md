At Early Moments, a Sandvik Publishing brand, its related subsidiaries, affiliates and concerns (collectively “Company”, “we”, or “us”), your privacy matters to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share and protect information about you. We also provide information regarding how you can access and update your information and make certain choices about how your information is used.

By providing your email address to us, purchasing, downloading, installing, or using any products or services including, but not limited to all books, products, websites, native application, mobile applications, tools, modules, services residing on servers owned and/or operated by third parties (“Services”) as provided by Early Moments, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, the Early Moments Terms of Service Policy and any other policies, rules or guidelines that may be applicable to particular offers or features of the Services (“the Agreement”) and agree to be legally bound by these terms.

Throughout this Privacy Policy, we use the term “Personal Information” to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal information to include information that has been made anonymous or aggregated so that it can no longer be used, whether in combination with other information or otherwise, to identify a specific person.

Access from Outside the United States:

The Services are directed to people residing in the United States. We do not represent that content available on or through the Services is appropriate or available in other locations, or that this privacy policy meets and complies with any non-U.S. local, national or transnational law or regulation governing the use, collection, and transfer of personal identification. We may limit the availability of the Services or products described on the Services to any person or geographic area at any time.

You may also provide us photos, a personal description and information about your preferences for recommendations.

**(b) Information We Collect.**

In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us, our third-party service providers and we may use a variety of technologies that collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Services (” Usage Information”). This Usage Information may include, but is not limited to, the browser that you are using, your internet protocol (“IP”) address, GPS or other triangulation-based location data, the URL that referred you to our services, all of the areas within our services that you visit, and the time of day, among other information.

**(c) Information Provided by Third Parties.**

We may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect about you through our services with outside records from third parties such as information that is publicly available and data that we receive from other reputable and trusted sources in order to enhance our ability to serve you and to tailor our content to you. We may combine the information we receive from those sources with information we collect through our services. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any Personal Information received, unless we have disclosed otherwise. We may also collect information about social network accounts and contacts from third party social media websites that provide access to this information. We respect and follow the privacy policies of those third party services respectfully with regard to the data we collect from them.

**(d) How We Collect Usage Information.**

A few of the methods that may be used to collect Usage Information include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent technology and methods hereafter developed):

**(a) Cookies**. A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to access the Services. A Flash cookie is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device. Cookies and Flash Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages. Cookies work by assigning a number to the user that has no meaning outside of the assigning website.

If you do not want information to be collected through the use of cookies, your browser allows you to deny or accept the use of cookies. Cookies can be disabled or controlled by setting a preference within your web browser or on your Device. If you choose to disable cookies or Flash cookies on your Device, some features of the Services may not function properly or may not be able to customize the delivery of information to you.

**(b)** **Web** **Beacons**. Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1×1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our web and mobile pages and messages. The web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored in a user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Web beacons or similar technologies help us better manage content on our Services by informing us what content is effective, count users of the Services, monitor how users navigate the Services, count how many e-mails that we send were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed. We do not tie the information gathered by web beacons to your personal information.

**(c)** **Embedded Scripts.  **An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Services, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.

Any third parties that are linked to through the site or that may advertise on our site may use their own cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts and other technology to collect information about you. You should be aware that the Company cannot control the use of cookies (or the resulting information) by third parties, and use of third party cookies is not covered by our Privacy Policy.
