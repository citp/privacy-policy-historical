Information Collection and Use

When you set up an account on our Web site or purchase an item from our Web site, we collect personal information provided by you that may include your: (i) first and last name; (ii) billing address; (iii) shipping address; (iv) other shipping addresses; (v) e-mail address; (vi) phone number; (vii) credit card account number; (viii) items purchased from us; and (ix) browsing, buying and selling patterns. We use this personal information in order to provide you with the goods and services that you purchase on our Web site. We use your e-mail address or mailing address to provide you with information about your order and its status and we may occasionally send out e-mails and mail to people who have placed an order online, with information about other goods and services available on our Web site or from partner companies. Your phone number is used by us only in the event that our customer care representatives need to contact you about an order you have placed, to respond to an inquiry from you or to make offers for new products or services from us or our partners that we believe will be of interest to you.

 **SPI**  owns and operates this Web site and we are the sole owner of this information collected on the Web site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to a third party in any way other than as disclosed in this privacy policy. We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for illegal activities and may, in our sole discretion, disclose personal information or other information to satisfy any law, regulation, subpoena, or government request. We reserve the right to release personal information or other information about users who we believe are engaged in illegal activities or are otherwise in violation of our Terms of Service, even without a subpoena, warrant or court order, if we believe, in our sole discretion, that such disclosure is necessary or appropriate to operate our Web site or to protect the rights or property of our Web site, our affiliates, or our officers, directors, employees, agents, third-party content providers, suppliers, sponsors, or licensors. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities we reasonably believe in our sole discretion to be unlawful. If we are legally compelled to disclose information about you to a third party, we will attempt to notify you by sending an e-mail to the e-mail address in our records unless doing so would violate the law or unless you have not provided your e-mail address to us.

Orders

We request additional personal information from our users when placing an order on our Web site. In completing our order form, a user may provide contact information, such as name and shipping address, and financial information, such as credit card account number and expiration date. This information is used for billing purposes and to fulfill our customer orders. If we experience difficulties processing an order, we will contact a user through this information. While entering information into user forms on the Web site, personal information may be collected prior to the user clicking the submit button. Information collected in this manner may be used to contact users about their finished or unfinished transactions.

Cookies

A cookie is a text file stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Web sites create cookies to record information about a user's preferences, such as the items you add to your shopping cart, and for security purposes (see Security below). Cookies are also used to help us determine the various services you use and the support you may need, and to help us detect and solve any problems you may have while using our web site. In addition, the use of a cookie on our Web site will enable users to log on without having to reenter their password on each visit. Most cookies expire after a certain time period (365 days for this Web site). If you wish, you may set your browser to reject all cookies. Cookies placed by our Web site may be tied to personally identifiable information.

Log Files

Like most Web sites, we use log files. These log files store information regarding IP (internet protocol) addresses, browser type, ISP (internet service provider), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. These log files are used to analyze trends, administer the Web site, track user's movements in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for our use. IP addresses, etc. may be linked to personal information if you have placed an order on our Web site. 

Sharing of General or Demographic Information

We may share aggregated, general or demographic information we collect about our users and their use of our Web site with our partners in a manner which does not identify any individual user. We use an outside shipping company to ship orders placed on our Web site, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services purchased on our Web site. These companies will not retain, share, store or use any of our user's personal information for any secondary purposes.

Links

The Web site contains links to other Web sites. We want you to be aware that when you click on such links which take you to a third-party Web site, you will be subject to such third-party's privacy policies. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other Web sites and we expressly disclaim any and all liability for the actions of third-parties, including, without limitation, actions relating to the use and/or disclosure of personal information by such third-parties. We encourage our users to be aware of when they leave our Web site and enter a third-party Web site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects their personal information. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by our Web site.

Security

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use strong industry standard means to protect your personal information, like all Internet sites, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about the security of our Web site, please contact Customer Care at 1-800-353-3140.

Communications from our Web Site

Customers may occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and e-newsletters. Each user has the option to not receive these types of communications. Occasionally, it is necessary to send out service-related announcements. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an e-mail informing you of such service interruption. Generally, users may not opt-out of receiving these service-related communications. In addition, we communicate with our users on a regular basis to provide requested services and regarding issues relating to their account via e-mail.

Choice/Opt-out

Users who no longer wish to receive any marketing or promotional materials from us or our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to any such promotional e-mail indicating your desire to no longer receive such e-mails, or by contacting Customer Care at 1-800-353-3140.

Collecting Information from Children Younger than 18

Our Web site does not knowingly collect or use any personal information from children under the age of 18 without obtaining verifiable parental consent. 

Notification of Changes in Use of Information

Our privacy policy is subject to change. In the event of any change, we will provide notice of such change on our Web site. If we want to use your personal information in a manner different from that stated to you at the time you provided such information to us, we will notify you of such change via e-mail in addition to posting notification of such change on our Web site. At such time, you can determine whether you wish to allow us to use your information in this different manner.
