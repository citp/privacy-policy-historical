# Privacy Policy | Earthjustice

Earthjustice is committed to maintaining the privacy of those who visit earthjustice.org.

Earthjustice is the sole owner of the information collected on this website. This information will not be sold or rented to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Earthjustice collects information from site visitors at several different points on this website.

We collect only the domain name, but not the e-mail address, of visitors to our website, aggregate information on what pages visitors access, information volunteered by the visitor (such as survey information, e-mail and other addresses), and other personal information.

The information we collect is used to improve the content of our website, to notify visitors about updates to our website, and alert visitors about issues and opportunities. The information is not shared with other organizations for commercial purposes. All personal information is stored on a secure server with password protection.

As we continue our push into the digital age, we are seeing a significant rise in "phishing" (tricking people into visiting bogus websites to steal e-mail addresses and passwords) and other online scams as criminals migrate their schemes to the Internet. In light of this issue, we are encouraging all our members to be more diligent about online security.

### Donor Privacy Policy

Earthjustice will never share donor giving information with other organizations. However, like many other groups, Earthjustice may exchange its donor mailing list with like-minded organizations—many of which we represent through our environmental law work. If you wish to opt out of having your name and address shared with other organizations, call, email, or write to us at:

Earthjustice  
50 California Street, Suite 500  
San Francisco, CA  94111

### Financial Transactions

To process a charitable contribution or product purchase, it is necessary for Earthjustice to gather the visitor's name, email address, mailing address, phone, and credit card information. This data is used to verify identity and execute the financial transaction. Additionally, phone number and email address information may be used to contact visitors if there is a problem with the transaction.

Earthjustice may use service providers (such as merchant banks and ecommerce integrators) for the express purpose of conducting financial transactions. Personal information collected to conduct financial transactions is kept private and secure and is not sold, rented, or traded to third parties. It is important to note that credit card numbers are used only at the time of the transaction, and are not stored following the conclusion of the transaction unless a transaction is selected that occurs on a regular basis. For transactions that recur, credit card information is stored in an encrypted format.

### Electronic Newsletter

If a site visitor chooses to subscribe to any of our electronic newsletters through the sign-up forms on our site or while making a donation, Earthjustice requests contact information such as name and email address.

### Action Center

Earthjustice provides an advocacy service allowing site visitors to contact policy makers on issues of concern. Contact information such as name and email address are requested. If cookies are enabled on a visitor's computer, then our site will use cookies to identify previous users of our advocacy service to enhance their experience.

### Links

Earthjustice provides links to other websites. Earthjustice is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. Site visitors are encouraged to be aware when they leave earthjustice.org and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by earthjustice.org.

### Changes To This Policy

Earthjustice reserves the right, in its sole discretion and without any obligation, to modify or correct any errors or omissions in any portion of this website. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will post the policy changes to our website to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back at our website periodically.
