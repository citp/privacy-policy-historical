# Earthjustice: Privacy Policy

Privacy Policy  
Earthjustice is committed to maintaining the privacy of those who visit www.earthjustice.org. 

Earthjustice is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. This information will not be sold or rented to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Earthjustice collects information from site visitors at several different points on this website.

We collect only the domain name, but not the e-mail address, of visitors to our Web site, aggregate information on what pages visitors access, information volunteered by the visitor (such as survey information, e-mail and other addresses), and other personal information.

The information we collect is used to improve the content of our Web site, to notify visitors about updates to our Web site, and alert visitors about issues and opportunities. The information is not shared with other organizations for commercial purposes. All personal information is stored on a secure server with password protection.

Financial Transactions  
To process a charitable contribution or product purchase, it is necessary for Earthjustice to gather the visitor's name, email address, mailing address, phone, and credit card information. This data is used to verify identity and execute the financial transaction. Additionally, phone number and email address information may be used to contact visitors if there is a problem with the transaction.

Earthjustice may use service providers (such as merchant banks and ecommerce integrators) for the express purpose of conducting financial transactions. Personal information is kept private and secure and is not sold, rented, or traded to third parties. It is important to note that credit card numbers are used only at the time of the transaction, and are not stored following the conclusion of the transaction unless a transaction is selected that occurs on a regular basis. For transactions that recur, credit card information is stored in an encrypted format. 

Electronic Newsletter  
If a site visitor chooses to subscribe to any of our electronic newsletters through the sign-up forms on our site or while making a donation, Earthjustice requests contact information such as name and email address.

Action Center  
Earthjustice provides an advocacy service allowing site visitors to contact policy makers on issues of concern. Contact information such as name and email address are requested. If cookies are enabled on a visitor's computer, then our site will use cookies to identify previous users of our advocacy service to enhance their experience.

Links  
Earthjustice provides links to other web sites. Earthjustice is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. Site visitors are encouraged to be aware when they leave www.earthjustice.org and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by www.earthjustice.org.

Changes to this policy   
Earthjustice reserves the right, in its sole discretion and without any obligation, to modify or correct any errors or omissions in any portion of this web site. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will post the policy changes to our Web site to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses.
