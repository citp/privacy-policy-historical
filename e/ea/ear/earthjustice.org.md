# Privacy Policy | Earthjustice

We consider it a privilege when you choose to support Earthjustice. At Earthjustice, your privacy and security are critically important to us.

Our fundamental privacy principles are transparency and fairness. In keeping with these principles, Earthjustice (“Earthjustice,” “we,” “our” or “us”) wants you to understand what kinds of information we collect about you, why we collect it and how we use or disclose it. We also want to make sure you know your rights regarding our collection, use and disclosure of that information.

We’ve tried to write this policy in a way that’s easy to understand, but some of it is technical. If you have any questions or concerns about this policy, please contact us.

This policy applies solely to information collected by earthjustice.org (the “Site”), and is effective February 15, 2019. If you use our Site on or after February 15, 2019, you agree to the new policy.

### The Kinds Of Information We Collect About You

Earthjustice has implemented administrative and technical security measures to safeguard any personally identifying information we collect online against unauthorized access, destruction, or alteration.

Information we collect from you is stored on secure servers and is not publicly accessible, unless you chose to have Earthjustice disclose your personally identifiable information, for example, when you use our advocacy service to contact decision-makers. We use encrypted connections when processing financial and advocacy transactions through our website.

#### Information You Give Us Voluntarily

Earthjustice collects, retains and uses information you provide to us or give us permission to obtain. For example, you voluntarily provide or allow us to obtain information when you:

  * **Donate to or Purchase from Earthjustice.** We request, collect and retain certain information necessary to verify your identity, prevent fraud and process your requested donation or purchase. This includes your name, email address, billing address, credit card information, phone number, donation and/or purchase amount, and other personally identifiable information you share with us. We collect, transmit and retain credit card transaction information in conformity with the [Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/).
  * **Use Earthjustice’s Site.** We request, collect and retain certain information when you fill in a form, register for an event, subscribe to our electronic newsletter, respond to surveys, post to community forums or use other features of our Site. This includes your name, email address, mailing address, phone number and other personally identifiable information you share with us.
  * **Use Our Advocacy Service.** Earthjustice’s advocacy service allows you to contact policy and/or decision makers about issues that concern you. If you participate in our advocacy service, we request, collect, and retain your name, email address, mailing address, phone number and other personally identifiable information you share with us. We also collect and retain: (1) the actions in which you participate and (2) the content of the messages you wrote and/or sent.
  * **Communicate with Us Online.** Sometimes we request, collect and/or retain information when you communicate with us online, which may include your name, email address, mailing address, phone number, and other personally identifiable information you share with us.

The above information is collected and processed, based on your consent, to fulfill your purchases and/or donations, to keep you up to date on Earthjustice’s work and issues that are important to you, to maintain and expand our relationship with you and other supporters, and for our other legitimate purposes.
