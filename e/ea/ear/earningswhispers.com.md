Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and any account information.

Remember to log out of your EarningsWhispers.com account and close your browser when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if your computer is accessible to others or if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet caf.
