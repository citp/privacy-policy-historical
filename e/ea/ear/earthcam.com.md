**Your secret is safe with us...**

EarthCam's policy is to respect and protect the privacy of our users. EarthCam takes your privacy concerns seriously and firmly supports protecting your privacy online. EarthCam will never deliberately reveal private information about our users to any third party without first receiving that user's consent. EarthCam will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to anyone. Please read through this policy statement to understand our practices regarding privacy and learn how we use the information collected from you. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: EarthCam.

EarthCam shares information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties. We refer to our users as an entirety, not as individuals. For example, we will compare EarthCam's audience of females vs. males with the use of variables such as x and y. The data collected is used to tailor EarthCam content and advertising for our users. 

There are instances where EarthCam asks for your personal information such as your name and e-mail address. We do this when you submit a camera site to EarthCam, sign up for EarthCam's free newsletter, sign up for EarthCam's services, send postcards or whenever you enter an EarthCam sweepstakes or other EarthCam promotions. The user's contact information is used to contact the user when necessary and to advise them about new services, products and/or software upgrades. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. If EarthCam intends to disclose personal information in some restricted situation, this is specifically explained to you when we collect the information in the rules of sweepstakes or other promotions.
