EarthCam - Privacy Policy

EarthCam's policy is to respect and protect the privacy of our users. EarthCam takes your privacy concerns seriously and firmly supports protecting your privacy online. EarthCam will never deliberately reveal private information about our users to any third party without first receiving that user's consent. EarthCam will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to anyone. Please read through this policy statement to understand our practices regarding privacy and learn how we use the information collected from you. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website. 

  
There are instances where EarthCam asks for personal information, such as name and email address, to authenticate users and to send notifications to those users relating to EarthCam. We do this when you submit a camera site to EarthCam, sign up for EarthCam's free newsletter, sign up for EarthCam's services, post an image to the Hall of Fame, post an image to Facebook or Twitter, and send postcards or whenever you enter an EarthCam sweepstakes or other EarthCam promotion. The user's contact information is used to allow the user to utilize EarthCam features; contact the user when necessary; and advise them about new services, products and/or software upgrades. The user's Facebook and Twitter account information will only be utilized to post an image or video to the user's account as requested by the user. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the Choice/Opt-Out section below. If EarthCam intends to disclose personal information in some restricted situation, this is specifically explained to you when we collect the information in the rules of sweepstakes or other promotions. 

EarthCam also logs non-personally-identifiable information including IP address, profile information, aggregate user data, and browser type, from users and visitors to the site. This data is used to manage the website, track usage, and improve the website services. This non-personally-identifiable information may be shared with third parties to provide more relevant services and advertisements. User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes. 

Unique identifiers are collected for use as account numbers in our record system. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor the user's experience at our site and in displaying the content according to their preferences. 

EarthCam shares information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties. We refer to our users as an entirety, not as individuals. For example, we will compare EarthCam's audience of females vs. males with the use of variables such as x and y.
