# Earthlink Policies & Agreements - Privacy Policy

**1\. What does the EarthLink Consumer Privacy Policy cover?**

This Privacy Policy covers (i) the use and retention of personally identifiable information ("PII") that EarthLink, LLC ("EarthLink") collects from our customers and visitors to the webpages on earthlink.net under the Residential tab, peoplepc.com and all of their subdomains (collectively, the "EarthLink Consumer Website") and (ii) your options with regard to that collection and use. The EarthLink Consumer Website and the services and products offered on or through the EarthLink Consumer Website are collectively referred to in this Privacy Policy as the "EarthLink Consumer Services".

EarthLink is committed to protecting the privacy and security of your PII and will not share, sell or license your PII except in very limited circumstances as described below. All PII collected by EarthLink including, but not limited to, via the Internet, via any EarthLink Consumer mobile application, via mail or over the telephone is protected by the terms of this Privacy Policy.

**2\. What is PII?**

PII is any information that can be used to personally identify you, including, but not limited to:

  * Information you provide in connection with your purchase of or subscription to EarthLink Consumer Services including your name, mailing and/or shipping address, telephone number, email address, and credit card number.
  * Transaction and activity information about your EarthLink Consumer Services; your customer account and billing records; your interactions with our customer service and/or technical support representatives over the telephone, email or through online chat; and your contest entries.
  * Information obtained by EarthLink through its Refer a Friend Program.



**3\. How EarthLink uses your PII**

EarthLink uses your PII to (i) provide your EarthLink Consumer Services to you, (ii) establish and manage your customer account and billing records, (iii) contact you about your customer account including your EarthLink Consumer Services and other products and services that we offer or that we offer in conjunction with an affiliate company, (iv) provide you with additional information that may be of interest to you such as news about EarthLink, (v) resolve billing problems, (vi) provide customized technical support, (vii) monitor your EarthLink Consumer Services, (viii) monitor and protect our network, (ix) protect against fraudulent, abusive, unauthorized or unlawful use of the EarthLink Consumer Services, (x) provide customized personal start pages, and (xi) administer surveys and contests.

If you apply online for a position at EarthLink, we will only use the information you provide for job recruitment and other customary human resources purposes.

EarthLink may supplement your PII with information received from publicly available sources, such as demographic information, to help us develop and improve the EarthLink Consumer Services and to send marketing offers to you that may be of interest to you.

**4\. How EarthLink protects the Security of PII**

EarthLink has implemented an information security program that contains administrative, technical and physical controls that are designed to safeguard your PII and non-personally identifiable information. We use industry standards to secure PII when it is being collected and transmitted over the Internet as well as firewalls, security monitoring, encryption and intrusion detection software. Although we cannot guarantee that our information security program will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use or disclose your PII, we maintain security and incident response practices to handle incidents involving unauthorized access, use or disclosure of your PII.

Under our practices and policies, access to PII is authorized only for EarthLink employees and contractors who have a business need for such access, and records are retained in accordance with applicable laws and then securely destroyed. EarthLink employees and contractors are trained on the importance of protecting privacy and on the proper access to, use of and disclosure of PII.

As an extra precaution, you should not share your password with anyone. EarthLink will only ask you for your password as part of a customer service or technical support call or online chat, and only in cases where you request customer support to access your account information or you request customer service or technical support in connection with the EarthLink Consumer Services.

**5\. Sharing of PII in Limited Circumstances**

EarthLink will not share, sell, or license your PII to third parties for their marketing purposes without your consent. EarthLink may disclose your PII in response to:

  * Subpoenas, court orders, search warrants or other valid legal process, or as otherwise authorized by law,
  * Circumstances where EarthLink has a good faith belief that a crime has been committed by an EarthLink customer or visitor,
  * An emergency that poses a safety threat to you or another person, or
  * Possible violations of the EarthLink Acceptable Use Policy or other EarthLink policies, available at [earthlink.net/about/policies/](http://www.earthlink.net/about/policies/).



When EarthLink uses third parties to perform business functions on our behalf, we require them through contracts to treat your PII confidentially and to only use your PII for the express purpose of providing the specific business functions for EarthLink. Examples of such third parties include, but are not limited to: (i) merchant banks for credit card authorizations, (ii) collection agencies, (iii) customer service companies, and (iv) market research companies.

Some EarthLink Consumer Services are offered to EarthLink customers in conjunction with a third-party vendor. To provide these services, the vendor may need to collect and retain your PII but the vendor will be required by contract with EarthLink to maintain the confidentiality of your PII.

If ownership of EarthLink changes, including as a result of a merger, acquisition, or the sale of its assets, your PII may be transferred or assigned as part of the transferred assets. If such a transfer results in a material change in the use of your PII, we will notify you about the material change.
