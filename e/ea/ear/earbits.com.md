### Use of Your Personal Information

You42 Radio collects and uses your personal information to operate and improve the Website and better deliver the Services. These uses may include performing analysis aimed at improving the Service and making the Website or Services more user friendly by reducing the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information.

We also use your personal information to communicate with you, such as providing you with mandatory notices or discretionary notices about the Service.  From time to time, we may also send you surveys or promotional mailings to inform you of other products or services available from You42 Radio and its affiliates.

In the event that you are offered to participate in a survey, such survey will includes a privacy statement that details the way You42 Radio will use the information submitted with that survey.

Personal information collected on You42 Radio sites and services may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which You42 Radio or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using a You42 Radio site or service, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.

You42 Radio occasionally hires other companies to provide limited administrative and communication services on our behalf, such as hosting websites, the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, or performing statistical analysis of the Services. Those companies will be permitted to obtain only such personal information as necessary for them to deliver the service. Those companies are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.

You42 Radio may access and/or disclose personal information about you or your account without your prior consent if You42 Radio has a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (i) comply with legal process or other legal requirements of any governmental authority; (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of You42 Radio (including the enforcement of our agreements); (iii) enforce the Terms of Use, which can be accessed at [www.You42 Radio.com/general_terms](http://www.you42%20radio.com/general_terms); (v) operate or conduct maintenance and repair of the Services or equipment as authorized by law; or (vi) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of You42 Radio Services or members of the public.

### Security of Your Personal Information

The personally identifiable information You42 Radio collects is securely stored within our database, and we use standard, industry-wide practices such as firewalls, encryption, and (in certain areas) Secure Socket Layers (“SSL”) for protecting your information. However, as effective as encryption technology is, no security system is impenetrable. You42 Radio cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to You42 Radio over the Internet. We recommend that you not disclose your password to anyone.
