                    	<h1>Privacy</h1>
						<p><em>Revised as of August 7, 2008</em> </p>
						<p> Earth Hour US is a project of World Wildlife Fund US.  Not only does WWF care about our planet, 
						  we care about online privacy. This privacy policy serves to inform you of what information we may 
						  collect about you, and how we may use that information. Please note that this privacy policy 
						  may change from time to time. </p>
						<p> Please read the following description of our privacy practices and, if you have any questions, 
						  visit our Help section, where you can view Frequently Asked Questions, submit a question via 
						  email and receive assistance from a WWF member services representative. You can also send a letter to:<br>

						<p> <a href="#one">I. What information may be collected</a><br>
                            <a href="#two">II. How information may be used</a><br>
                          <a href="#three">III. User control over collection and use of information</a> </p>
						<h3> <a name="one" id="one">I. WHAT INFORMATION MAY BE COLLECTED</a> </h3>
						<p> WWF collects two kinds of information: personal information that you choose to supply us, 
						  and non-personal information, such as your IP address. </p>
						<h3> A. Personally Identifiable Information </h3>
						<p> <strong>Newsletters, Online Postcards, Donations and Other WWF Information</strong><br>
						  If you subscribe to a WWF e-newsletter, request additional information about WWF, submit a 
						  donation online, or participate in any of the other services on the WWF web site that require 
						  personal information, we may request your name, mailing address, telephone number, email address, 
						  birth year, and eligibility to vote, in order to respond to your inquiries. If you send a friend 
						  an online postcard, we may request your name and email address as well as the name and email 
						  address of the friend to whom you wish to send the postcard. WWF may collect and store the 
						  information you choose to provide us to send you information about WWF and WWF partners and 
						  third parties from time to time. If you make a donation to WWF and elect to pay online, WWF 
						  will collect the necessary financial information. WWF collects and stores some information the 
						  user chooses to provide, including name, address and email address, to send users information 
						  about WWF and WWF partners and third parties from time to time. WWF will not disclose financial 
						  information except as necessary to fulfill users' donation requests. WWF collects such 
						  financial information in a secure manner and discards such financial information 
						  after processing. </p>
						<p> Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions<br>
						  From time to time, we may request information from you via online polls, surveys, 
						  sweepstakes or contests. Participation in these survey, sweepstakes or contests is 
						  completely voluntary; you have a choice whether or not to disclose information 
						  required to enter. Information requested may include personal contact information 
						  such as your name, shipping and email addresses. Contact information will be used to notify 
						  winners, award prizes and contact users with further information about WWF products 
						  and services, as well as the products and services of WWF partners and third parties. 
						  Survey information will be used for the purposes of monitoring or improving use and 
						  satisfaction of the WWF web site. </p>
						<p> Conservation Action Network<br>
						  WWF's Conservation Action Network (CAN) collects and uses personally identifiable 
						  information in connection with grassroots outreach and advocacy efforts. In order 
						  to use CAN's tools to send emails, faxes, or letters to decision makers, we require a user 
						  to provide a name, mailing address, and email address. Participation in CAN is entirely 
						  voluntary. Information collected is used for the promotion of WWF and CAN 
						  legislative goals, grassroots outreach and policy advocacy. </p>
						<p> Cookies<br>
						  A cookie is a piece of data placed on your hard drive when you visit our site. 
						  We may use cookies to help us recognize you when you come back to our site. We may 
						  also use cookies to help us monitor traffic on our site. This information may be 
						  aggregated in an anonymous manner. You can select to have our web site remember 
						  your email address and password on your specific computer when you login. This 
						  information will be stored in a cookie on your hard drive that will only be used 
						  when you return to the site to login again. </p>
						<p> We may from time to time link cookie information with personally identifiable information 
						  collected from the Conservation Action Network. This will help us better tailor our 
						  site and provide you with offers that we think may be of interest to you. </p>
						<h3>B. Non-personally identifiable information</h3>
						<p> Session Cookies<br>
						  A cookie is a piece of data placed on your hard drive when you visit our site. 
						  We use session cookies to help you navigate through the actions on our site when you 
						  log in, but they contain no personally identifiable information about you. We may 
						  also use cookies to help us monitor traffic on our site. This information may be 
						  aggregated in an anonymous manner. This will help us better tailor our site and provide 
						  you with offers that we think may be of interest to you. </p>
						<p> IP Addresses and Environmental Variables<br>
						  WWF may also collect information through IP addresses or environmental variables. 
						  An "IP address" is a number used by computers on the network to identify your 
						  computer so that data can be transmitted to you. "Environmental variables" include, 
						  among other things, the domain from which you access the Internet, the time you 
						  accessed our web site, type of web browser and operating system or platform used, 
						  the Internet address of the web site you left to visit WWF, the names of the pages 
						  you visit while at our web site, and the Internet address of the web site you 
						  then visit. We collect all of this information to allow us to detect broad demographic 
						  trends, to provide information tailored to your interests and to enhance your 
						  experience on websites operated by WWF. This information may be aggregated in 
						  an anonymous manner. </p>
						<h3><a name="two" id="two">II. HOW INFORMATION MAY BE USED</a></h3>
						<p> We may share personally and non-personally identifiable information with third parties 
						  that help manage our web site and databases and with our partners and affiliates. We will not, 
						  however, share personally identifiable information obtained from activists when they 
						  subscribe to CAN or to send a message to a decision maker using CAN, with the 
						  following two exceptions: (1) when you take action, you will be identified on the 
						  action itself as the sender - for example, in the fax or email sent to the 
						  decision-maker; (2) we may share personally identifiable information with third 
						  parties that help manage our web site and databases, who are subject to a 
						  confidentiality agreement. </p>
						<h3><a name="three" id="three">III. USER CONTROL OVER COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION</a></h3>
						<p> WWF provides you with the following choices regarding the use of your information:<br>
						  You may set your browser to: (1) inform you when cookies are being set before a cookie is 
						  stored; (2) not accept cookies at all; and (3) erase all cookies from your hard drive. 
						  However, if you choose to reject or erase cookies, your ability to navigate our site may be limited. </p>
						<p> You may choose not to provide WWF with any contact information. However, if you do so, 
						  we will be unable to respond to your request for WWF information, enter you in any 
						  sweepstakes or contests, facilitate your action via CAN, or send online postcards. 
						  Additionally, your ability to navigate our site may be limited. </p>
						<p> If you would like to opt-out of receiving some or all further information from WWF, 
						  either (1) take the opportunity to opt out wherever personally identifiable information 
						  is collected, (2) take the opportunity to opt out in links on the bottom of email 
						  we send to you, or (3) go to the Profile Editor tool <a href="http://www.worldwildlife.org/login" target="_blank">www.worldwildlife.org/login</a>. </p>
						<p> If you would like to change or modify information you have previously provided us, 
						  please manage your profile by visiting our web site at <a href="http://www.worldwildlife.org/login" target="_blank">www.worldwildlife.org/login</a>. </p>
						<p> If you have any questions about this privacy policy or the practices of our Web sites, 
						  please contact: <a href="mailto:membership@wwfus.org">membership@wwfus.org</a>. </p>
