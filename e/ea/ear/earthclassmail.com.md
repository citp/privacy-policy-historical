# Privacy Policy | Earth Class Mail

This is the privacy policy of Earth Class Mail, Inc. (ECM) applicable to the website at www.EarthClassMail.com (“the Website”) and, should you become a customer, to our secure hosted software application, which requires registration and payment and may include online postal mail, check processing, or for other mail-related services that we perform (“the Hosted Services”). We take very seriously the jobs of providing high quality service and protecting your privacy. The information below outlines the commitment we have made to protect your privacy. We do reserve the right to change this agreement, but any changes made will be posted here.

ECM adheres to the U.S., EU, and Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks which are administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce. We comply with the Safe Harbor privacy principles of Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity, Access and Enforcement. Details on the frameworks are found at: <http://export.gov/safeharbor/>.

### The Website

We collect limited personal information when you access the Website.

Information you provide – When you visit the publicly-accessible Website, we collect the web page you came from, your browser's user agent string, any keywords you used in a search engine, your computer's IP address, the time and date, the name of the pages your computer visited, and how long it spent on each page.

### ECM cookies

When you visit ECM, we send to your computer one or more cookies - a small file containing a string of characters - that uniquely identify your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service by storing user preferences and tracking user trends. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some ECM features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.

This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this website.

### Partners

We may work with a partner site, such as a vendor, to offer you certain services. The partners do NOT, without your knowledge and consent, collect your identity or contact information from your visits to their websites. We provide information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with ECM under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help ECM communicate with you about offers from ECM and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.

For each visitor to a partner website, the visitor's computer reaches the partner via a particular IP (Internet Protocol) address, and the partner's servers automatically collect this IP address.

Cookies assist partners in tracking your activities from our web site to a partner's web site that you link to from our site. If you re-visit the partner's site directly, the partner is able to continue to track your activities on the site and reward us for referring you. The Cookies themselves tell the partner nothing about you personally.

Cookies are used in two stages of the partner tracking: when a banner image on our site is loaded on your Web page for viewing by you and when you click a banner on our site. The function of these Cookies is to provide the partner with information solely for the purpose of crediting us with referrals.

The partner's servers automatically generate a unique number identifying your visit. No information is obtained from you or your computer to generate your unique identifying number. None of the partner's Cookies are used to perform "User Profiling".

### The Hosted Services

When you sign up for a Hosted Service that requires registration, we ask you for personal information (such as your name, email address, and an account password). For services such as online postal mail, we also request and store credit card or other payment account information, address and telephone information, and physical copies of your identification papers. For services such as check processing and depositing, we will request and store information relating to your banking account. All information will be maintained in encrypted form on secure servers or in secure physical facilities, as appropriate. We may combine the information you submit under your account with information from other ECM services or third parties in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services. For certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt out of combining such information. We do not contact site visitors unless they have given us explicit permission to do so, have written to us, or have begun (or completed) the process of signing up for one of our services. Except in the unlikely event that we are required to do so by law, personal details of your visit to our publicly-accessible website will never be shared with any third party without your permission.

### Log information

When you use ECM services, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.

### User communications

### Affiliated sites

We process such information in accordance with this Policy. The affiliated sites may have different privacy practices and we encourage you to read their privacy policies.

Choices for personal information When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration, we notify you of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy. We also ask you to provide personal information. If we use this information in a manner different from the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use.

If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Policy and/or in the specific service notices, we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes. We will not collect or use sensitive personal information for purposes other than those described in this Policy or the specific service notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent (such as in our service agreements).

  * Please contact us at the address below for any additional questions about the management or use of personal data.



### Information security

We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage, and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.

We restrict access to personal information to ECM employees, contractors, and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.

Earth Class Mail applies rigorous security measures at physical mail facilities, at its data centers, and within the applications that it provides for access to those services.

### Data integrity

ECM processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage, and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store, and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.

### Accessing and updating personal information

When you use our Hosted Services, we make good-faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected, or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our services may have different procedures to access, correct, or delete users' personal information. We may provide the details for these procedures in the specific privacy notices or FAQs for these services.

### Enforcement

Enforcement – Customer Service is staffed to assist and support our customers’ activities and accounts, and also to enforce adherence to our User Agreement terms and conditions. Customer Service can suspend and/or terminate service for any account for breach of those terms or operating in a manner inconsistent with the terms of service. Earth Class Mail’s Human Resources department also works closely with department heads to ensure policies are adhered to and when necessary to terminate employment for any employee, permanent or temporary, that breaches the terms of hire, or presents a security risk.
