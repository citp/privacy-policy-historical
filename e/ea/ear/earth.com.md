**WHAT ARE ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOLS AND COOKIES AND HOW DO WE USE THEM?**

We may store information that we collect through cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or third parties to create profiles of our users. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that detail their viewing preferences. Consequently, collected information is tied to the users’ personally identifiable information to provide offers and improve the content of the Site for the user. This profile is used to tailor a user’s visit to the Site, and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them. We do not share your profile with other third parties.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. We use both session ID cookies [and] persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user’s hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.

We use cookies to enhance the user’s experience on the Site. By setting a cookie on our Site, users would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our Site. If users reject the cookie, they may still use our Site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our Site. For example, the user will not be able to participate in any of our sweepstakes, contests or monthly drawings that take place. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on the Site. 

While we do not offer an opt-out on the Site for cookies, browsers provide you with information and control over cookies. You can set your web browser to alert you when a cookie is being used. You can also get information on the duration of the cookie and what server your data is being returned to. You then have the opportunity to accept or reject the cookie. Additionally, you can set your browser to refuse all cookies or accept only cookies returned to the originating servers. Users can generally disable the cookie feature on their browser without affecting their ability to use the site, except in some cases where cookies are used as an essential security feature necessary for transaction completion.

In the course of serving advertisements to the Site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique “cookie” on your browser.

**How Do We Use Your Data?**

  * **To Engage In Transactions For Service** : Your name, address, email, purchase details, and credit card/payment information may be collected and stored as part of the transaction history and may be used by us to enable us to perform the Services. 
  * **To Provide Future Service And Support.** Information collected for this purpose is both contact data and information related to products and service/support requested. This information is also used to provide service, product updates, and similar notices. 
  * **To Select Content.** Data may be collected to help create web site content and navigation that is most relevant and user friendly. This includes data collected as a result of site navigation, as well as data provided in forms. 
  * **To Respond To User Inquiries And Requests For Information**. This data includes registrations for online newsletters, opt-in mailing lists and specific requests for further information.
  * **To Respond To Regulators.**  Data is used to respond to law enforcement organizations, government officials, or third parties when compelled by subpoena, court order, or applicable law, or to report or prevent suspected fraudulent or illegal activity in the use of the Services. We will notify Customer of the information request or submission as, and if, allowed.
  * **When You Consent to Share Information to/for Relevant Programs or Online Accounts.**   To provide various communities, such as resellers, with relevant product alerts and updates. These updates are related to product releases, prices, terms, special offers and associated campaigns. This data is sent when the program member signs up for the relevant program or online account.
  * **For Earth.com, Inc.’s Marketing to You.** We may use information from user purchases and user-specified requirements to provide you with timely and pertinent notices regarding product releases and service developments that address your needs and specified requirements and/or which are similar to services previously purchased by the user from us.
  * **For Third-Party Advertising to You.  **We may use information derived from cookies or your behavior on the Site to allow us and third parties to target certain ads towards you while you use the Site.  The ads appearing on the Site are delivered to users by our ad serving software. Information about users’ visit to this Site, such as number of times they have viewed an ad (but not user name, address, or other personal information), is used to serve ads to users on this Site. We also use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this Site and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here: [http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp](http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp)
  * **To Place Cookies on Your Browser**.  In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.
  * **To Use Log Files.**  Like most standard web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track users’ movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.  We use a tracking utility called ‘ClickTracks’ that uses log files to analyze user movement.
  * **To Use Clear Gifs.** We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on the Site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. The main difference between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear gifs are not tied to users’ personally identifiable information.  Clear Gifs can “work with” existing cookies on a computer if they are both from the same Site or advertising company. That means, for example, that if a person visited ‘www.companyX.com’, which uses an advertising company’s clear gif, the web site would match the clear gif’s identifier and the advertising company’s cookie ID number, to show the past online behavior for that computer. In addition, we use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If users would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the Opt-out section.


  * **For Special Offers.  **We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections.
  * **For Newsletters.**  If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and email address. 
  * **For Service Announcements.**  On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our Service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. 
  * **For Customer Service.**  We may communicate with you on a regular basis to provide the Services and any other requested services, and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply via email or phone, in accordance with the users wishes.



Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will not transfer information to any of its agents unless it first either ascertains that the agent subscribes to the U.S. Safe Harbor Principles or is subject to the **DP Laws** as defined at the end of this Privacy Policy or another adequacy finding or enters into a written agreement with such agent requiring that the agent provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the relevant U.S. Safe Harbor Principles.
