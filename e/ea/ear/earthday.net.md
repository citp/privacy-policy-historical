# Privacy Policy | Earth Day Network

Earth Day Network respects your right to privacy. Earth Day Network will only collect Personal Information (defined below) that you voluntarily provide to us and will only disclose it or use it for purposes as disclosed in this Privacy Policy or as disclosed by us at the time information is requested from you.

You understand that Earth Day Network will collect and store the data provided in order to communicate with you about our programs and campaigns and that the data will be hosted by Salsa Labs for these purposes. You understand that Earth Day Network is based in the United States and that the European Commission does not consider United States laws to provide an adequate level of data protection. You understand that your consent is the lawful basis for transfer of my personal data to the United States and that you can withdraw your consent at any time. You also understand that the transfer of your personal data to the United States in the absence of adequate protection and without safeguards deemed appropriate by the European Commission may pose certain risks, including that United States law may not provide for data processing principles, data subject rights, or enforcement of those rights analogous to those in the European Union.

**Personal Information**

When you visit our website, Earth Day Network does not automatically collect any information that could personally identify you. Personal information includes your name, street address, email address, billing information, credit card number and expiration date, and any other personally identifying information you may provide (“Personal Information”). Your Personal Information is only collected when you voluntarily submit it, for example, when you order products through the Earth Day Store, subscribe to our newsletter or email updates, participate in online interactive activities (such as chat rooms and bulletin boards), endorse our campaigns, sign up as a volunteer, list your event or group, make a donation, submit content or suggestions, or register for sweepstakes or contests.

In addition to the ways described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy or at the time information is requested, we may use Personal Information received from visitors to our website for any of the following purposes: (1) to confirm, process and fulfill product orders; (2) to award prizes; (3) to respond to specific requests made by the visitor; (4) to demonstrate public support for policy proposals; (5) to provide to other environmental groups for use in collaborative educational and mobilizing efforts seeking to promote responsible environmental attitudes and policies; (6) to obtain parental consent for visitors under eighteen (18) years of age, when necessary; or (7) to protect the security or integrity of our website when necessary.

With the exceptions noted above, any Personal Information received from you will be retained by Earth Day Network and will not be sold, transferred or otherwise disclosed to any third party, unless such disclosure is required by law or court order. In all cases, data will be stored only for as long as it is necessary for the purpose for which it was unless otherwise directed by you.

Earth Day Networks collects and processes your personal information only with your consent. Individuals can always refuse to supply Personal Information, can withdraw their previously-given consent to process such information, and can request access to, or correction or removal of, their personal data, with the caveat that doing so may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities for which their personal information is necessary.

Some of the recipients of your Personal Information may be located outside of your home country. In particular, users in the European Union should be aware that their data will be transferred to the United States and that the European Commission has not found United States law to adequately protect the rights of data subjects. Users in the European Union at have the right to lodge a complaint under the General Data Protection Regulation with their Member State’s supervisory authority.

**Technical Information and Traffic Data**

Each time you come to the Earth Day Network website, our web server (like most on the web) collects some basic technical information, including your IP address, your domain name, referral data (for example, the address of the last URL you were at before clicking through to our website) and browser and platform type (“Technical Information”). Earth Day Network may use this Technical Information to improve our website and make it more responsive to our visitors (see “Cookies” below).
