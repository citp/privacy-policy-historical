It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personally identifiable information and how you can access and update this information.

eBooks.com respects your privacy. As we develop our online presence, we will revise our Privacy Policy to reflect our practices and to meet any legislative or other requirements. The terms of this Privacy Policy form part of and should be read in conjunction with the [Terms of Use and Licenses](https://web.archive.org/information/terms.asp) which govern this Website.

If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at <https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request>

#### Collection of personally identifiable information

Ebooks.com Pty Limited is the sole owner of the information collected on eBooks.com. eBooks.com collects personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on our Web site. 

If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and billing address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). 

We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you. 

After registering an account with us, you will receive an email containing a welcome message and your login details. After successfully completing a purchase, you will receive an email receipt of your order. 

If you purchase a gift certificate from us, we will ask you for the name and email address of the recipient in order to fulfill the purchase request. The information is not used for any other purpose. 

eBooks.com will collect information generated by its webservers for the purpose of assessing the technical performance of its systems and to enhance service levels. 

From time to time, we may also request and you may choose to provide us with personally identifiable information through the use of the Website or through email addresses available from our Website. 

If you do not provide us with the personally identifiable information that we request, we may not be able to properly assess your request for service and the level of service we can provide you may be reduced to the extent that you do not provide us with relevant information. 

We will not collect sensitive information about you from anyone else without your consent.

#### Use and Disclosure of Information 

We will use personally identifiable information you provide to us for the purpose of providing you with the service or product that you have requested. We do not share personally identifiable information with third parties. 

We will not sell, rent, trade, share, reveal or disclose any of your personally identifiable information, unless 

  * you have specifically requested that we do so;
  * we deem it necessary to provide you with services you have requested;
  * required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities 
  * as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, bankruptcy proceedings, or similar legal process;
  * our terms and conditions state that we will;
  * when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request; or
  * We have reason to suspect that unlawful activity has been, is being or may be engaged in and the use or disclosure of your personally identifiable information is a necessary part of our investigation of the matter or in reporting our concerns to relevant persons or authorities. 



We may provide aggregate information and statistics about eBooks.com's customers, sales traffic patterns and related site information to third parties but these statistics will not include individual personally identifiable information.

Only a few individuals within the company are given degrees of access to customers' personally identifiable information according to job function and necessity. Access is granted to these employees through special passwords. All employees are kept up to date on our security and privacy practices.

#### Tell-a-Friend

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Ebooks.com does not store this information. 

#### eBooks.com acts as agent

In addition to operating as an online retailer of ebooks in its own right, eBooks.com also provides sales, fulfillment, payment processing and help-desk services to other companies on an agency basis. This service is most commonly provided to book publishers. We will make it clear to you whenever we are so acting as an agent, by showing the brand of the other company at the top of our web pages. The other company's brand will be followed by the words "Powered by eBooks.com" or similar. When we sell you an ebook in our capacity as agent, the vendor of record for that purchase will be the other company. When so acting as an agent, we may provide to the other company your personally identifiable information, so that they may continue to service your needs in the event that the partnership between eBooks.com and the other company ceases. If you opt-in to receive marketing information we may pass your information onto our partners, whom we act as agents, so they may continue that service. If you do not want us to share your personally identifiable information with these companies, contact us at privacy@ebooks.com

This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Web site.

#### Social Media Widgets

Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button and Widgets, such as Twitter and Blogspot or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it. 

#### Changes to Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page prior to the change becoming effective.

#### Cookies

Our site uses cookies to keep track of your visits to our website. A cookie is a small file that can be stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. We may use these to do a number of things:

  * We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interest and to save your password so that you don't have to re-enter it every time you visit our site.
  * Cookies help us to recognise when you next visit our website and note the recommendations displayed to you. This allows us to tailor the service we provide to your preferences.



You can usually change your browser so that it will not accept cookies. If you'd like to learn more about cookies in general and how to manage them, visit [www.aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/)

#### What Are Cookies?

eBooks.com places tiny text files called cookies onto your computer, tablet or mobile device. This is standard practice for almost all websites.

Cookies are not harmful to your computer and are an essential part of online shopping. They allow us to give you a more efficient customer experience.

#### What Are Cookies Used For?

There are two main types of cookie; we call them "first party" and "third party" cookies.

First party cookies are small data files that we use for things such as keeping track of what you've put in your basket and remembering who you are when you return to our site. We don't save personal information such as credit card details in the cookies we create.

Third party cookies are set on our behalf. The most important of these are Google and Commission Junction, who display text or banner adverts on our behalf on a number of other reputable websites or in Internet search results. Commission Junction does not collect personal data from our website. Because our website uses Google Analytics to help us optimise our web pages and better understand the website’s traffic, if you visit us while you’re logged in to your Google account (like Gmail, for example) then some of your browsing activity on our site may be …
