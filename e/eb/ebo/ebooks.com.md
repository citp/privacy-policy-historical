TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. This privacy statement covers the site [eBooks.com](http://www.ebooks.com/). Because this web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact Customer Service by email at privacy@ebooks.com. If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe (<http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php>). TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with the Web site to resolve your concerns.

The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this Web site, and does not cover information that may be collected through software downloaded from the site.

eBooks.com respects your privacy. As we develop our online presence, we will revise our Privacy Policy to reflect our practices and to meet any legislative or other requirements. The terms of this Privacy Policy form part of and should be read in conjunction with the [Terms of Use and Licenses](https://web.archive.org/information/terms.asp) which govern this Website.   


##### Collection of Personal Information

eBooks Corporation is the sole owner of the information collected on eBooks.com. eBooks Corporation collects personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on our Web site.

If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and billing address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date).

We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.

After registering an account with us, you will receive an email containing a welcome message and your login details. After successfully completing a purchase, you will receive an email receipt of your order.

If you purchase a gift certificate from us, we will ask you for the name and email address of the recipient in order to fulfill the purchase request. The information is not used for any other purpose.

eBooks.com will collect information generated by its webservers for the purpose of assessing the technical performance of its systems and to enhance service levels. 

From time to time, we may also request and you may choose to provide us with personal information through the use of the Website or through email addresses available from our Website. 

If you do not provide us with the personal information that we request, we may not be able to properly assess your request for service and the level of service we can provide you may be reduced to the extent that you do not provide us with relevant information. 

We will not collect sensitive information about you from anyone else without your consent.

##### Use and Disclosure of Information 

We will use personal information you provide to us for the purpose of providing you with the service or product that you have requested. We do not share personally identifiable information with third parties.

We will not sell, rent, trade, share, reveal or disclose any of your personal information, unless 

  * you have specifically requested that we do so;
  * we deem it necessary to provide you with services you have requested;
  * we are required to do so by a Court of competent jurisdiction or by a governmental order, decree, regulation or rule of any regulatory agency;
  * our terms and conditions state that we will;
  * we reasonably believe that use of disclosure is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to an individual's life, health or safety or a serious threat to public health or safety; or 
  * We have reason to suspect that unlawful activity has been, is being or may be engaged in and the use or disclosure of your personal information is a necessary part of our investigation of the matter or in reporting our concerns to relevant persons or authorities. 



We may provide aggregate information and statistics about eBooks.com's customers, sales traffic patterns and related site information to third parties but these statistics will not include individual personal information.

If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may update it by logging in to your account or by emailng Customer Support at privacy@ebooks.com or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below. 

##### Choice/Opt Out

We provide you the opportunity to "opt-out" of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, if you create an account but do not wish to receive any additional marketing/promotional material from us, you can indicate your preference on our registration form. Customers may not opt-out of purchase receipts and confirmation emails as these are obligatory.

If you sign up for our email alerts, notifying you of new book releases, and you no longer wish to receive our alerts and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us at privacy@ebooks.com. 

You will be notified when your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party.
