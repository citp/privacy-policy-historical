## Collection of Personal Information

eBooks.com is the sole owner of the information collected on eBooks.com. eBooks.com collects personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on our Web site.

If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and billing address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date).

We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.

After registering an account with us, you will receive an email containing a welcome message and your login details. After successfully completing a purchase, you will receive an email receipt of your order.

If you purchase a gift certificate from us, we will ask you for the name and email address of the recipient in order to fulfill the purchase request. The information is not used for any other purpose.

eBooks.com will collect information generated by its webservers for the purpose of assessing the technical performance of its systems and to enhance service levels. 

From time to time, we may also request and you may choose to provide us with personal information through the use of the Website or through email addresses available from our Website. 

If you do not provide us with the personal information that we request, we may not be able to properly assess your request for service and the level of service we can provide you may be reduced to the extent that you do not provide us with relevant information. 

We will not collect sensitive information about you from anyone else without your consent.

## Use and Disclosure of Information 

We will use personal information you provide to us for the purpose of providing you with the service or product that you have requested. We do not share personally identifiable information with third parties.

We will not sell, rent, trade, share, reveal or disclose any of your personal information, unless 

  * you have specifically requested that we do so;
  * we deem it necessary to provide you with services you have requested;
  * we are required to do so by a Court of competent jurisdiction or by a governmental order, decree, regulation or rule of any regulatory agency;
  * our terms and conditions state that we will;
  * we reasonably believe that use of disclosure is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to an individual's life, health or safety or a serious threat to public health or safety; or 
  * We have reason to suspect that unlawful activity has been, is being or may be engaged in and the use or disclosure of your personal information is a necessary part of our investigation of the matter or in reporting our concerns to relevant persons or authorities.

## Cookies

Cookies are pieces of information that a website can transfer to an individual's web browser on their computer hard drive for record keeping.

## Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)

We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), in conjunction with cookies to help us better manage affiliate referrals. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information. 

## Access to Personally Identifiable Information

If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may update it by logging in to your account or by emailng Customer Support at privacy@ebooks.com or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below. 

## Choice/Opt Out

We provide you the opportunity to "opt-out" of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, if you create an account but do not wish to receive any additional marketing/promotional material from us, you can indicate your preference on our registration form. Customers may not opt-out of purchase receipts and confirmation emails as these are obligatory.

If you sign up for our email alerts, notifying you of new book releases, and you no longer wish to receive our alerts and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us at privacy@ebooks.com. 

You will be notified when your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party. 

## Data Security

Only a few individuals within the company are given degrees of access to customers' personal information according to job function and necessity. Access is granted to these employees through special passwords. All employees are kept up to date on our security and privacy practices. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure, guarded environment.

## TELL-A-FRIEND

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Ebooks.com does not store this information. 

## eBooks.com acts as agent

In addition to operating as an online retailer of ebooks in its own right, eBooks.com also provides sales, fulfillment, payment processing and help-desk services to other companies on an agency basis. This service is most commonly provided to book publishers. We will make it clear to you whenever we are so acting as an agent, by showing the brand of the other company at the top of our web pages. The other company's brand will be followed by the words "Powered by eBooks.com" or similar. When we sell you an ebook in our capacity as agent, the vendor of record for that purchase will be the other company. When so acting as an agent, we may provide to the other company your personal information, so that they may continue to service your needs in the event that the partnership between eBooks.com and the other company ceases. If you opt-in to receive marketing information we may pass your information onto our partners, whom we act as agents, so they may continue that service. We will not supply your personal information to any third party whose own privacy policy is less stringent than our own. 

## Links to Other Sites

This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by eBooks.com. Please be aware that we, eBooks.com, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.

We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information.

This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Web site.

## Changes to Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page. 

## Business Transitions

In the event that eBooks.com goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via a notice on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.
