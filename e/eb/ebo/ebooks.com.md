## eBooks.com acts as agent

In addition to operating as an online retailer of ebooks in its own right, eBooks.com also provides sales, fulfillment, payment processing and help-desk services to other companies on an agency basis. This service is most commonly provided to book publishers. We will make it clear to you whenever we are so acting as an agent, by showing the brand of the other company at the top of our web pages. The other company's brand will be followed by the words "Powered by eBooks.com" or similar. When we sell you an ebook in our capacity as agent, the vendor of record for that purchase will be the other company. When so acting as an agent, we may provide to the other company your personally identifiable information, so that they may continue to service your needs in the event that the partnership between eBooks.com and the other company ceases. If you opt-in to receive marketing information we may pass your information onto our partners, whom we act as agents, so they may continue that service.
