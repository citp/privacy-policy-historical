<p>From time to time, we may disclose your Personal Information as follows:</p>

<li>To organizations that perform services for or on behalf of ebookers, for example to provide customer service, deliver tickets, ship items, process credit cards, for research, marketing, data processing, to measure the use of our Website or to facilitate usage by a Visitor. We will share with these companies only that Personal Information which they need to work on our behalf. Some of these service providers may be located in countries outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). Your Personal Information will be provided to these organizations only if they agree to use such information solely for the purpose of providing services to ebookers, and under the instructions of ebookers, and with respect to that information, to act in a manner consistent with the relevant principles articulated in this Policy. <strong>By submitting your Personal Information, you agree to the transfer, storing and processing of your data outside the EEA.</strong></li>

<p>This policy will not cover the use of your Personal Information by these other companies. We encourage you to read a company's privacy policy before requesting any of its products or services.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Please note that there are circumstances where the use or disclosure of Personal Information may be justified or permitted, or where ebookers may be obligated to disclose information without consent. Such circumstances may include:</strong></span></p>
<ul>

<li>Where the information is public.</li>
<li>To our insurers and to regulatory agencies.</li>
<li>If required to comply with an order or warrant issued or an order made by a court, person or body with jurisdiction to compel the production of information, or to comply with the rules or court relating to the production of records.</li>
<li>If we believe in good faith that a law, regulation, rule or guideline requires it.</li>
<li>To a person who needs the information because of an emergency that threatens the life, health, or security of an identifiable person or group.</li>
<li>Where it is necessary to collect monies owing to us.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Security</strong></h3>
<p>In order to protect national security, and to ensure travel security, National Governments may request access to passenger name records, which typically includes name, flight origin, flight destination, flight time, duration of flight, seat location, travel agent, form of payment, credit card numbers, travel itinerary, address, telephone number and meal requests. In response to such request, ebookers and/or its providers will give access to all the information you provide at the time of making your reservation to the applicable government agencies of the countries to or from which you are travelling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Third Parties' Personal Information</strong></h3>
<p>We will retain in your My Stuff folder the Personal Information of individuals for whom you have made reservations.</p>
<p>You can access, modify, or delete these third parties' Personal Information at any time, as described in Paragraph 8 below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Retention and storage</strong></h3>
<p>We will retain your Personal Information in our databases in accordance with our document management, retention and destruction policy and applicable laws. This period may extend beyond the end of your relationship with us, but it will be only as long as it is necessary for us to have sufficient information to respond to any issues that may arise later. For example, we may need or be required to retain information to allow you to obtain credit for the trip you Purchased but had to cancel. We may also need the retain certain information to prevent fraudulent activity; to protect ourselves against liability, permit us to pursue available remedies or limit any damages that we may sustain; or if we believe in good faith that a law, regulation, rule or guideline requires it.</p>
<p>Your Personal Information will be stored in secured locations, and on servers controlled by ebookers, located either at our offices, or at the offices of our service providers, as described below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>7. How we protect Personal Information</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ebookers employs physical, administrative and technical safeguards to help protect the confidentiality and integrity of Personal Information and to reduce the risk of loss, misuse, unauthorized access disclosure or modification of Personal Information. When Personal Information is sent to our service providers, we require, in our contracts with them, that they protect all Personal Information in a manner consistent with the principles articulated in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you choose to contact ebookers through the Website, you should be aware that any information transmitted electronically via the World Wide Web might not be secure. ebookers assumes no liability for the loss of any information that you transmit to us via the World Wide Web. However, should you choose to pay by credit card when making a booking, reservation or purchase on the Website, your card details are encrypted for the transaction.</p>
<p>In communicating with you, we may send email as unencrypted plain text because we are aware that most Members, Guests, or Subscribers cannot readily process encrypted email. This is done for your convenience, but with the security concern that, if misrouted or intercepted, it could be read more easily than encrypted email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>8. How to access, modify or delete your Personal Information</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We endeavour to ensure that Personal Information is as accurate, complete, and current as necessary for the purposes for which we use that information. We encourage you to visit you’re My Stuff folder to review your Personal Information</p>
<p>You can access your Personal Information in My Stuff, update it, correct it, or modify it, as necessary. For example, you can change at any time your email address, preferred activities, or preferred destinations, or your preferences for receiving or not receiving our emails, e-newsletters, or instant messaging customised advertisements.</p>
<p>If you wish to modify or delete other Personal Information, you can do so by contacting us as indicated below. If you request that we remove all of the Personal Information or travel records stored in My Stuff, we will promptly do so, to the extent possible. Once required Personal Information is removed from My Stuff, however, you will not be able to use many of the services available on our Website to Members, unless you re-register. Please remember that we may not be able to honour your request if we are legally obligated to retain that information, or for other reasons, as described in our Retention and Storage policy above.</p>
