<h2 class="section-headline">What is the Ebola Play?</h2>
</header>
<article>
<p>Ebola Play is an ad network operated by E-BOLA Média Kft., which predominantly publishes advertisements and other promotional materials on the basis of assignments of advertisers contracted to our company. Such content is chiefly published on websites that are operated by other companies, the owners or operators of those websites are registered as publishers on the website of Ebola and are members of the ad network of Ebola Play.</p>

<h2 class="section-headline">Our Privacy Policy</h2>
</header>
<article>
<p>It is of the utmost importance to note that the scope of information we collect and use and the way in which such data is used may vary depending on what services you use; therefore, our information collection is essentially based on two separate systems, both relying on different principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>Should you visit any of the websites managed by Ebola or alternatively, view an advertisement or content that is published in the framework of the Ebola Play service, Ebola will not collect any personal data or information from or about you from which you can be identified. In this case, Ebola may exclusively collect non-personally identifiable, anonymous information about the use of the specific website, e.g. relating to the content you view in the framework of Ebola Play (without any direct identification) or the advertisements you click on etc. For detailed information please visit link to <a id="privacy-information-link">the privacy information below</a>.</li>
<li>2. Should you wish to use Ebola’s services as a publisher, you must first register on the Ebola Play website and give the basic personal details required there (for further details please read the Privacy Policy). In this case, data you have provided will be used to the extent required by the service to be provided by us and on the basis of your explicit consent. For detailed information please visit link to <a id="privacy-policy-link">the privacy policy below</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have any questions in connection with the above-mentioned information collection, please contact us any time using the email address <a href="mailto:info@ebolaplay.com">info@ebolaplay.com</a>.</p>
<p>Ebola reserves the right to amend, at any time, unilaterally, its Privacy Policy and Rules, in accordance with the governing law. In the case of such an event, the details of all amendments will be published on our website.</p>

<div class="privacy-section">
<section>
<header>
<h2 class="section-headline">What data is collected in relation to the use of the websites and the Ebola Play content located on the websites?</h2>
</header>
<article>
<p>If you do not use Ebola’s other services in the framework of which, based on your voluntary choice, you explicitly give personal data relevant to you, Ebola will not collect or process any personal information on you.</p>
<p>However, upon visiting the websites operated by Ebola (in particular, www.ebolaplay.com, www.ebolamedia.com and vid4u.org), and websites embedding the Ebola Play that are operated by a third party which is a member of the ad network (jointly referred to as <b>“Websites”</b>) and by downloading and viewing the specific content, you give consent to the service provider E-BOLA Média Kft. (registered office: 1026 Budapest, Riadó u. 7.) to collect data and information given in this privacy policy (<b>“Privacy Policy”</b>) and to locate cookies required for the recording.</p>
<p>Such information includes data from your PC that is generated whilst using the Websites and the services of the Ebola Play, this is automatically recorded by the system of the service provider as an result of technical processes.</p>
<p>Unless you have disabled cookies on your PC, the data which is recorded automatically will be automatically logged at the start up of the specific Ebola Play content and at the time of exiting the Websites.</p>
<p>Such data include:</p>
<p><b>Cookies:</b> cookies are short text files that are placed on the hard disk of the user’s PC by the website and include information about the user. For example, if a user clicks on an advertisement published on a specific publisher website in the framework of the Ebola Play, the website may place a cookie on the user’s PC, which records the specific advertisement as a preference. When the user visits that publisher website at a later time, the content displayed there will be compiled in accordance with the preferences relating to the commercial video which was viewed earlier.</p>
<p><b>Web beacons</b> (also called GIF files, pixels or Internet tags): such data is used by the website to follow up visits on the specific website, so that the service provider can obtain general information about the user’s online surfing.</p>
<p><b>Log files:</b> the internet browser also transfers certain data to the website automatically, such as the IP address of the user’s PC (e.g. 110.256.55.01), the name of the domain from which the user visited the website as well as the subsites visited by the user within the website and also the content viewed on the website. Like all other Internet service providers, Ebola also analyses this data so that it can determine which areas of the publisher websites might be more popular than the others.</p>
<p><b>Viewing data of contents distributed via the Ebola Play network.</b> In order to provide service to the users in an appropriate manner, Ebola analyses the viewing data of the content distributed via Ebola Play, and collects anonymous data relating to the ratings of the specific content through an IT procedure specifically developed for this purpose.</p>
</article>
</section>
<section>
<header>
<h2 class="section-headline">How is information used?</h2>
</header>
<article>
<p>Data collected using the techniques mentioned above cannot be used to identify the user; neither does Ebola link such data with other data so it can be used for identification.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of the use of such data is to allow Ebola to provide the Ebola Play service in an effective and appropriate manner, this requires the follow-up of ratings relating to the content distributed via the Ebola Play, and screening possible abuses in connection with it. Ebola may also use the data specified in this Privacy Policy, among others, to note your personal preferences (e.g. content viewed mostly via the Ebola Play), accordingly, like other service providers. Ebola may also use such data to form the advertisement related experience according to the user’s demands (as previously stated, this is accomplished without the identification of the user).</p>
<p>In addition to the above, Ebola may use that information to analyse use related tendencies and to accomplish advertising purposes achievable through the service, in particular, to transfer advertisements disseminated in the framework of the Ebola Play to the most appropriate and targeted consumers, to improve and develop the service and the function of the Ebola’ website and also to obtain comprehensive data regarding the traffic on the Websites and the entire use of the Ebola Play service. </p>
<p>Ebola may use data obtained in this way to make and analyse statistics on the use of the Websites and the Ebola Play and to transfer statistical data that cannot be used for identification (e.g. number of visitors, the most popular topics and content) to a third party, in particular to companies advertising through the Ebola Play. In addition, Ebola may also publish a summary of such anonymous data.</p>

<h2 class="section-headline">What options do you have? Disabling Cookies:</h2>
</header>
<article>

It is also possible to modify the settings of the cookie messages in another way. </p>
<p>In doing so you will accept that advertisements are still displayed on the Websites, however those ads will not be selected according to your preferences. Furthermore, you acknowledge that all those included in this category will be without prejudice towards Ebola’s right to collect anonymous data using an IT procedure developed for this purpose. This data, due to it’s connection to the ratings of specific Ebola Play content, is required in order to allow Ebola to provide it’s services in conformity with it’s contracts.</p>

<h2 class="section-headline">Cookies placed by third parties:</h2>
