            <h3 id="information">Information we collect and how we use it</h3>
            <p>We offer a number of services that do not require you to register for an   account or provide any personal information to us, such as Eboundservices Search. In   order to provide our full range of services, we may collect the following types   of information: </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Information you provide</strong> – When you sign up for a <a href="privacy_faq.html#toc-terms-account">Eboundservices Account</a> or other Eboundservices   service or promotion that requires registration, we ask you for personal   information (such as your name, email address and an account password). For   certain services, such as our advertising programs, we also request credit card   or other payment account information which we maintain in encrypted form on   secure servers. We may combine the information you submit under your account   with information from other Eboundservices services or third parties in order to provide   you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services. For   certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt out of combining such   information. </li>
              <li><strong>Cookies</strong> – When you visit Eboundservices, we send one or more   cookies – a small file containing a string of characters – to your computer or   other device that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies to improve   the quality of our service, including for storing user preferences, improving   search results and ad selection, and tracking user trends, such as how people   search. Eboundservices also uses cookies in its advertising services to help advertisers   and publishers serve and manage ads across the web. We may set one or more   cookies in your browser when you visit a website, including Eboundservices sites that   use our advertising cookies, and view or click on an ad supported by Eboundservices’s   advertising services. </li>
              <li><strong>Log information</strong> – When you access Eboundservices services, our   servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you   visit a website. These <a href="privacy_faq.html#toc-terms-server-logs">server   logs</a> may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol   address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and   one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. </li>
              <li><strong>User communications</strong> – When you send email or other   communications to Eboundservices, we may retain those communications in order to process   your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services. </li>
              <li><strong>Affiliated Eboundservices Services on other sites</strong> – We offer some   of our services on or through other web sites. Personal information that you   provide to those sites may be sent to Eboundservices in order to deliver the service. We   process such information under this Privacy Policy. The affiliated sites through   which our services are offered may have different privacy practices and we   encourage you to read their privacy policies. </li>
              <li><strong>Gadgets</strong> – Eboundservices may make available third party   applications through its services. The information collected by Eboundservices when you   enable a gadget or other application is processed under this Privacy   Policy.&nbsp;Information collected by the application or gadget provider is governed   by their privacy policies. </li>
              <li><strong>Location data</strong> – Eboundservices offers location-enabled services,   such as Eboundservices Maps for mobile. If you use those services, Eboundservices may receive   information about your actual location (such as GPS signals sent by a mobile   device) or information that can be used to approximate a location (such as a   cell ID). </li>
              <li><strong>Links</strong> – Eboundservices may present links in a format that enables   us to keep track of whether these links have been followed. We use this   information to improve the quality of our search technology, customized content   and advertising. Read more information about <a href="privacy_faq.html#toc-terms-urls">links and redirected URLs</a>. </li>
              <li><strong>Other sites</strong> – This Privacy Policy applies to Eboundservices   services only. We do not exercise control over the sites displayed as search   results, sites that include Eboundservices applications, products or services, or links   from within our various services. These other sites may place their own cookies   or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information   from you. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Eboundservices only processes personal information for the purposes described in this   Privacy Policy and/or the supplementary privacy notices for specific services.   In addition to the above, such purposes include: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Providing our services, including the display of customized content and   advertising; </li>
              <li>Auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve   our services; </li>
              <li>Ensuring the technical functioning of our network; </li>
              <li>Protecting the rights or property of Eboundservices or our users; and </li>
              <li>Developing new services. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can find more information about how we process personal information by   referring to the supplementary privacy notices for particular services. </p>
            <p>Eboundservices processes personal information on our servers in the United States of   America and in other countries. In some cases, we process personal information   on a server outside your own country. We may process personal information to   provide our own services. In some cases, we may process personal information on   behalf of and according to the instructions of a third party, such as our   advertising partners. </p>
            <h3 id="infochoices">Choices for personal information</h3>
            <p>When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration, we ask   you to provide personal information. If we use this information in a manner   different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your   consent prior to such use. </p>
            <p>If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those   described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the specific service privacy notices,   we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal information   for those other purposes. We will not collect or use <a href="privacy_faq.html#toc-terms-sensitive-info">sensitive information</a> for   purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the   supplementary service privacy notices, unless we have obtained your prior   consent. </p>
            <p>Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your   browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.   However, some Eboundservices features and services may not function properly if your   cookies are disabled. </p>
            <p>Eboundservices uses the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx">DoubleClick   advertising cookie</a> on AdSense partner sites and certain Eboundservices services to   help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads across the web. You can   view, edit, and manage your ads preferences associated with this cookie by   accessing the <a href="/ads/preferences/">Ads Preferences Manager</a>. In   addition, you may choose to opt out of the DoubleClick cookie at any time by   using <a href="privacy_ads.html">DoubleClick’s opt-out cookie</a>. </p>
            <p>You can decline to submit personal information to any of our services, in   which case Eboundservices may not be able to provide those services to you. </p>
            <h3 id="infosharing">Information sharing</h3>
            <p>Eboundservices only shares personal information with other companies or individuals   outside of Eboundservices in the following limited circumstances: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any   sensitive personal information. </li>
              <li>We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or   other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal   information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such   information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy   and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. </li>
              <li>We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of   such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law,   regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce   applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations   thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical   issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Eboundservices,   its users or the public as required or permitted by law. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>If Eboundservices becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of   some or all of its assets, we will ensure the confidentiality of any personal   information involved in such transactions and provide notice before personal   information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. </p>
            <p>We may share with third parties certain pieces of <a href="privacy_faq.html#toc-terms-aggregated-info">aggregated, non-personal   information</a>, such as the number of users who searched for a particular term,   for example, or how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. Such   information does not identify you individually. </p>
            <p>Please contact us at the address below for any additional questions about the   management or use of personal data. </p>
            <h3 id="infosecurity">Information security</h3>
            <p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access   to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include   internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and   security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against   unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. </p>
            <p>We restrict access to personal information to Eboundservices employees, contractors   and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or   improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations   and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal   prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. </p>
            <h3 id="dataintegrity">Data integrity</h3>
            <p>Eboundservices processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was   collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy or any applicable   service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and   processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the   personal information needed to provide or improve our services or as otherwise   permitted under this Policy. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the   personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we   depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever   necessary. </p>
            <h3 id="access">Accessing and updating personal information</h3>
            <p>When you use Eboundservices services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with   access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is   inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise   required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask   individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be   accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may   decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic,   require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or   would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information   residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any   case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service   free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Some   of our services have different procedures to access, correct or delete users’   personal information. We provide the details for these procedures in the   specific privacy notices or FAQs for these services. </p>
            <h3 id="enforcement">Enforcement</h3>
            <p>Eboundservices regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. Please feel   free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or   Eboundservices’s treatment of personal information by <a href="/support/bin/request.py?form_type=user&amp;stage=fm&amp;user_type=user&amp;contact_type=privacy&amp;hl=en">contacting   us</a> through this web site or by writing to us at </p>

            </address>
            <h3 id="policychanges">Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will   not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent,   and we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any   Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will   provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email   notification of Privacy Policy changes). Each version of this Privacy Policy   will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date, and we will   also keep <a href="privacy_archive.html">prior versions</a> of this Privacy   Policy in an archive for your review. </p>
