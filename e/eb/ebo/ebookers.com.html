tickets, ship items, process credit cards, for research, marketing, data
processing, to measure the use of our Website or to facilitate usage by a
Visitor. We will share with these companies only that Personal Information
which they need to work on our behalf. Some of these service providers may be
located in countries outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). Your
Personal Information will be provided to these organizations only if they agree
to use such information solely for the purpose of providing services to ebookers&nbsp;, and under the instructions of ebookers&nbsp;, and with respect to that information, to act in a
manner consistent with the relevant principles articulated in this Policy. By
submitting your Personal Information, you agree to the transfer, storing and
processing of your data outside the EEA.</li>

<li>We may collaborate with other companies to offer you
additional Products or Services, for example, through promotions, competitions
and prizedraws. We will share Personal Information that is necessary for these
other companies to provide the Products or Services that you have
requested.</li>

<li>Your Personal Information (including credit or debit
card information) will be transferred to ‘Shopper Discounts &amp; Rewards’

process detailed below:</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Clicking the ‘CONTINUE’ button on the discount voucher

booking on the ebookers’ website; and</li>

<li>Providing and confirming your email address and last
four digits of your credit/debit card on the subsequently-displayed ‘Shopper
Discounts and Rewards’ webpage, and completing your consent to the transfer by
clicking the submission button.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you consent as
set out above, your Personal Information will be subject to Webloyalty’s
privacy policy, which is accessible from <a href="http://www.shopperdiscountsandrewards.co.uk/Features/Common/PrivacyPolicy.rails" target="_parent">
http://www.shopperdiscountsandrewards.co.uk/Features/Common/PrivacyPolicy.rails</a>.
We strongly advise you to read Webloyalty’s privacy policy and satisfy yourself
as to the purposes for which Webloyalty will use your Personal Information
before agreeing to their terms &amp; conditions, as we have no responsibility

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This policy will
not cover the use of your Personal Information by these other companies. We
encourage you to read a company's privacy policy before requesting any of its
products or services.</p>

<p><strong>Please
note that there are circumstances where the use or disclosure of Personal
Information may be justified or permitted, or where ebookers&nbsp;may be obligated to disclose information without
consent. Such circumstances may include:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>To protect our Website and our rights under our
website terms and conditions of use; to protect ourselves against liability or
prevent fraudulent activity; or where it is necessary to permit us to pursue
available remedies or limit any damages that we may sustain.</li>

<li>To effect a corporate transaction, in connection with
the sale, merger, spin-off, or other corporate reorganization of our
corporation, where the information is provided to the new controlling entity in
regular course of business.</li>

<li>Where the information is public.</li>

<li>To our insurers and to regulatory agencies.</li>

<li>If required to comply with an order or warrant issued
or an order made by a court, person or body with jurisdiction to compel the
production of information, or to comply with the rules or court relating to the
production of records.</li>

<li>If we believe in good faith that a law, regulation,
rule or guideline requires it.</li>

<li>To a person who needs the information because of an
emergency that threatens the life, health, or security of an identifiable
person or group.</li>

<li>Where it is necessary to collect monies owing to
us.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Security</strong></p>

<p>In order to
protect national security, and to ensure travel security, the United States
Government and other governments may request access to passenger name records,
which typically includes name, flight origin, flight destination, flight time,
duration of flight, seat location, travel agent, form of payment, credit card
numbers, travel itinerary, address, telephone number and meal requests. In
response to such request, ebookers&nbsp;and/or its providers will give access to all the
information you provide at the time of making your reservation to the
applicable government agencies of the countries to or from which you are
travelling</p>

<p><strong>6. How we
retain and store Personal information</strong></p>

<p>My Account
contains your name, email address, password, and departure city from which you
usually travel. It may also contain other information so that you do not need
to re-enter it each time you Purchase a Product or Service. For example, My

it. It may also contain your preferences for seat selection or special meals,
details about your participation in loyalty or awards programs and applicable
membership numbers, and other travel preferences.</p>

<p>We also keep in My
Account all other information that you have elected to provide us, such as
gender, favourite activities and lifestyle preferences, and favourite
destinations.</p>

<p>My Account also
contains a listing of the emails, e-newsletters and other communications we
offer to send, and that you have elected to receive or not.</p>

<p>You can access,
modify, or delete this Personal Information from time to time as described in
paragraph 8 below.</p>

<p><strong>Third
Parties' Personal Information</strong></p>

<p>We will retain in
you’re My Stuff folder the Personal Information of individuals for whom you
have made reservations.</p>

<p>You can access,
modify, or delete these third parties' Personal Information at any time, as
described in Paragraph 8 below.</p>

<p><strong>Retention
and storage</strong></p>

<p>We will retain
your Personal Information in our databases in accordance with our document
management, retention and destruction policy and applicable laws. This period
may extend beyond the end of your relationship with us, but it will be only as
long as it is necessary for us to have sufficient information to respond to any
issues that may arise later. For example, we may need or be required to retain
information to allow you to obtain credit for a trip you Purchased but had to
cancel. We may also need the retain certain information to prevent fraudulent
activity; to protect ourselves against liability, permit us to pursue available
remedies or limit any damages that we may sustain; or if we believe in good

<p>Your Personal

our service providers, as described below.</p>

<p><strong>7. How we
protect Personal Information</strong></p>

<p>ebookers&nbsp;employs physical, administrative and technical
safeguards to help protect the confidentiality and integrity of Personal
Information and to reduce the risk of loss, misuse, unauthorized access
disclosure or modification of Personal Information. When Personal Information
is sent to our service providers, we require, in our contracts with them, that
they protect all Personal Information in a manner consistent with the
principles articulated in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>If you choose to
contact ebookers&nbsp;through the Website, you should be aware that any
information transmitted electronically via the World Wide Web might not be
secure. ebookers&nbsp;assumes no liability for the loss of any information
that you transmit to us via the World Wide Web. However, should you choose to
pay by credit card when making a booking, reservation or purchase on the
Website, your card details are encrypted for the transaction.</p>

<p>In communicating
with you, we may send email as unencrypted plain text because we are aware that
most Members, Guests, or Subscribers cannot readily process encrypted email.
This is done for your convenience, but with the security concern that, if
misrouted or intercepted, it could be read more easily than encrypted
email.</p>

<p><strong>8. How to
access, modify or delete your Personal Information</strong></p>

ensure that Personal Information is as accurate, complete, and current as
necessary for the purposes for which we use that information. We encourage you

customized advertisements.</p>

<p>If you wish to
modify or delete other Personal Information, you can do so by contacting us as
indicated below. If you request that we remove all of the Personal Information
or travel records stored in My Stuff, we will promptly do so, to the extent
possible. Once required Personal Information is removed from My Stuff, however,
you will not be able to use many of the services available on our Website to
