## Cookies

### What is a cookie?

A cookie is a small amount of data that a website places on the user’s computer.

### Why do websites use cookies?

Websites have no memory. A user who browses from page to page within a website is not recognised as being the same user. Cookies enable the website to recognise the user's browser so that it can therefore remember the choices previously made (e.g. the language spoken by the user) or identify frequent visitors to the site.

### Do cookies all do the same thing?

No, there are different types of cookies that have different purposes. Cookies can be distinguished by their function, lifetime and the web server that places them.

### How does ebooking.com use cookies?

ebooking.com has created an advanced and user-friendly website that automatically adapts to the needs and wishes of its users. To this end, our website uses 4 types of cookies: Technical cookies: Technical cookies show users around our website, they make it work correctly, enable users to create an account, log in and process bookings. Technical cookies are absolutely essential for our website to function properly. Functional cookies: Functional cookies remind the website about a user’s preferences and help them use our website efficiently and effectively; they remind the website about the user’s preferred currency and language, about their previous searches or the accommodation viewed earlier. These functional cookies are not essential for the functioning of our website, but they do make using the website easier and they enhance users’ experience of such. Analytical cookies help us determine how our website is used by visitors, what works and what doesn’t; they enable us to optimise and improve the website and ensure that it continues to be interesting and relevant for our users. We collect data on the web pages viewed, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp information and other details like the number of (mouse) clicks on a given page, mouse movements, scrolling activity, the (search) words used and the text typed while using our website. This information is anonymous and is only used for statistics. Lastly, commercial cookies are used to display ebooking.com advertisements on other websites (retargeting), according to the destinations previously searched for, or accommodation viewed earlier. These cookies are typically placed by trustworthy third parties.

### How long do ebooking.com cookies stay active?

ebooking.com uses several cookies, whose lifespan varies. The maximum lifespan set on some of them is 5 years. All cookies can be deleted from the browser at any given time.

Most of these companies are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and/or the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB). Members of NAI and IAB adhere to industrial standards and codes of conduct. The NAI and IAB members have a general opt-out function for behavioural advertising. Please visit www.networkadvertising.org and www.youronlinechoices.com to identify the NAI members that have placed an advertising cookie file on your computer.
