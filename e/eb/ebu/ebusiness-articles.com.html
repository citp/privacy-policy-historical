<b>Cookies</b> <br>

<b>All visitors</b> - we place cookies on all Web site visitor hard drives to collect aggregate information on the number of visitors to our site and the number of pages viewed. <br>
<br>
<b>Registered visitors</b> - we place unique identifier cookies on the hard drives of those who sign on which are used to maintain the visitor "sign-on" status for the duration of the visit, for one-time customizing/tailoring of your visit and for long-term storage of user preferences. We also use cookies to track the pages visited by a visitor so that we can deliver content based on the visitor's profile (as provided by the visitor) and the visitor's past activity on our site. <br>
<br>
<b>General information</b> - cookie information is used only by eBusiness-Articles and our agents and is not provided to any other organization. It is used aggregately for traffic analysis and to provide relevant information to our visitors.
