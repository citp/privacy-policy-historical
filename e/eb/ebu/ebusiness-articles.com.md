**All visitors** \- we place cookies on all Web site visitor hard drives to collect aggregate information on the number of visitors to our site and the number of pages viewed. 

**Registered visitors** \- we place unique identifier cookies on the hard drives of those who sign on which are used to maintain the visitor "sign-on" status for the duration of the visit, for one-time customizing/tailoring of your visit and for long-term storage of user preferences. We also use cookies to track the pages visited by a visitor so that we can deliver content based on the visitor's profile (as provided by the visitor) and the visitor's past activity on our site. 

**General information** \- cookie information is used only by eBusiness-Articles and our agents and is not provided to any other organization.

**For Web site visitors who do not make purchases or otherwise identify themselves.**

If you do not sign on to our Web site, our Web server does not have access to personally identifiable information about you. It does not know your email address unless you volunteer it.
