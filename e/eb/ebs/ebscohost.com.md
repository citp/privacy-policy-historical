# Privacy Policy

EBSCO Information Services wants you to have a positive experience at the web sites operated by the EBSCO Information Services group and its two divisions, EBSCO Subscription Services and EBSCO Publishing. We want you to know that your privacy rights will be honored. EBSCO Information Services will never abuse your privacy rights. We discuss our information collection practices below. 

This Privacy Policy sets forth the privacy practices in effect at the EBSCO Information Services group websites. If you do not agree to these terms, do not access this web site. 

**What Information Is Collected and How is it Used?**

> **A. General Collection and Use of Personal Identifying Information**  
>  We will only collect and use personal identifying information (such as a first and last name, physical address including a street name, e-mail address, etc.) when a user voluntarily provides it to us. In order to use some portions of our web sites, or in order to undertake certain actions (such as setting up an account to make a purchase of an article), a user must first complete a registration form or provide an e-mail address that will require disclosure of personal identifying information. 
> 
> For example, the EBSCOhost service available at the EBSCO Publishing web site employs a Personalization feature that requires completion of a registration form before a user can use that feature. The Personalization feature of EBSCOhost is a powerful tool that provides users with the means to create and save histories of searches they have conducted. We believe the Personalization feature is a useful tool that will enhance the user's experience at the site, but it does require the user to provide personal identifying information to us. 
> 
> We will use the personal identifying information we collect for limited internal purposes that may include, but are not limited to, processing your transactions, establishing the identity of account holders, customer service, development, content processing, content classification, and providing you with information concerning our services. We will retain this information. We also may use that personal identifying information to improve and customize our content. In order to contact us by e-mail, you must provide an e-mail address.
> 
> We reserve the right to disclose your personal identifying information if we are required to do so by law, or in the good faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, to respond to claims, or to protect or advance the rights, property, safety, or well-being of our company, our employees, customers, or the public.
> 
>   
>  **B. Collection and Use of Information From Children**  
>  Some pages at our sites, particularly at the EBSCO Publishing site, are designed to be used by children. With respect to those pages, we comply with the provisions of the Children's On-Line Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). Accordingly, at those pages designed for use by children, we limit our collection of information to non-personal identifying information. At those pages, we do not collect personal identifying information (such as e-mail addresses, first and last name). We only use the non-personal identifying information we collect for internal uses, such as improving and customizing our content. We will not share or distribute this information to any third party.
> 
>   
>  **C. Collection of Non-Personal Identifying Information**  
>  We collect and use non-personal identifying information, including IP addresses and web server log files to track trends, administer the web site, track user movement, and gather demographic information. We use this non-personal identifying information in the aggregate. We do not combine these types of non-personal identifying information with personal identifying information. We may also share aggregated demographic information with our business partners, sponsors, advertisers, and companies that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with EBSCO Information Services. 
> 
> Cookies and Web Service Log File Data  
>  We may place a "cookie" or other tracking or information gathering device used in the industry in the browser files of a user's computer. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our web site. We are able to access only the cookies that our sites set on your computer and we are only able to determine the type of computer operating system and browser that you are using. We collect information from cookies and other information gathering devices and log files in the aggregate. We do not link the information collected through cookies or other devices to personal information that users submit online while participating in our activities. Users can set their browsers or third party software to reject cookies. If a user rejects the cookie, the user may be unable to use portions of our web site. Some of the web sites we provide links to also may use cookies. As noted in the "Links to Third Party Sites" section of the Legal/Trademark section of our site, we have no control over these linked web sites or access to or control over cookies or other technology used by linked web sites.
> 
> Information for Parents  
>  Most of the EBSCO Information Services sites are not directed toward children (as defined by COPPA) and these sites are not designed to collect personal identifying information from children. A few pages at our sites, particularly at the EBSCO Publishing site, contain publications that are designed to be used by children. At those pages, we do not collect personal identifying information. At the remaining EBSCO Information Services sites, children should not provide information on these sites, and should ask a parent help them. We urge parents to experience the World Wide Web with their children. If parents have any suggestions or comments please e-mail or write us. Go to Contact Us.
> 
> Security  
>  EBSCO Information Services has taken steps to ensure that personal identifying information collected in the future is secure, and we have limited the number of people who have access to the information, by electronic security systems and password protections that guard against unauthorized access. EBSCO Information Services provides links to web sites outside of EBSCO Information Services. These web sites may not have the same privacy policies as EBSCO Information Services. EBSCO Information Services takes reasonable care in recommending these web sites but is not responsible for their content or privacy policies. We urge users to read the privacy statement of an outside web site when leaving our site and linking to an outside web site.
