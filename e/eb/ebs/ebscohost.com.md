**2\. Non-Personal Information:   **any information that does not reveal your specific identity or does not directly relate to an identifiable individual. This might include web server log files, usage data, and device information. 

**B.    How Do We Collect the Information?**

We will only collect and use Personal Information when a user voluntarily provides it to us or when an institution or entity customer provides it to us in connection with its method of authenticating users for access to our Services, with the exception of your IP address which may be automatically captured when you use our Services. In order to use some of our Services, or in order to undertake certain actions (such as setting up an account to make a purchase of an article), a user must first complete a registration form or provide an email address that will require disclosure of Personal Information. Such disclosure is strictly voluntary. In order to contact us by email, however, you must provide an email address.

We automatically collect non-Personal Information, including usage data and web server log files, generated from your use of our Services.  We use this non-Personal Information in the aggregate. We do not combine these types of non-Personal Information with Personal Information.

**_Web Beacons_** :  EBSCO Information Services uses web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about users usage of our Services and interaction with emails from EBSCO Information Services. Web beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular website tied to the web beacon, and a description of a website tied to the web beacon.  As with cookies, you can use your browser or app settings to control web beacons.

**C.    How Do We Use the Information?**

We use the Personal Information we collect for limited purposes of processing your transactions, establishing the identity of account holders, customer service, authorization, customer support, content processing, content classification, and providing you with information concerning our Services. We will retain this information.

For example, our EBSCOhost Service employs a personalization feature that requires completion of a registration form before a user can use that feature. The personalization feature of EBSCOhost is a powerful tool that provides users with the means to create and save histories of searches they have conducted. We believe the personalization feature is a useful tool that will enhance the user's experience at the site, but it does require the user to provide Personal Information to us.

We use the non-Personal Information we collect to administer the Services, perform diagnostics, collect content-specific usage statistics, protect the Services and their content from inappropriate use, and improve the user's experience.

We may use the Personal Information and non-Personal Information we collect by sharing it with third party agents, vendors, contractors, partners, or content providers of EBSCO Information Services (collectively, "Contractors") for purposes of managing purchases of our products and services, servicing our systems, data storage contact management, and obtaining support services for our businesses. We are not in the business of selling Personal Information to third parties or Contractors, and will share it with Contractors only as we describe in this Privacy Policy. In situations where we provide Personal Information to Contractors, we ensure access is granted to the Contractors only upon the condition that the Personal Information is kept confidential and is used only for carrying out the services these Contractors are performing for EBSCO Information Services. As part of making that determination whether we will provide Personal Information to Contractors, we will obtain assurances that they will safeguard Personal Information consistently with this Privacy Policy.

We will not disclose any information about your usage data related to our Services to unaffiliated third parties, except as necessary to enhance the product experience, service the legal agreement between us and your employer or affiliated institution under which you are provided access to our Services, to enforce the terms of use, to meet our contractual obligations to report aggregated usage data to content providers, or as required by law.

We also reserve the right to disclose your Personal Information if we are required to do so by law, or in the good faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, to respond to claims, or to protect or advance the rights, property, safety, or well-being of our company, our employees, customers, or the public.

In the unlikely event that all or substantially all of the assets of EBSCO Publishing, Inc., DynaMed, LLC, EBSCO Industries, Inc. or Yankee Book Peddler, Inc. are acquired, customer information, which may include Personal Information, may be one of the transferred assets.

**D.    How Do We Secure Personal Information?**

EBSCO Information Services has taken steps to ensure that Personal Information collected in the future is secure, and we have limited the number of people who have access to the information, by electronic security systems and password protections that guard against unauthorized access. EBSCO Information Services provides links to third-party websites. These websites may not have the same privacy policies as EBSCO Information Services. We take reasonable care in recommending these websites but we are not responsible for their content or privacy policies. We urge users to read the privacy statement of a third-party website when leaving our Website and linking to a third-party website.

We always use industry-standard technologies when transferring and receiving consumer data we receive. We have appropriate security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you in connection with our Services.

**E.    How Can I Access, Correct, Amend or Remove Information About Me?**

We want to assure you that you have access to your Personal Information that we collect and store. Customers may correct or amend information, or delete information that is inaccurate, or prevent their information from being used for purposes other than those for which it was originally collected. To do so, please contact us by written request or email at the contact information stated above.

**F.   What Choices Do I Have?**

We understand that you may not want to allow our disclosure of your Personal Information to our Contractors, or to let us use that information for purposes that you believe may be incompatible with the purpose for which it originally was collected (as permitted by this Privacy Policy) or that you later may authorize. Therefore, you may contact us to inform us that you do not want to permit these uses of your personal identifying information. To do so, please contact us by mail or email at the address or email address provided above.

It is important to us that the Personal Information we collect is appropriate and relevant to the purposes for which we intend to use it. We will use Personal Information only in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by the person providing the information. EBSCO Information Services will take reasonable steps to ensure that personal information is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.

**G.     Collection and Use of Information from Children: Information for Parents**

Most of the Services are not directed toward children and are not designed to collect Personal Information from children. For our Services that are designed to be used by children, we comply with the provisions of the Children's On-Line Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").

#### **1.     Services for Children and Teens That Do Not Collect Personal Information**

Unless the Service’s Terms of Use states to the contrary, users of these Services may participate in many activities without providing any personally identifiable information.

We collect the following information on these Services:

  * If a user wants to use our personalization features, we ask the user to register with their first name only. [This is not considered personal information by the FTC.]
  * If a user makes a specific request for a one-time e-mail, we request the user's email address to respond once, but the email address is deleted immediately after responding.
  * Where we do collect a user's email address to respond more than once to a specific request (alerts), we do not allow children under 13 to participate.



We only use the non-Personal Information we collect for internal uses, such as improving and customizing our content. We do not link the information collected through cookies or other devices to personal information that users submit online while participating in our activities.

We will not share or distribute this information to any outside third parties not bound by this Privacy Policy.  
 

#### **2.     Services for Children and Teens That Collect Personal Information**

Some Services have a target audience of school age children, their parents, teachers, and school administrators. Those Services are governed by special information collection policies. Those policies are viewable by users by clicking on a special privacy policy link that is at the gateway to the websites for those Services. At those sites, it is EBSCO Information Services' policy to require only the minimal collection of information from the user that is reasonably necessary for the user to use the Service.  We do not condition children's participation upon disclosure of any more Personal Information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. However, for some Services, it is necessary for EBSCO Information Services to collect Personal Information. The collection and use of that information is explained in the privacy policy that is specific to the Service that collects personal information.

If you are a parent and would like to review any personally identifiable information that we have collected online from your child, have this information deleted, request that there be no further collection or use of your child's information, or if you have questions about these information practices, you may contact us at the address or email address listed above.

#### **3.     General Information**

For Services other than those in item 2 above, children should not provide information, and should ask a parent to help them. We urge parents to experience the World Wide Web with their children. 

**EU- U.S. Privacy Shield**
