    EBSCO Information Services wants you to have a positive experience at the Web sites 
    operated by the EBSCO Information Services group and its two divisions, EBSCO 
    Subscription Services and EBSCO Publishing. We want you to know that we respect the 
    privacy and security of our users. Our goal is to provide you with an experience that 
    delivers the information, resources and services that are helpful to you. In order to 
    achieve this goal, we may collect information from you. We discuss our information 
    collection practices below. 
    <br><br>
    This Privacy Policy sets forth the privacy practices in effect at the EBSCO Information 
    Services group Web sites. If you do not agree to these terms, do not access this Web site. 
    <br><br>
    <strong>Information about Children's Areas is in Section E of this Policy</strong>
    <br><br>
    <strong>What Information is Collected and How is it Used?</strong>
    <br><br>
    <strong>A.	General Collection and Use of Personal, Identifying Information</strong><br>
    We will only collect and use personal, identifying information (such as a first 
    and last name, physical address including a street name, e-mail address, 
    telephone number, etc.) when a user voluntarily provides it to us. In order to 
    use some portions of our Web sites, or in order to undertake certain actions 
    (such as setting up an account to make a purchase of an article), a user must 
    first complete a registration form or provide an e-mail address that will require 
    disclosure of personal, identifying information. Such disclosure is strictly 
    voluntary. In order to contact us by e-mail, however, you must provide an e-mail 
    address.
    <br><br>
    For example, the EBSCO<em>host</em><font size="-1"><sup>®</sup></font> service 
    employs a Personalization feature that requires completion of a registration 
    form before a user can use that feature. 
    <br><br>
    We will use the personal, identifying information we collect for limited internal 
    purposes that may include, but are not limited to, processing your transactions, 
    establishing the identity of account holders, customer service, development, 
    content processing, content classification and providing you with information 
    concerning our services. We will retain this information. We also may use that 
    personal, identifying information to improve and customize our content. 
    <br><br>
    We reserve the right to disclose your personal, identifying information if we 
    are required to do so by law, or in the good faith belief that disclosure of 
    the information is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, to respond 
    to claims, or to protect or advance the rights, property, safety or well-being 
    of our company, our employees, customers or the public.
    <br><br>
    <strong>B.	Collection of Non-Personal, Identifying Information</strong><br>
    We collect and use non-personal, identifying information, including IP addresses 
    and Web-server log files to track trends, administer the Web site, track user 
    movement and gather demographic information. We use this non-personal, identifying 
    information in the aggregate. We do not combine these types of non-personal, 
    identifying information with personal, identifying information. We may also share 
    aggregated demographic information with our business partners, sponsors, 
    advertisers and companies that control, are controlled by, or are under common 
    control with EBSCO Information Services. 
    <br><br>
    <strong>C.	Cookies and Web Service Log File Data</strong><br>
    We may place a "cookie" or other tracking or information gathering device used 
    in the industry in the browser files of a user's computer. A cookie is a piece 
    of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. 
    Cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance 
    the experience on our Web site. We are able to access only the cookies that our 
    sites set on your computer, and we are able only to determine the type of 
    computer operating system and browser that you are using. We collect information 
    from cookies and other information gathering devices and log files in the 
    aggregate. We do not link the information collected through cookies or other 
    devices to personal information that users submit online while participating 
    in our activities. Users can set their browsers or third party software to 
    reject cookies. If a user rejects the cookie, the user may be unable to use 
    portions of our Web site. Some of the Web sites we provide links to also may 
    use cookies. 
    <br><br>
    <strong>D.	Security</strong><br>
    EBSCO Information Services has taken steps to ensure that personal, identifying 
    information collected is secure, and we have limited the number of people who 
    have access to the information by electronic security systems and password 
    protections that guard against unauthorized access. EBSCO Information Services 
    provides links to Web sites outside of EBSCO Information Services. These Web 
    sites may not have the same privacy policies as EBSCO Information Services. EBSCO 
    Information Services takes reasonable care in recommending these Web sites, but 
    is not responsible for their content, privacy policies or security. We urge 
    users to read the privacy statement of an outside Web site when leaving our site 
    and linking to an outside Web site. 
    <br><br>
    We always use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and 
    receiving consumer data exchanged with our site. We have appropriate security 
    measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse 
    or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our site.
    <br><br>
    <strong>E.	Collection and Use of Information from Children: Information for Parents</strong><br>
    Most of the EBSCO Information Services sites are not directed toward children. 
    These sites are not designed to collect personal, identifying information from 
    children. On our sites that are designed to be used by children, we comply with 
    the provisions of the Children's On-Line Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"):
    <br><br>
    EBSCO Web sites for Children and Teens:<br>
    Users of these services may participate in many activities without providing 
    any personal, identifying information. We do not condition children's participation 
    upon disclosure of any more personal information than is reasonably necessary 
    to participate in the activity.
    <br><br>
    We collect the following information:
    <ul>
    <li>If a user wants to use our Personalization features, we ask the user to 
    register with their first name only. [This is not considered personal 
    information by the FTC.]
    </li><li>If a user makes a specific request for a one-time e-mail, we request the 
    user's e-mail address to respond once, but the e-mail address is deleted 
    immediately after responding. [Section 312.5(c)(2)]
    </li><li>Where we do collect a user's e-mail address to respond more than once to 
    a specific request (alerts), we do not allow children under 13 to participate.
    </li></ul>
    
    We only use the non-personal, identifying information we collect for internal 
    uses, such as improving and customizing our content. We do not link the 
    information collected through cookies or other devices to personal information 
    that users submit online while participating in our activities. 
    <br><br>
    We will not share or distribute this information to any outside third parties 
    not bound by this Privacy Policy. 
    <br><br>
    At the remaining EBSCO Information Services sites, children should not provide 
    information on these sites and should ask a parent help them. We urge parents 
    to experience the Web with their children. 
    <br><br>
    If you are a parent and would like to:
    <ul>
    <li>review any personal, identifying information that we have collected online 
    from your child,
    </li><li>have this information deleted, and/or 
    </li><li>request that there be no further collection or use of your child's information 
    </li><li>or if you have questions about these information practices, 
    </li></ul>
    
    you may contact us at the address or telephone numbers listed above.
    <br><br>
    <strong>F.	How to Correct Information.</strong><br>
    Customers may correct information or prevent their information from being used 
    for purposes other than those for which it was originally collected by contacting 
    us by written request, phone or e-mail at the contact information stated above.
    <br><br>
    <strong>G.	Questions.</strong><br>
    If you have any questions, comments or concerns regarding the EBSCO Information 
    Services privacy policy or practices, please go to our Feedback/Comments page 
    and send us an e-mail or write to us at the addresses found at that page or 
    listed above.
    <br><br>
    <strong>H.	Changes to Privacy Policy.</strong><br>
    We will notify you of changes to the EBSCO Information Services Web site Privacy Policy by 
    posting an updated policy on this page with a notification link to this page from 
    the homepage or by a "News Box." You agree that continued use of the Web site is 
    an acknowledgment and consent to any terms contained in the EBSCO Information 
    Services Web site Privacy Policy, current at the time of use.
    <br><br>
