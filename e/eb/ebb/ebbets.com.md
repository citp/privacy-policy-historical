We may create reports based on that information to share with our clients, but these reports never contain any personally identifiable information.

We might share that conclusion with our clients to improve the effectiveness of their email campaigns.

Ebbets employs permission-based marketing principles: it requires its clients to communicate only to users who affirmatively express an interest in receiving e-mails relevant to their interests in a particular company or product. Permission to receive e-mails may be granted and taken away; in other words customers may "opt-in" and "opt-out".

The Ebbets does not sell, rent, loan, trade, or lease any personal information whether gathered by Ebbets itself or received from its clients.
