## Personal Information We Collect

We collect Personal Information in two ways:

  1. **When you give it to us or give us permission to obtain it:**  When you sign up on the Site, you will be prompted to provide identifying information such as name, address, telephone number, email address and eBay user ID. You may also give us information (such as testimonials, experience reports and editorials) when you participate in a campaign or in a Main Street Member Program Event (“Event”). If you communicate with us through email or otherwise we may save a copy of the correspondences sent to us or by us. Finally, if you use the like or share buttons in our Site to let your friends know about your interest we will record it.

  2. **We also get technical information when you use our site:**  Whenever you use an internet service nowadays there is certain information that almost always gets created and recorded automatically. This is true for our Site also. Some examples are:


  * Log Data: This is information that is automatically recorded by us or our service providers when you visit us such as your Internet Protocol address, the address of the web page you were browsing before visiting us, browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, and how you browsed our Site. We or our service providers may use “cookies” or similar technologies to record log data. To learn more about cookies read our [Cookie Notice](https://www.ebaymainstreet.com/privacy-and-cookie-notice#Cookie%20Notice) below.
  * Device Information: Your access device makes certain information available to us or our service providers such as what type of device it is, your operating system, and Device ID or unique device identifier. To learn more about the information that your device makes available check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.



## What about Cookies? (Cookie Notice)

We or our authorized service providers may install cookies in your device when you visit us. We may also use other similar technologies. Cookies are tiny text files that are placed in the memory of your browser or device and allow us to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with our Site. Cookies may be “session” cookies (that last until you close your browser) or “persistent” cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them).

We use cookies and similar technologies only to assess the performance of our Site, including as part of our analytic practices to help us understand how our visitors use our Site, determine if an Event or link has been viewed, or to improve our Site content. For example, we use third party Analytics ([Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/)) to obtain web traffic information that allows us to optimize our Site. To learn how to opt-out read the Your Choices section below. We do not use cookies or similar technologies to serve targeted advertising.

If you reside within the United States: California law requires us to say how we respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. Because we do not collect Personal Information about our users over time and across third party websites and online services, we do not currently respond to DNT signals.

## How We Use Your Personal Information

We use the information we collect to provide our services to you and to make them better. For example, we may use and retain your information to provide access to and use of our Site, measure and improve our services, provide other services requested by you as described when we collect the information, telephone or text messages on eBay’s latest government efforts that may impact your eBay experience, to provide you with legislative alerts, let you know about Events, and inform you about how to contact government officials if you have consented to such contact.

We retain your Personal Information as long as it is necessary and relevant for our operations. In addition, we may retain Personal information to comply with national laws, assist with any investigation, enforce our Terms of Use and take other actions permitted or required by applicable national laws. After it is no longer necessary for us to retain your Personal Information, we dispose of it in a secure manner according to our data retention and deletion policies.

## How We Share Your Personal Information

We do not share your Personal Information with third parties for their marketing purposes. We do share it in limited instances that include:

  * Sharing upon your request. For example, when you participate in a petition we will share your information to let your political representatives know that you support the petition.
  * Sharing with third party service providers we employ to process Personal Information on our behalf based on our instructions and in compliance with this Policy. For example, we may share information with a third party we hire to handle emails.
  * Sharing with [members of the eBay Inc. corporate family](http://www.ebayprivacycenter.com/about-us/corporate-family) to provide joint services. For example, if you choose to participate in a tickets-related campaign, we may share your information with StubHub. 
  * Sharing when we believe it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law; regulation, or legal request; to protect the safety, rights, or property of the public, any person, or eBay; or to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.



Finally, we may engage in certain transactions that require us to transfer Personal Information, such as mergers, acquisitions, or dissolution, in accordance with our global privacy standards. 

## Your Choices

  * You may request access to the Personal Information provided to us during registration or request that such information be updated by writing us an email at [government_relations@ebay.com](mailto:government_relations@ebay.com) or by contacting us through our [Contact Us ](https://www.ebaymainstreet.com/contact) page at any time.

  * You may opt-out of Google Analytics by installing [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on ](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) 
  * Your browser or device may allow you to set your preferences in a way that blocks our cookies.



## How We Protect Your Personal Information

We work very hard to protect your information by using technical and administrative security measures (such as encryption, passwords, physical access controls, information access authorisation controls, etc.) to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure and alteration.

## Other Important Information

  * We may change this notice from time to time. If we do, we will post any changes on this Site.

If you continue to use our Site after those changes are in effect, you agree to the revised notice.

  * When you share information with third party social media websites (e.g. by using the like button to share information about a campaign you have joined) remember that the information these third parties collect is subject to their privacy policies, not ours.
  * Your Personal Information may be processed and retained on servers in the United States and elsewhere in the world where our data centers are located. The laws pertaining to Personal Information in the United States may be different than the laws of the country where you reside.
