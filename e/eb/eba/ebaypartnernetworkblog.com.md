 **9.     DATA OWNERSHIP: **

eBay retains all ownership rights in eBay Data. eBay does not in any way assign, transfer, or convey title of eBay Data to Service Provider.

 **10\. Survival:   **

Your obligations and eBay’s rights under this DPRA shall become effective on the Effective Date of the Terms and will continue in effect so long as you possess eBay Data.

**12.   Processing of Personal Data:   **

The following additional terms shall apply to the Processing of Personal Data by you:

For the avoidance of doubt, eBay’s written instructions for the Processing of Personal Data shall comply with Applicable Law. In the event you reasonably believe there is a conflict amongst Applicable Law or that eBay’s instructions conflict with any Applicable Law, you will inform eBay immediately and shall cooperate in good faith to resolve the conflict and achieve the goals of such instruction. 

b.     Use of Sub-Processors: 

  i. Contractual Privity. Your obligations under this DPRA shall apply to Sub-Processors.

Proof of these contractual obligations, in which commercially sensitive terms may be redacted, shall be provided to eBay promptly upon request. In the event that eBay reasonably believes a Sub-Processor Processes eBay Personal Data without having entered into a contractual agreement with you containing data protection obligations required by the Terms, eBay’s Processing instructions or by Applicable Law, eBay will promptly inform you and you shall cooperate in good faith to resolve the conflict and achieve the goals of such instruction. 

  ii. List Maintenance. You shall maintain a list of all Sub-Processors you have engaged to Process eBay Personal Data. Where required by law, you shall (i) inform eBay of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of Sub-Processors with access to eBay Personal Data and give eBay the opportunity to object to such changes, and (ii) obtain the prior written consent of eBay before entering into any such agreement (unless expressly waived in a written agreement). 

  iii. Organizational, Technical, and Physical Safeguards.

Additionally, you will prohibit through organizational, technical and physical safeguards the Sub-Processor from Processing eBay Personal Data for any other purpose. Sub-Processors must similarly implement appropriate organizational, technical and physical measures to ensure that the Processing of eBay Data occurs in strict accordance with the Terms, eBay’s Processing instructions and Applicable Law and Regulations. 

  iv. Sub-Processor Liability. You shall remain liable for any act or omission of a Sub-Processor that does not comply with the Terms, any Processing instructions or the requirements of Applicable Law. 

14.3        Transfer of Personal Data: You shall not cause or permit any Personal Data to be transferred across borders in breach of Applicable Law. Cross-border transfers of Personal Data subject to legal restrictions by Applicable Law shall require eBay’s prior written consent. For the avoidance of doubt, this transfer restriction does not pertain to eBay personnel access to Personal Data. 

14.4        Limitation on Disclosure of Personal Data: To the extent legally permitted, you shall immediately notify eBay in writing upon receipt of an order, demand, or document purporting to request, demand or compel the production of Personal Data to any third party. You shall not disclose Personal Data to the third party without providing eBay at least forty-eight (48) hours’ notice, so that eBay may, at its own expense, exercise such rights as it may have under Applicable Law to prevent or limit such disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you will exercise commercially reasonable efforts to prevent and limit any such disclosure and to otherwise preserve the confidentiality of Personal Data; additionally, you will cooperate with eBay with respect to any action taken pursuant to such order, demand, or other document request, including to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to Personal Data. 

14.5        Compliance with Applicable Law: You shall Process Personal Data in accordance with Applicable Law. You represent and warrant that you will maintain privacy policies sufficient to protect the Personal Data and compliant with the Applicable Law.

14\. 7   Personal Data transmitted to eBay: Prior to sharing any Personal Data with eBay, you shall ensure that Data Subjects are appropriately notified of and have consented to eBay’s privacy practices. You warrant that you have a legitimate basis and adequate title to collect and share Personal Data with eBay.

### Other important privacy information

This section describes some additional privacy information related to your use of our Services that you may find important.

 **When you share your personal information on our sites or applications – what happens?**

Other users have access to the information you share on eBay. For example, other users can see your bids, purchases, items for sale, your collections, the sellers and collections you follow, storefronts, feedback, ratings, product reviews and associated comments. Other users can also see any information you chose to share in your profile or your collections.

When you use our Services, your public user ID may be displayed and available to the public and associated with all of your public eBay activity. Notices sent to other users about suspicious activity and notice violations on our sites may refer to your public user ID and specific items. If you associate your name with your user ID, the people to whom you have revealed your name may then be able to identify your eBay activities.

To help protect your privacy, we allow only limited access to other users' contact, shipping and financial information as necessary to facilitate your transactions and collect payments. However, when users are involved in a transaction, they have access to each other's name, user ID, email address and other contact and shipping information.

 **Your responsibilities over transactional information you receive through eBay**

When you transact with another user, we enable you to obtain or we may provide you with the personal information of the other user (such as their name, account ID, email address, contact details, shipping and billing address) to complete the transaction. Independent from us, you are the controller of such data and we encourage you to inform the other user about your privacy practices and respect their privacy. In all cases, you must comply with the applicable privacy laws, and must give the other user a chance to remove them from your database and them a chance to review what information you have collected about them.

You may use the personal information that you have access to only for eBay transaction-related purposes, or for other services offered through eBay (such as escrow, shipping, fraud complaints, and member-to-member communications), and for purposes expressly consented by the user to whom the information relates. Using personal information of other users that you have access to for any other purpose constitutes a violation of our [User Agreement](http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/user-agreement.html?rt=nc).

 **Unwanted or threatening email**

We do not tolerate abuse of our Services. You do not have permission to add other users to your mailing list (email or postal), call, or send him/her text messages for commercial purposes, even if this user purchased something from you, unless the user has given his/her explicit consent. Sending unwanted or threatening email and text messages is against our [User Agreement](http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/user-agreement.html?rt=nc). To report eBay-related spam or spoof emails please forward the email to [spam@ebay.com](mailto:spam@ebay.com) or [spoof@ebay.com](mailto:spoof@ebay.com).

 **Communication tools**

We may scan messages automatically and check for spam, viruses, phishing and other malicious activity, illegal or prohibited content or violations of our User Agreement, this privacy notice or our other policies.

 **Children's Privacy**

Our websites are general audience websites and not intended for children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from users deemed to be children under their respective national laws.

 **Third Party Privacy Practices**

This privacy notice addresses only our use and handling of personal information we collect from you in connection with providing you our Services. If you disclose your information to a third party, or visit a third party website via a link from our Services, their privacy notices and practices will apply to any personal information you provide to them or they collect from you.

We cannot guarantee the privacy or security of your personal information once you provide it to a third party and we encourage you to evaluate the privacy and security policies of your trading partner before entering into a transaction and choosing to share your personal information. This is true even where the third parties to whom you disclose personal information are bidders, buyers or sellers on our site.
