  5. **Compensation.**  

    1.  **Qualifying Transactions**. 
      1. Subject to other provisions in this Agreement you will be compensated for each Qualifying Transaction in accordance with the applicable Program Details. There may be exceptions to the rate card shown in the applicable Program Details for certain Affiliates or certain circumstances. Compensation will be calculated based on EPN’s tracking data at the end of each month, which is definitive and shall control in the event of any tracking dispute.
      2. If an end user has clicked on multiple Links from different Affiliates prior to a Qualifying Transaction (resulting in multiple cookies placed on the end user’s computer), EPN shall only compensate the Affiliate whose Link was the last clicked by the end user so long as the applicable Advertiser did not conduct any promotional activities (a) subsequent to such click and prior to the Qualifying Transaction and (b) that would have placed a cookie overwriting the cookie from the last Affiliate’s Link.
      3. EPN has the right to change any existing Program Details with respect to Qualifying Transactions and compensation in its sole discretion with three (3) days’ notice to you.
    2. **Payments.**
      1. **Timing.** Subject to Section II.B (Accurate Information), each month, EPN will issue to you any positive balance in your account for transactions reported for the previous month, so long as your account balance exceeds the required minimum account balance of 10 USD, 10 CAD, 10 EUR or 10 GBP, as applicable. The number or amount of transactions, credits for payments and debits for chargebacks as calculated by EPN shall be final and binding on you.
      2. **Form of Payment.** The currency of your account is determined by your country of residence. You can collect payments (a) with a verified PayPal account or (b) by direct deposit if available for your country of residence. The conversion rate will be determined in accordance with EPN’s operating standards using the rates prevailing on the date the Qualifying Transaction is completed.
    3. **Taxes.** You are responsible for any taxes that may be due in connection with your participation in the Network or otherwise on the services provided by you. EPN does not pay additional compensation to you for taxes. If the withholding of any tax is required in respect of any payment to you, EPN will (1) withhold the applicable amount from such payment and (2) pay such amount to the relevant authorities in accordance with any Applicable Law in the relevant jurisdiction(s). Upon request from you, EPN will provide a copy of the tax receipt documenting payment of the tax to the relevant authorities. You agree to complete and provide to us or to the applicable taxing authority at least 10 days prior to the payment due date, such forms, certifications or other documents as may be reasonably requested by EPN, to reduce or exempt withholding taxes with respect to payments made to you when and where required by Applicable Law. If it is later determined that EPN should have withheld and/or paid additional tax but did not withhold or pay such tax, then you shall pay the applicable tax and hold EPN harmless from any penalties or interest thereon.
    4. **Non-Payment, Withholding, Reversal and Chargebacks**
      1. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, EPN shall have no duty to pay you for Qualifying Transactions during any current or previous month when you were in breach of this Agreement or an agreement covering your participation in eBay’s Buy API Program (if applicable), or if EPN, in its sole discretion, has reason to believe that you or your Agent(s) have breached this Agreement or have engaged in potentially fraudulent activities.
      2. EPN may debit your account in an amount equal to a payment previously made to you or a compensation that has been credited to your account, but has not been paid yet, if EPN determines in its sole discretion that there has been (a) duplicate entry or other clear error; (b) non-bona fide transactions or other fraudulent activity; (c) a breach of, or other failure to complete or reversal of the Qualifying Transaction; or (d) failure to comply with any terms of this Agreement. EPN may apply a chargeback to your account at any time, including previous payment cycles.
      3. EPN will make all commercially reasonable efforts to pay any positive balance that is due to you. In certain circumstances, based on EPN’s records, it may not be possible for EPN to pay you because for a period of 24 months or more: (a) your account has been inactive, meaning that you have not logged into your account or you have not accepted funds, payments or other amounts that EPN has attempted to pay or deliver to you; (b) EPN has been unable to reach you, or has not received adequate payment instructions from you, after contacting you at the email address shown in EPN’s records; or (c) you have not generated the minimum amount of commissions to qualify for payment. In these circumstances, EPN may, without further notice to you, turn the unpaid or undelivered amounts over to the applicable regulatory authorities in accordance with Applicable Law.
    5. Tracking and True-Up Payments 
      1. Although EPN strives to track all Qualifying Transactions accurately, there may be instances where EPN fails to track all Qualifying Transactions. 
      2. In cases where EPN discovers that EPN has failed to capture all Qualifying Transactions, EPN shall strive to determine the discrepancies between intended and actual Qualifying Transactions and conduct true-up payments. If EPN deems appropriate, EPN may design a methodology for calculating true-up payments in EPN’s sole discretion. 
  6. **Privacy.**  

    1.  **User Information Received from EPN**. In connection with your participation in the Network and the Programs, EPN may make available certain information that relates to an EPN or eBay user, browser or device (“EPN User Data”). EPN User Data is EPN’s Confidential Information. You may not use EPN User Data other than for the purpose for which it was provided to you, and under no circumstances to create or augment audience profiles.
    2. **EPN Access to Affiliate End User Data**. EPN may request access to information regarding your end users when necessary to enforce EPN’s rights under this Agreement or to verify your compliance with your obligations under this Agreement.

        2. your use of third-party technology, including EPN’s tracking technology,
        3. your use of cookies and options for discontinuing use of such cookies. 
      2.

    2. **Right to Audit.** EPN and its service providers have the right to audit your or your Agent’s sites or activities in relation to your and your Agent’s participation in the Network and the Programs. You shall not block or otherwise interfere with such audit, and EPN and its service providers may use technical means to overcome any methods you may use to block or interfere with such audit. To the extent not prohibited by Applicable Law, audits may include requests for documents and server logs, and visits to your facilities and those of your Agents. Your failure to reasonably comply with EPN’s efforts to audit your or your Agents’ compliance with this Agreement shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement. If Applicable Law does not allow you to share server logs with EPN, you must provide EPN with other proper proof of traffic that you sent to Participating Sites and Content.
    3. **Remedy for Breach.** If EPN in its sole discretion believes that you or your Agents have breached this Agreement or that you or your Agents have engaged in fraudulent activity, it may take any and all steps it deems appropriate including without limitation:

      2. Conduct an investigation;
      3. Suspend your account from participating in a specific Program or from the Network as a whole;
      4. Terminate your account from a specific Program or from the Network as a whole; or
      5. Withhold or recover any compensation.  
In addition to any other available remedies, EPN may seek specific performance, injunctive relief and/or attorneys’ fees in its sole discretion.
    4. **Suspension.** – If EPN suspends your account from the Network or a Program, you will no longer get paid for any future activity.

      1. If you buy paid traffic, linking from paid placements or paid search placements to a non-Advertiser domain is allowed as long as you do not immediately or automatically redirect end users to Advertiser sites and services. Also, if you buy traffic to your sites through sponsored links, you must ensure that all campaigns add [these domains](https://partnernetwork.ebay.com/excluded-sites) to their list of excluded sites, and add “eBay” as a negative keyword. 
      2. Linking from social media advertising methods (e.g. Facebook boosted Posts) directly to the Advertiser’s domain is permitted. 


  2. _Restricted Promotional Methods._ You may not engage in the following Promotional Methods without the prior written approval of EPN. The application to get an approval can be made from [here.](https://partnernetwork.ebay.com/sbm)
    1. **Incentive Programs.** Your Promotional Methods may not directly or indirectly offer any reward or incentive for any Qualifying Transaction without EPN’s prior written approval. Any subsequent change to an approved incentive program also requires EPN’s prior written approval. 
    2. **Electronic Communications.** You may not promote Participating Sites and Content using email or other forms of electronic communication (for example, SMS, instant messaging, or IRC) without EPN’s prior written approval. If you are permitted to use such electronic communications: 
      1. They must comply with the requirements of Applicable Law, such as the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 as in effect at any given time. 
      2. EPN’s or Advertiser’s name may not appear in the “from” line of the message. 
    3. **Paid Traffic Sources**. Without EPN’s prior approval, you may not direct traffic from Promotional Content or Links served by ad networks or their agents directly to Advertiser sites and services. 
    4. **Software Applications.** You will not promote Participating Sites and Content using Software Applications without EPN’s prior written approval. Such Software Applications must comply with the additional terms in this Section. EPN reserves the right to immediately terminate any Software Applications at any time, with or without notice or cause. 
      1. **Installation Requirements.**
        1. Your Software Application may be provided only to end users who affirmatively consent to install it. Your Software Application may not trick end users into installing it. 
          1. Before your Software Application is installed, you must clearly and conspicuously disclose the principal and significant functions. 
          2. If your Software Application collects or transmits personal information about end users, you must clearly and conspicuously disclose this information in general terms and offer a full privacy policy. After you have made these disclosures, you must request an end user’s consent to proceed with installation. 
        2. EPN prohibits Software Applications installed in any type of bundle with other software of any kind without EPN’s prior written approval. EPN shall determine in its sole discretion what functions constitute bundling, which may include installation bundling. For example, a function in a web browser software that affixes your company’s site as the browser’s start page would constitute a bundling arrangement between your company and the browser software. 
        3. Your Software Application must be easy for end users to remove, using standard practices appropriate for the supported operating system(s) or other platform(s). 
      2. **Operation Requirements.** Your Software Application may send a user to a Participating Sites and Content via a Tracking Code only in an immediate response to a user’s deliberate and voluntary click (or, for a touch-capable device, tap) on a clearly-labeled Link. Except for any perpetual search box, toolbar button, or similar mechanism that is on screen at all times, your Software Application may not present ads for any other sites, services, Advertisers, or offers when a user visits Participating Sites and Content or when Participating Sites and Content is open on a user’s computer or mobile device. Your Software Application is prohibited if in EPN’s sole discretion it is likely to confuse the end user or trick the end user into thinking the Software Application is part of the Participating Sites and Content. Regardless, if your Software Application presents an ad for Advertiser when the end user is already on Participating Sites and Content, the Software Application must not send the end user to Participating Sites and Content via a Tracking Code on user’s computer or mobile device and you shall not earn compensation for any transaction resulting from such activity. 
      3. **Advance Review and Approval by EPN.** Before distributing any Software Application or participating in any Program, you must provide EPN with a complete statement of the characteristics of your Software Application. Before EPN provides its approval, you must integrate your Software Application with EPN so EPN may evaluate the integration and its effect on Advertisers’ brand and Advertisers’ customer experience. EPN will withhold all compensation for traffic directed through Software Applications not approved by EPN. If a new version of your Software Application makes material changes to your participation in the Network, you must provide EPN with a complete statement of such changes for written approval. For purposes of this Section, “material changes” include any change to the methods of installation of your Software Application, the partners who distribute your Software Application, or the circumstances in which your Software Application sends end users to Participating Sites and Content. 
      4. **Software Application Prohibited Behaviors.**
        1. You may not promote the Network through any Software Application that provides, or purports to provide, sniping functionality; that automatically places bids on behalf of end users; or that automatically makes purchases on behalf of end users. 
        2. You may not operate or distribute Software Applications or participate in any Programs through any Agents or other intermediaries. 
        3. Subject to EPN’s prior written approval, you may not use pop-ups, pop-unders, sliders, or sidebars to promote any Participating Sites and Content, nor may you modify the presentation or appearance of another web site as seen in a user’s web browser. EPN may approve such practices if all such modifications are consistent with the user experience disclosed at the time of installation, if all modifications include clear and conspicuous labels disclosing the modification and provide a mechanism for end users to obtain details, if modifications are not likely to confuse end users, and if your offering in EPN’s sole discretion genuinely delivers real and significant value to end users. 
        4. Your Software Application may not attempt to evade testing, and may not attempt to conceal its practices. The practices of your Software Application should be consistent when run in a virtual environment, from varying IP addresses, and at varying times of day and days of the week. 
        5. Worms, viruses, and trojan horses are strictly prohibited. 
      5. **Using Software Applications Provided by Others.** If you contract, directly or indirectly, to use a Software Application provided by another person or entity, you are responsible for complying with the requirements of this Section exactly as if the Software Application were your own. 
    5. **Additional Restricted Promotional Methods**. Any Promotional Method that is not expressly permitted or prohibited under this Code of Conduct is a Restricted Promotional Method and cannot be used without EPN’s prior written approval. Examples of these include: 
      1. distribution of Promotional Content via Agents, distribution partners, or via ad networks; 
      2. promotional Content created by a developer’s program tool or API; or holding in-person trainings and classes. 


  3. _Prohibited Promotional Methods._ You may not engage in the following Promotional Methods 
    1. **Cookie Stuffing.** You may not stuff cookies or other tracking tags on an end user’s computer without any affirmative action by the end user. End users that are only viewing your website, Promotional Content or advertisements or while your applications are merely active or open have not taken any affirmative actions. 
    2. **Non-Bona Fide Qualifying Transactions.** You may not cause Qualifying Transactions to be made in bad faith, including but not limited to using invisible methods to generate impressions, clicks or transactions that are not initiated by the affirmative and genuine action of an end user, or using any cookie, device, program, robot, iframe or hidden frame, pop-up window or any other operation or process that interferes with EPN’s ability to properly identify and track transactions. Any method that artificially generates clicks, impressions, or activity is prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to, clicks or impressions generated when you or your Agents click on your own Promotional Content containing Tracking Code, automated clicking tools or traffic sources, robots, or other deceptive software. To be considered valid, clicks and conversions must result from genuine user interest. EPN will use its sole discretion to determine instances of invalid click activity, which may come in different forms and may include activity not due to any deliberate action on your part. EPN is not obliged to disclose details about the functioning of EPN’s fraud detection systems. Because EPN needs to protect its proprietary detection system, EPN may be unable to provide you with all information about your account activity, including any web pages, end users, or third-party services that may have been involved in fraudulent activities. 
    3. **Improper Influence.** You may not make your own advertising claims. You may not interfere with or seek to improperly influence the referral of an end user to Participating Sites and Content. You may not mislead or trick an end user in any way into clicking on a Link. It must be clear for end users where they are being directed at all times. 
    4. **Middle Servers and URL Cloaking Services.** You may not redirect any traffic to middle servers for the purpose of masking your referring source of traffic. This includes any URL shortening services other than the ones noted in Section I.F.

    7. **Misdirection, Redirection and Framing.**
      1. You may not make any express or implied representations, or otherwise create an appearance that a visitor to your website and/or Promotional Content is visiting Participating Sites and Content, for example, by framing or wrapping a site in any manner. You may not design your Promotional Methods in a way that, in EPN’s sole discretion, creates a likelihood of confusion with the website or emails belonging to the Advertiser.

This includes such things as maintaining and improving the performance of our products, keeping our systems secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records. This is the general rule that establishes the baseline for most of our data retention periods.

Examples can include mandatory data retention laws in the applicable jurisdiction, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation, or personal information retained for the purposes of litigation.

### Other important privacy information

This section describes some additional privacy information related to your use of our Services that you may find important.

 **When you share your personal information on our sites or applications – what happens?**

Other users have access to the information you share on eBay. For example, other users can see your bids, purchases, items for sale, your collections, the sellers and collections you follow, storefronts, feedback, ratings, product reviews and associated comments. Other users can also see any information you chose to share in your profile or your collections.

When you use our Services, your public user ID may be displayed and available to the public and associated with all of your public eBay activity. Notices sent to other users about suspicious activity and notice violations on our sites may refer to your public user ID and specific items. If you associate your name with your user ID, the people to whom you have revealed your name may then be able to identify your eBay activities.

To help protect your privacy, we allow only limited access to other users' contact, shipping and financial information as necessary to facilitate your transactions and collect payments. However, when users are involved in a transaction, they have access to each other's name, user ID, email address and other contact and shipping information.

 **Your responsibilities over transactional information you receive through eBay**

When you transact with another user, we enable you to obtain or we may provide you with the personal information of the other user (such as their name, account ID, email address, contact details, shipping and billing address) to complete the transaction. Independent from us, you are the controller of such data and we encourage you to inform the other user about your privacy practices and respect their privacy. In all cases, you must comply with the applicable privacy laws, and must give the other user a chance to remove them from your database and them a chance to review what information you have collected about them.

You may use the personal information that you have access to only for eBay transaction-related purposes, or for other services offered through eBay (such as escrow, shipping, fraud complaints, and member-to-member communications), and for purposes expressly consented by the user to whom the information relates. Using personal information of other users that you have access to for any other purpose constitutes a violation of our [User Agreement](http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/user-agreement.html?rt=nc).

 **Unwanted or threatening email**

We do not tolerate abuse of our Services. You do not have permission to add other users to your mailing list (email or postal), call, or send him/her text messages for commercial purposes, even if this user purchased something from you, unless the user has given his/her explicit consent. Sending unwanted or threatening email and text messages is against our [User Agreement](http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/user-agreement.html?rt=nc). To report eBay-related spam or spoof emails please forward the email to [spam@ebay.com](mailto:spam@ebay.com) or [spoof@ebay.com](mailto:spoof@ebay.com).

 **Communication tools**

We may scan messages automatically and check for spam, viruses, phishing and other malicious activity, illegal or prohibited content or violations of our User Agreement, this privacy notice or our other policies.

 **Children's Privacy**

Our websites are general audience websites and not intended for children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from users deemed to be children under their respective national laws.

 **Third Party Privacy Practices**

This privacy notice addresses only our use and handling of personal information we collect from you in connection with providing you our Services. If you disclose your information to a third party, or visit a third party website via a link from our Services, their privacy notices and practices will apply to any personal information you provide to them or they collect from you.

We cannot guarantee the privacy or security of your personal information once you provide it to a third party and we encourage you to evaluate the privacy and security policies of your trading partner before entering into a transaction and choosing to share your personal information. This is true even where the third parties to whom you disclose personal information are bidders, buyers or sellers on our site.

### Rate Card

**Payment Structure for Qualifying Transactions:** A Qualifying Transaction occurs when (1) an end user makes a purchase on a participating Affiliate website within 24 hours after clicking your Promotional Content for a “Buy It Now” item, (2) an end user places a bid on an auction within 24 hours after clicking your Promotional Content and wins such auction within 10 days for an “Auction” item, or (3) an end user makes a purchase through eBay’s API on a digital property that is owned and operated by you and that complies with all other terms and conditions of your agreement for participation in eBay’s Buy API Program. For any Qualifying Transactions, you receive a percentage of the revenue eBay Inc. earns from that purchase, based on the category-level commission rates shown below. Note that there are certain items and categories for which eBay Inc. earns low or no revenue; in such cases, you will therefore earn low or no revenue share. These items and categories may include, but are not limited to gift cards, items sold by charities, and special promotional deals. You will only be paid once for each Qualifying Transaction; no duplicate payments will be made under eBay’s Buy API Program.
