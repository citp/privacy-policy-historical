<h2 class="subhead">Cookies</h2>
<p>When you access our Site, we (including companies we work  with) may place small data files on your computer or other device. These data  files may be traditional cookies, pixel tags, "Flash cookies," or  other local storage provided by your browser or associated applications  ("Cookies"). We use these technologies to: recognize you as an  applicant; customize our services; measure the Site’s effectiveness; help  ensure that your account security is not compromised; mitigate risk and prevent  fraud; and to promote trust and safety across our sites.</p>
<p> We use both session and persistent Cookies. Session Cookies  expire and no longer have any effect when you log out of your account or close  your browser. Persistent Cookies remain on your device until you erase them or  they expire.</p>
<p>We encode our Cookies so that we can interpret the  information stored in them. You are free to decline our Cookies if your browser  or browser add-on permits, but doing so may interfere with your use of our Site.  Refer to the help section of your browser, browser extensions, or installed  applications for instructions on blocking, deleting, or disabling Cookies.</p>

<h2 class="subhead">How we protect and store personal information </h2>
<p>Throughout this policy, we use the  term "personal information" to describe information that can be associated  with a specific person and can be used to identify that person. We do not  consider personal information to include information that has been made  anonymous so that it does not identify a specific user.</p>
<p>We store and process your personal  information on our computers in the US and elsewhere in the world where our  facilities are located. We protect your information using physical, technical,  and administrative security measures to reduce the risks of loss, misuse,  unauthorized access, disclosure and alteration. Some of the safeguards we use  are firewalls and data encryption, physical access controls to our data  centers, and information access authorization controls. Although we work very  hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect,  that your personal information or private communications will always remain  private.</p>
<p>Please take care to secure both your account and password.  If you feel your account has been compromised please contact us at <a href="mailto:staffing_system_support@ebay.com">staffing_system_support@ebay.com</a>.</p>

 
<h2 class="subhead">Accessing or changing your personal information</h2>
<p>You can access, review, and change most of your personal  information by logging into the Site. Generally, we will not manually modify  your personal information because it is very difficult to verify your identity  remotely. You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or  is inaccurate. Upon your request, we will deactivate or remove your personal  information from our active databases, although some information may be  retained as permitted or required by law.</p>
<p> We may delete your personal information at any time  (including your CV/resume), without any reason. Therefore, please retain your  own copy of the personal information provided to us.</p>
<p>More detailed information about our privacy practices and  our contact information for any questions is available at the <a href="http://www.ebayprivacycenter.com">eBay Privacy Center</a>.&nbsp; If your questions are not answered online,  you may write to us at: eBay Inc. Attn: Legal - Global Privacy Practices, 2145  Hamilton Avenue, San Jose, California 95125, USA.&nbsp; </p>
