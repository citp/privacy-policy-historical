As set out above under 'Personal data from other sources', we also receive access to personal data about you from other [eBay Inc. corporate family members](https://www.ebayinc.com/our-company/our-businesses/).

### 5.7 Additional information regarding our payment services for sellers

With regard to our payment services for sellers in the EU, we additionally point out that eBay S.à r.l. is subject to professional secrecy, which requires special transparency with regard to the processing and, in particular, the transmission of your personal data. We therefore expressly draw your attention to the fact that eBay S.à r.l. may pass on your personal data to trustworthy third parties and business partners where necessary to provide our payment services for sellers, as described above in this Section 5 of the User Privacy Notice.

You will find information on your right to object to this processing of your data below under Rights as a data subject.

---|---  
 6\. International data transfers  
   
  
Some recipients of your personal data are located outside your country or have offices in countries where data protection laws may provide a different level of protection than the laws in your country. When transferring personal data to such recipients, we provide appropriate safeguards.

### 6.1 Data transfers to eBay Inc. corporate family members

The transmission of personal data between different eBay Inc. corporate family members is based on our worldwide data protection principles, which are binding internal data protection regulations (Binding Corporate Rules, BCRs), or on the basis of other appropriate safeguards (e.g. standard data protection clauses issued or approved by the European Commission (2010/87/EU, 2001/497/EC or 2004/915/EC)). Through our Binding Corporate Rules, the eBay Inc. corporate family members undertake to protect your personal data and to comply with data protection obligations. Further information on our binding company-wide guidelines and our worldwide data protection principles can be found in the [eBay Privacy Centre](https://www.ebayinc.com/our-company/privacy-center/).

### 6.2 Other data transfers (from the European Economic Area to third countries)

We will only transfer your personal data from the European Economic Area (EEA) to third countries, i.e. countries outside the EEA, on the basis of appropriate safeguards. Third countries providing an adequate level of data protection according to the European Commission currently include Andorra, Argentina, Canada (for companies covered by the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act), Switzerland, the Faroe Islands, Guernsey, the State of Israel, the Isle of Man, Japan, Jersey, New Zealand and Uruguay. Recipients in the USA can be partially certified according to the [EU-U.S. Privacy Shield](https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome), so that appropriate safeguards for an international data transfer exist. In other cases, eBay provides the necessary safeguards, e.g. through the conclusion of data protection contracts adopted by the European Commission (e.g. standard data protection clauses (2010/87/EU, 2001/497/EC or 2004/915/EC)) with the recipients, or through other measures provided for by law. A copy of the documentation of the measures taken by us is available on request.

---|---  
7\. Storage duration and erasure  
   
  
Your personal data will be stored by us and our service providers in accordance with applicable data protection laws to the extent necessary for the processing purposes set out in this User Privacy Notice (see Purposes and legal basis for data processing and categories of recipients for more information on the processing purposes). Subsequently, we will delete your personal data in accordance with our data retention and deletion policy or take steps to properly render the data anonymous, unless we are legally obliged to keep your personal data longer (e.g. for tax, accounting or auditing purposes). In Europe, the retention periods are generally between 6 and 10 years (e.g. for contracts, notifications and business letters). As far as legally permissible or required, we restrict the processing of your data instead of deleting it (e.g. by restricting access to it). This applies in particular to cases where we may still need the data for the execution of the contract or for the assertion of or defence against legal claims. In these cases, the duration of the restriction of processing depends on the respective statutory limitation or retention periods. The data will be deleted after the relevant limitation or retention periods have expired.

The specific retention periods for personal data are documented in our regional data retention guidelines. How long we retain personal data may vary depending on the Services we provide and our legal obligations under applicable national law. The following factors typically affect the retention period:

  * **Necessity for the provision of our Services**  
This includes such things as executing the User Agreement with you, maintaining and improving the performance of our products, keeping our systems secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records. Most of our retention periods are determined on the basis of this general rule.

  * **Special categories of personal data**  
If we store special categories of personal data, a shorter retention period is usually appropriate.

  * **Consent-based processing of personal data**  
If we process personal data on the basis of consent (including consent to the extended storage), we store the data for as long as necessary in order to process it according to your consent.

  * **Statutory, contractual or other similar obligations**  
Corresponding storage obligations may arise, for example, from laws or official orders. It may also be necessary to store personal data with regard to pending or future legal disputes. Personal data contained in contracts, notifications and business letters may be subject to statutory storage obligations depending on national law.

 8\. Rights as a data subject  
   
  
Subject to possible restrictions under national law, as a data subject, you have the right to access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing and data portability with regard to your personal data. In addition, you can withdraw your consent and **object** to our processing of your personal data on the basis of legitimate interests. You can also lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.

Your rights in detail:

  * You can **withdraw your consent** to the processing of your personal data by us at any time. As a result, we may no longer process your personal data based on this consent in the future. The withdrawal of consent has no effect on the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.

  * You have the right to obtain **access** to your personal data that is being processed by us. In particular, you may request information on the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned, the categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, the existence of the right to request rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing of personal data or to object to such processing, the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, any available information as to the personal data’s source (where they are not collected from you), the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling and, where appropriate, meaningful information on its details. Your right to access may be limited by national law.

  * You have the right to obtain from us without undue delay the **rectification** of inaccurate personal data concerning you. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, you have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.

  * You have the right to obtain from us the **erasure** of personal data concerning you, unless processing is necessary for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information, for compliance with a legal obligation, for reasons of public interest or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. The right to erasure may be limited by national law.

  * You have the right to obtain from us **restriction of processing** to the extent that

    * the accuracy of the data is disputed by you,

    * the processing is unlawful, but you oppose the erasure of the personal data,

    * we no longer need the data, but you need it to assert, exercise or defend legal claims or

    * you have objected to the processing.

  * You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you, which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit those data to another controller (' **right to data portability** ').

  * You have the right to lodge a complaint with a **supervisory authority**. As a rule, you can contact the supervisory authority of your usual place of residence, your place of work or the registered office of the controller.




If your personal data is processed on the basis of legitimate interests, you have the **right to object** to the processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation. This also applies to profiling. If your personal data is processed by us for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data for such marketing, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.

The exercise of the above data subjects' rights (e.g. right to access or erasure) is generally free of charge. Where requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, we may charge an appropriate fee (at most our actual costs) in accordance with the applicable statutory regulations or refuse to process the application.

You can exercise your rights as a data subject via our [contact forms](https://www.ebayinc.com/our-company/privacy-center/privacy-contact/). In addition, you are of course free to contact us in any other way.

If you would like to change your preferences regarding eBay notifications (including marketing communications), you can do so at any time in My eBay under 'Communication Preferences'. If you do not wish to receive marketing communications from us, you can also unsubscribe by clicking on the link in the email you received. For technical reasons, the implementation may take a few days. For information on how to manage your cookie and similar technology preferences, see the next section Cookies & similar technologies.

9\. Cookies & similar technologies  
   
  
When you use our Services, we and selected third parties may use cookies and similar technologies to provide you with a better, faster and safer user experience or to show you personalised advertising. Cookies are small text files that are automatically created by your browser and stored on your device when you use the Services. You can find detailed information about our use of cookies and similar technologies and your choices in our [User Cookie Notice](https://web.archive.org/pages/help/account/cookies-web-beacons.html).

Our cookies and similar technologies have different functions:

  * They may be technically necessary for the provision of our Services.

  * They help us optimise our Services technically (e.g. monitoring of error messages and loading times).

  * They help us improve your user experience (e.g. saving font size and form data entered).

  * They allow us to show you more relevant advertisements.




We use cookies and similar technologies that remain on your device only as long as your browser is active (session cookies), as well as cookies and similar technologies that remain on your device longer (permanent cookies). Where possible, we take appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorised access to our cookies and similar technologies. A unique ID ensures that only we and/or selected third parties have access to cookie data.

You are free to disable the use of cookies and similar technologies if this is supported by your device. You can manage your cookie settings in your browser or device settings. In addition, you can decide whether we may use cookies and similar technologies to show you personalised advertisements:

  * To manage the settings regarding the use of first-party cookies (and similar technologies) for advertising-related purposes, please go to [AdChoice - eBay Advertising Preferences](https://www.ebay.ie/adchoice) (you can also access this page directly via a link in the respective advertisement or the footer of our website).

  * You can find information about third-party cookies (and similar technologies) related to advertising and how to prevent their use on the following websites:

    *     *     *   * Users in the European Economic Area (EEA) can also use [Advertising and related preferences](https://www.ebay.ie/gdpr) to determine to what extent they consent to the processing of their personal data for advertising purposes via cookies (and similar technologies).




If you decide not to have your personal data processed by us for advertising purposes via cookies (and similar technologies), this does not mean that we will not show you advertisements. It simply means that these advertisements will not be personalised for you using first-party or third-party cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies.

10\. Data security  
   
  
We protect your personal data through technical and organisational security measures to minimise risks associated with data loss, misuse, unauthorised access and unauthorised disclosure and alteration. To this end we use firewalls and data encryption, for example, as well as physical access restrictions for our data centres and authorisation controls for data access. You can find further information on data security in our [Security Center](https://pages.ebay.com/securitycenter/index.html).

11\. Other important information regarding data protection

This section contains important additional information about the protection of personal data in connection with the use of our Services, including whether you are required to provide personal data.

**What happens when you share your personal data on our sites or applications?**  
Other users have access to the information you share on eBay or disclose to other users. For example, other users can see your bids, purchases, items for sale, saved interests, sellers and searches, shopfronts, Feedback, ratings, product reviews and associated comments. Other users can also see any information you chose to share in your profile.

When you use our Services, your public user ID may be displayed and available to the public and associated with all of your public eBay activity. Notices sent to other users about suspicious activity and notice violations on our sites may refer to your public user ID and specific items. Accordingly, if you use a username that allows others to identify you, these others may be able to identify your eBay activities.

To help protect your personal data, we allow only limited access to other users' contact, postage and financial information as necessary to facilitate your transactions and collect payments. However, when users are involved in a transaction, they have access to each other's name, user ID, email address and other contact and postage information.

**Your responsibilities over transactional information you receive through eBay**  
When you complete a transaction with another user (or a transaction has been cancelled, failed or subsequently invalidated), we will provide you with the other user's personal data (such as name, username, email address, contact information, postage and billing information). Independent from us, you are the controller of such data and responsible for any processing.

Unless you act for purely personal purposes, we recommend that you explain your data processing activities in your own privacy notice and protect the privacy of other users. As a seller, you must in any case comply with the applicable data protection laws and in particular protect the rights of other users as data subjects, e.g. give them the opportunity to access the personal data collected by you and demand that it be erased.

You may use the personal data that you have access to only for eBay transaction-related purposes, or for other Services offered through eBay (such as postage, fraud complaints, and member-to-member communications), and for purposes expressly consented to by the user to whom the data relates. Using personal data of other users that you have access to for any other purpose constitutes a violation of our [User Agreement](https://web.archive.org/pages/help/policies/user-agreement.html).

**Personal data relating to third parties**  
If you provide us with personal data relating to another person, you must obtain the consent of this person or the disclosure of the data to us must be otherwise legally permissible. You must inform the other person of how we process personal data in accordance with our User Privacy Notice.

**Filtering of messages sent via our messaging tools**  
We filter the messages sent via our messaging tools automatically according to certain criteria and check conspicuous messages manually if necessary. The messages are first received by us and then forwarded to the recipient. All messages are automatically filtered according to certain criteria. If necessary, conspicuous messages are checked manually by our customer service. In the event of a violation, we reserve the right to block the transmission of the message and to restrict the purchase and sales functions of your eBay account or to block your eBay account.

This is to protect legitimate interests such as protecting against fraudulent or suspicious activities (e.g. spam, viruses, phishing or other illegal activities) or enforcing our [User Agreement](https://web.archive.org/pages/help/policies/user-agreement.html) and our other [rules and policies](https://web.archive.org/pages/help/policies/overview.html) (e.g. illegal and other prohibited content), including but not limited to enforcing the [prohibition of purchases and sales outside of eBay](https://web.archive.org/pages/help/policies/rfe-spam-non-ebay-sale.html).

**Are you obliged to provide your personal data to us?**  
Some of the personal data that you provide to us (e.g. data by which we can identify you) are required to enter into the User Agreement and the Payments Services Agreement. The provision of any other personal data is voluntary, but may be necessary for the use of our Services, such as bidding, purchase and sales data to complete a transaction.

**Children's privacy**  
Our services are not intended for use by children. We do not knowingly collect personal data from users who are considered children under applicable national laws. According to our User Agreement, children are not permitted to use our Services.

**Staying signed in**  
When you sign in to your account on our Services, we give you the option to stay signed in to your account for a certain amount of time. If you are using a public or shared computer, we encourage you not to choose to stay signed in. You or any other user of the computer/browser you signed in on will be able to view and access most parts of your account and take certain specific actions during this signed in period without any further authorisation. The specific actions and account activities that you or any other user of this computer/browser may take include:

  * Bid, buy or make an offer on an item

  * Check out or add items to your cart

  * Purchase an item with PayPal using Faster Checkout (if enabled in your account)

  * View the activity header

  * View the My eBay page

  * View or edit the Watch List or order details

  * View the profile page

  * Send member-to-member messages

  * Conduct after-sale activities, such as leaving Feedback, cancelling orders, requesting returns or submitting claims




If you attempt to change your password, User ID, update any other account information or attempt other account activity beyond those listed above, you may be required to enter your password.

You can typically end your signed-in session by either signing out and/or clearing your cookies. If you have certain browser privacy settings enabled, simply closing your browser may also end your signed in session. If you are using a public or shared computer, you should sign out and/or clear your cookies when you are done using our Services to protect your account and your personal data.
