You have a choice about how we use your personal information to communicate with you, to send you marketing information, how we provide you with customised and relevant advertising, and whether you want to stay signed into your account.

**Communication preferences**

You can control the methods by which we may contact you about your account and your buying and selling activities in the [Communication Preferences](http://my.ebay.com.au/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?MyEbay&CurrentPage=MyeBayNotificationPreferences) section within **My eBay**.

When transacting with another user, the other user may request and we may provide him/her with information about you necessary to complete the transaction, such as your name, user ID, email address, contact details, postage and billing address or other information from you needed to promote the reliability and security of the transaction. If a transaction is held, fails or is later invalidated, we may also provide the other user with details of the unsuccessful transaction. The other user receiving your information is not allowed to use this information for purposes unrelated to the transaction, such as to contact you for marketing purposes, unless you have expressly consented to it. Contacting users with unwanted or threatening messages is a violation of our [User Agreement](http://pages.ebay.com.au/help/policies/user-agreement.html).

## Security

We protect your information using technical and administrative security measures to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorised access, disclosure and alteration. Some of the safeguards we use are firewalls and data encryption, physical access controls to our data centres and information access authorisation controls. If you believe your account has been abused, please contact us following the instructions in the Questions or Complaints section below.

## Important Information

This section describes some additional important information related to your use of our Services. There are just a few more pieces of important privacy information related to your use of our Services that we need to cover:

**When you share your personal information on our sites or applications – what happens?**

Other users have access to the information you share on eBay. For example, other users can see your bids, purchases, items for sale, your collections, the sellers and collections you follow, Storefronts, Feedback, ratings and associated comments. Other users can also see any information you chose to share in your profile or your collections.

Your user ID is displayed throughout eBay and is available to the public. It is connected to all of your eBay activity. Notices sent to other users about suspicious activity and notice violations on our sites refer to user IDs and specific items. So if you associate your name with your user ID, the people to whom you have revealed your name will be able to personally identify your eBay activities.

To help protect your privacy, we allow only limited access to other users' contact, postage and financial information as necessary to facilitate your transactions and collect payments. However, when users are involved in a transaction, they have access to each other's name, user ID, email address and other contact and postage information.

**How you should use the information you receive on eBay**

When you are in a transaction with another user, we enable you to obtain or we may provide you with the personal information of the other user (such as his/her name, user ID, email address, contact details, postage and billing address) to complete the transaction. We encourage you to inform the other user about your privacy practices and respect his/her privacy. In all cases, you must give the other user a chance to remove himself/herself from your database and give him/her a chance to review what information you have collected about them.

You may use the personal information that you have access to only for eBay transaction-related purposes, or for other services offered through eBay (such as escrow, postage, fraud complaints and member-to-member communications), and for purposes expressly consented by the user to whom the information relates. Using personal information of other users that you have access to for any other purpose constitutes a violation of our [User Agreement](http://pages.ebay.com.au/help/policies/user-agreement.html).

**Unwanted or threatening email**

We do not tolerate abuse of our Services. You do not have permission to add other users to your mailing list (email or postal), call or send him/her text messages for commercial purposes, even if this user purchased something from you, unless the user has given his/her explicit consent. Sending [unwanted or threatening email](http://pages.ebay.com.au/help/account/unwanted-email.html) and text messages is against our [User Agreement](http://pages.ebay.com.au/help/policies/user-agreement.html). To report eBay-related spam or spoof emails please forward the email to [spam@ebay.com](mailto:spam@ebay.com) or [spoof@ebay.com.au](mailto:spoof@ebay.com.au).

**Third party privacy practices**

This Privacy Notice addresses only the use and disclosure of personal information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to others, or if you are directed to a third party website, their privacy notices and practices will apply.

We cannot guarantee the privacy or security of your information once you provide it to a third party and we encourage you to evaluate the privacy and security policies of your trading partner before entering into a transaction and choosing to share your information. This is true even where the third parties to whom you disclose personal information are bidders, buyers or sellers on our sites.

## Questions or Complaints

If you have a question or a complaint about this Privacy Notice, our global privacy standards or our information handling practices, you can reach the Global Privacy Office in writing by sending us a letter or postcard to: eBay Inc, Attn: Legal - Global Privacy Office, 2065 Hamilton Avenue, San Jose, California 95125, USA.

"Personal information" is information that can be associated with a specific person and could be used to identify that specific person whether from that data, or from that data and other information that eBay has or is likely to have access to. We do not consider personal information to include information that has been made anonymous or aggregated so that it can no longer be used, whether in combination with other information or otherwise, to identify a specific person.

 **Changes to this Notice**

We may amend this Privacy Notice at any time by posting the amended terms on this site. All amended terms automatically take effect 30 days after they are posted. We will notify you through [eBay Messages](http://mesgmy.ebay.com.au/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewMyMessages&CurrentPage=MyeBayMyMessages) and/or via email of any material changes to this Privacy Notice.

 **Global Privacy Standards**

eBay Inc. has established global privacy standards for all eBay Inc. companies known as our Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs). They are our commitment to protect your personal information and honour our privacy obligations regardless of where your personal information is collected, processed, or stored. Our BCRs have been approved by a number of European Union privacy regulators. More information about our BCRs and our global privacy practices and principles, including information on how to contact us, is available at our [eBay Inc. Privacy Center](http://www.ebayprivacycenter.com/privacy).

 **Communication Preferences**

You can control how and when you want to receive notifications from eBay about your buying and selling activities and the methods by which we may contact you from the [Communication Preferences](http://my.ebay.com.au/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?MyEbay&CurrentPage=MyeBayNotificationPreferences) section within **My eBay**.

You can contact us to request access and find out whether any fees may apply, as permitted by law. Where you have a legal right to request access or request the correction of information, we can still withhold that access or decline to correct information in some cases in accordance with applicable law, but will give you reasons if we do so.




 **Disclosure**

There are times when we disclose your personal information to members of the eBay Inc. corporate family or other third parties. This disclosure may be required for us to operate or provide you access to our Services, comply with our legal obligations, enforce our policies, facilitate our advertising, or reduce or prevent fraud related to our Services. We minimise the amount of personal information we share to what is directly relevant and necessary to accomplish the specified purpose. As stated above, we do not disclose your personal information to third parties for their marketing and advertising purposes without your explicit consent.

We may disclose your personal information to the following entities for the purposes described below:

[ **eBay Inc. corporate family members**](http://www.ebayprivacycenter.com/about-us/corporate-family) **:**

  * provide joint content and services (like registration, transactions and customer support)

  * help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts, violations of our policies, fraud and/or data security breaches

  * guide decisions about their products, sites, applications, services and tools, and communications

  * provide customised advertising




Members of our corporate family will use this information to send you marketing communications only if you have consented to receive such communications from them.

If we were to merge with or be acquired by another company, we may share information with them in accordance with our Global Privacy Standards. Should such an event occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this Privacy Notice with respect to your personal information. If your personal information will be used or disclosed for any purposes not covered in this Privacy Notice, you will receive prior notification of the use of your personal information for the new purposes.

 **Service providers and financial institutions partners**

  * third party service providers who help us operate our Services and assist with fraud investigations, bill collection, affiliate and rewards programs, co-branded credit cards and other business operations

  * financial institution partners who may offer financial products to our users to provide joint content and services (like registration, transactions and customer support), to help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts, violations of our policies, fraud and/or security breaches, and to guide decisions about their products, websites, applications, services, tools and communications. These third party financial institution partners will use this information to send you marketing communications only if you have requested their services




 **Law enforcement, legal proceedings and as authorised by law**

  * to comply with our legal requirements, enforce our policies, respond to claims that a listing or other content violates the rights of others, or protect anyone's rights, property or safety

  * to law enforcement or governmental agencies, or authorised third parties, in response to a verified request relating to a criminal investigation or alleged or suspected illegal activity or any other activity that may expose us, you, or any other eBay user to legal liability. We will only disclose information we deem relevant to the investigation or inquiry, such as name, city, state, postcode, telephone number, email address, user ID history, IP address, fraud complaints, bidding and listing history, and anything else we deem relevant

  * to eBay VeRO Program participants under confidentiality agreement, as we in our sole discretion deem necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy or other unlawful activity. In such events, we will disclose name, street address, city, state, postcode, country, phone number, email address and company name

  * to credit bureaus as authorised by applicable law (e.g. information on late or missed payments or other defaults on your account that may be reflected in your credit report)

  * to third parties involved in a legal proceeding, if they provide us with a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, or we otherwise believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity.




 **People you authorise us to provide it to**

  * eBay users as authorised by you or your use of our Services (e.g. if you buy an item, the seller may view your email address and request and obtain your contact information – including phone number or email and postal address – to help complete the transaction)




 **Security**

We protect your information using technical and administrative security measures to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorised access, disclosure and alteration. Some of the safeguards we use are firewalls and data encryption, physical access controls to our data centres and information access authorisation controls.

 **Important Information**

There are just a few more pieces of important privacy information related to your use of our Services that we need to cover:

 **When you share your personal information on eBay – what happens?**

Other users have access to the information you share on eBay. For example, other people can see your bids, purchases, items for sale, your collections, the members and collections you follow, Storefronts, Feedback, ratings and associated comments. Other users can also see any information you chose to share in your profile or your collections.

Your user ID is displayed throughout eBay and is available to the public. It is connected to all of your eBay activity. Notices sent to other community members about suspicious activity and notice violations on our sites refer to user IDs and specific items. So if you associate your name with your user ID, the people to whom you have revealed your name will be able to personally identify your eBay activities.

To help protect your privacy, we allow only limited access to other users' contact, postage and financial information as necessary to facilitate your transactions and collect payments. However, when users are involved in a transaction, they have access to each other's name, user ID, email address and other contact and postage information.

 **How you should use the information you receive on eBay**

eBay enables you to obtain personal information of others to complete transactions and collect payments. We encourage you to disclose your privacy practices and respect the privacy of other users. In all cases, you must give other users a chance to remove themselves from your database and a chance to review what information you have collected about them.

Use the personal information that you have access to only for eBay transaction-related purposes, for using services offered through eBay (such as escrow, postage and fraud complaints), and for purposes expressly consented by the user to whom the information relates. Using personal information that you have access to for any other purpose is a violation of our policies.

 **Unwanted or threatening email**

Sending [unwanted or threatening email](http://pages.ebay.com.au/help/account/unwanted-email.html) is against our policies and constitutes a violation of our User Agreement. To report eBay-related spam or spoof emails please forward the email to [spam@ebay.com](mailto:spam@ebay.com) or [spoof@ebay.com.au](mailto:spoof@ebay.com.au).

 **Third party privacy practices**

This Privacy Notice addresses only the use and disclosure of personal information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to others, their privacy notices and practices will apply.

We cannot guarantee the privacy or security of your information once you provide it to a third party and we encourage you to evaluate the privacy and security policies of your trading partner before entering into a transaction and choosing to share your information. This is true even where the third parties to whom you disclose personal information are bidders, buyers or sellers on our sites.

 **Questions or Complaints**

If you have a question or a complaint about this Privacy Notice or our global privacy or information handling processes, you can reach the Global Privacy Office in writing by sending us a letter or postcard to: eBay Inc, Attn: Legal - Global Privacy Office, 2145 Hamilton Avenue, San Jose, California 95125, USA, or using the [Contact Us](http://ocs.ebay.com.au/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?CustomerSupport&query=482) page for your individual site.
