  * We may supplement the information we collect with information from third parties and add it to your account information. For example, as permitted by law, we may collect demographic information that is publically available, additional contact information, credit check information and information from credit bureaus as allowed by law. We may combine information you give us with information we collect from other sources and use it for any purpose disclosed in this Privacy Notice.

  * We may allow you to share information with third party social media sites, or use social media sites or other sites to create or connect to your account.

You agree that we may share your video viewing with, or obtain information about your video viewing from, third-party social media sites for at least two years or until you withdraw consent. Remember that you control the personal information you allow us to have access to through the privacy settings on that third party site and the permissions you give us when you grant us access. By associating an account managed by a third party with your eBay account and authorising eBay to have access to this information, you agree that eBay may collect, use and store the information provided by these sites in accordance with this Privacy Notice.

### Choice

You have a choice about how we use your personal information to communicate with you, send you marketing information and provide you with customised and relevant advertising.

**Communication Preferences**

You can control how and when you want to receive notifications from eBay about your buying and selling activities and the methods by which we may contact you from the [Communication Preferences](http://my.ebay.com.au/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?MyEbay&CurrentPage=MyeBayNotificationPreferences) section within **My eBay**. You can also control your member-to-member communications preferences setting and choose which newsletters and promotions you want to receive.

**Marketing**

We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. If you do not wish to receive marketing communications from us, you can unsubscribe from the link in the email you received, [change your Communication Preferences](http://my.ebay.com.au/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?MyEbay&CurrentPage=MyeBayNotificationPreferences) within My eBay or indicate your preferences within the direct communication from us.

**Advertising**

We do not allow third parties to track or collect your personal information on our site for their own advertising purposes without your explicit consent. If you do not wish to participate in our ad-customisation programs, you can opt out by following the directions provided within the applicable advertisement, or directly at our [Ad Choice program](http://pages.ebay.com.au/help/account/adchoice.html). The effect of an opt-out will be to stop targeted advertising, but it will still allow the collection of usage data for certain purposes (e.g. research, analytics and internal online services operation purposes).

**Signed in**

When you sign in to your account on our Services, we may give you the option to stay signed in to that account. If you are using a public or shared computer, we encourage you not to choose to stay signed in. You or any other user of the computer/browser you signed in on will be able to view and access most parts of your account and take certain specific actions during this signed in period without any further authorisation. The specific actions and account activities that you or any other user of this computer/browser may include, but are not limited to:

  * Bid, buy or make an offer on an item

  * Check out or add items to your cart

  * Purchase an item with PayPal using Turbo Checkout (if enabled in your account)

  * View the activity header

  * View the My eBay page

  * View or edit the Watch List

  * View order details

  * Leave Feedback

  * View the profile page

  * Send Member to Member (M2M) messages

  * Conduct after-sale activities, like leaving Feedback, canceling orders, requesting returns or submitting claims




If you attempt to change your password, user ID, update any other account information or attempt other account activity beyond those listed above, you will be asked to enter your password.

You can typically end your signed in session by either signing out or clearing your cookies. If you have certain browser privacy settings enabled, simply closing your browser may also end your signed in session. If you are using a public or shared computer you should sign out or clear your cookies when you are done using our Services in order to protect your account and your personal information.

If you withdraw your consent for the use or disclosure of your personal information for the other purposes set out in this Privacy Notice we might not be able to provide you all of the Services and customer support offered to our users and authorised under this Privacy Notice and our User Agreement.

### Access

We take steps to ensure that the personal information we collect is accurate and up to date, and that you have the ability to access or correct it.

  * You can see, review and change most of your personal information by signing in to your account. Please update your personal information immediately if it changes or is inaccurate.

  * Once you make a public posting, you may not be able to change or remove it. Upon your request, we will close your account and remove your personal information from view as soon as reasonably possible, based on your account activity and in accordance with applicable law.

  * We will honour any statutory right you might have to access, modify or erase your personal information. You can contact us to request access and find out whether any fees may apply, as permitted by law. Where you have a legal right to request access or request the correction of information, we can still withhold that access or decline to correct information in some cases in accordance with applicable law, but will give you reasons if we do so.




### Disclosure

There are times when we disclose your personal information to members of the eBay Inc. corporate family or other third parties. This disclosure may be required for us to operate or provide you access to our Services, comply with our legal obligations, enforce our policies, facilitate our advertising, or reduce or prevent fraud related to our Services. We minimise the amount of personal information we share to what is directly relevant and necessary to accomplish the specified purpose. As stated above, we do not disclose your personal information to third parties for their marketing and advertising purposes without your explicit consent.

We may disclose your personal information to the following entities for the purposes described below:

[**eBay Inc. corporate family members**](http://www.ebayprivacycenter.com/about-us/corporate-family) **:**

  * provide joint content and services (like registration, transactions and customer support)

  * help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts, violations of our policies, fraud and/or data security breaches

  * guide decisions about their products, sites, applications, services and tools, and communications

  * provide customised advertising




Members of our corporate family will use this information to send you marketing communications only if you have consented to receive such communications from them.

If we were to merge with or be acquired by another company, we may share information with them in accordance with our Global Privacy Standards. Should such an event occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this Privacy Notice with respect to your personal information. If your personal information will be used or disclosed for any purposes not covered in this Privacy Notice, you will receive prior notification of the use of your personal information for the new purposes.

**Service providers and financial institutions partners**

  * third party service providers who help us operate our Services and assist with fraud investigations, bill collection, affiliate and rewards programs, co-branded credit cards and other business operations

  * financial institution partners who may offer financial products to our users to provide joint content and services (like registration, transactions and customer support), to help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts, violations of our policies, fraud and/or security breaches, and to guide decisions about their products, websites, applications, services, tools and communications. These third party financial institution partners will use this information to send you marketing communications only if you have requested their services




**Law enforcement, legal proceedings and as authorised by law**

  * to comply with our legal requirements, enforce our policies, respond to claims that a listing or other content violates the rights of others, or protect anyone's rights, property or safety

  * to law enforcement or governmental agencies, or authorised third parties, in response to a verified request relating to a criminal investigation or alleged or suspected illegal activity or any other activity that may expose us, you, or any other eBay user to legal liability. We will only disclose information we deem relevant to the investigation or inquiry, such as name, city, state, postcode, telephone number, email address, user ID history, IP address, fraud complaints, bidding and listing history, and anything else we deem relevant

  * to eBay VeRO Program participants under confidentiality agreement, as we in our sole discretion deem necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy or other unlawful activity. In such events, we will disclose name, street address, city, state, postcode, country, phone number, email address and company name

  * to credit bureaus as authorised by applicable law (e.g. information on late or missed payments or other defaults on your account that may be reflected in your credit report)

  * to third parties involved in a legal proceeding, if they provide us with a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, or we otherwise believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity.




**People you authorise us to provide it to**

  * eBay users as authorised by you or your use of our Services (e.g. if you buy an item, the seller may view your email address and request and obtain your contact information – including phone number or email and postal address – to help complete the transaction)




### Security

We protect your information using technical and administrative security measures to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorised access, disclosure and alteration. Some of the safeguards we use are firewalls and data encryption, physical access controls to our data centres and information access authorisation controls.

### Important Information

There are just a few more pieces of important privacy information related to your use of our Services that we need to cover:

**When you share your personal information on eBay – what happens?**

Other users have access to the information you share on eBay. For example, other people can see your bids, purchases, items for sale, your collections, the members and collections you follow, Storefronts, Feedback, ratings and associated comments. Other users can also see any information you chose to share in your profile or your collections.

Your user ID is displayed throughout eBay and is available to the public. It is connected to all of your eBay activity. Notices sent to other community members about suspicious activity and notice violations on our sites refer to user IDs and specific items. So if you associate your name with your user ID, the people to whom you have revealed your name will be able to personally identify your eBay activities.

To help protect your privacy, we allow only limited access to other users' contact, postage and financial information as necessary to facilitate your transactions and collect payments. However, when users are involved in a transaction, they have access to each other's name, user ID, email address and other contact and postage information.

**How you should use the information you receive on eBay**

eBay enables you to obtain personal information of others to complete transactions and collect payments. We encourage you to disclose your privacy practices and respect the privacy of other users. In all cases, you must give other users a chance to remove themselves from your database and a chance to review what information you have collected about them.

Use the personal information that you have access to only for eBay transaction-related purposes, for using services offered through eBay (such as escrow, postage and fraud complaints), and for purposes expressly consented by the user to whom the information relates. Using personal information that you have access to for any other purpose is a violation of our policies.

**Unwanted or threatening email**

Sending [unwanted or threatening email](http://pages.ebay.com.au/help/account/unwanted-email.html) is against our policies and constitutes a violation of our User Agreement. To report eBay-related spam or spoof emails please forward the email to [spam@ebay.com](mailto:spam@ebay.com) or [spoof@ebay.com.au](mailto:spoof@ebay.com.au).

**Children's Privacy**

Our websites are general audience websites, and these and all of our Services are not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from users in this age group.

**Third party privacy practices**

This Privacy Notice addresses only the use and disclosure of personal information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to others, their privacy notices and practices will apply.

We cannot guarantee the privacy or security of your information once you provide it to a third party and we encourage you to evaluate the privacy and security policies of your trading partner before entering into a transaction and choosing to share your information.  This is true even where the third parties to whom you disclose personal information are bidders, buyers or sellers on our sites.

### Questions or Complaints

If you have a question or a complaint about this Privacy Notice or our global privacy or information handling processes, you can reach the Global Privacy Office in writing by sending us a letter or postcard to: eBay Inc, Attn: Legal - Global Privacy Office, 2145 Hamilton Avenue, San Jose, California 95125, USA, or using the [Contact Us](http://ocs.ebay.com.au/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?CustomerSupport&query=482) page for your individual site.

You can also find more information on how to contact us at our [eBay Inc. Privacy Center](http://www.ebayprivacycenter.com/contact-us).

This Privacy Policy describes how eBay International AG, with registered office at Helvetiastrasse 15-17, 3005 Bern Switzerland, collects, uses, stores, shares and protects your personal information. It applies to the eBay.com.au website and all related websites, applications, services and tools where this policy is referenced, regardless of how you access or use them. You can view a summary of this Privacy Policy at our [Privacy Summary Page](http://pages.ebay.com.au/help/account/privacy-summary.html).

Throughout this Privacy Policy, we use the term “personal information” to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal information to include information that has been made anonymous or aggregated so that it cannot be used, whether in combination with other information or otherwise, to identify a specific user.

By using eBay.com.au and its related websites, applications, services and tools and/or registering for an eBay account, you expressly consent to our collection, use, disclosure and retention of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy and in our User Agreement.

**2\. Global Privacy Standards**

Our parent company, eBay Inc. has established a set of corporate rules for privacy, known as Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs), which are the global privacy standards for all eBay Inc. companies. These BCRs have been approved by a number of European Union privacy regulators. They are a commitment by eBay Inc. to protect your personal information and honor our privacy obligations regardless of where your personal information is collected, processed or stored. Depending on where you reside, the BCRs may also provide you some additional privacy rights through your local privacy regulator or court. Some eBay-branded websites or websites may be governed by separate privacy policies. The privacy policy that applies will be the policy that is referenced by the respective website, application, service or tool. The privacy practices of our corporate family are consistent with those described in this Privacy Policy and our BCRs. More information about our BCRs and our global privacy practices and principles, including information on how to contact us with any questions, is available at our [eBay Privacy Center](http://www.ebayprivacycenter.com/privacy).

We collect the following types of personal information in order to provide you with the use and access to our websites, applications, services and tools, and for the additional purposes set out in this Privacy Policy:

  * email address, phone number, mobile telephone number, physical contact information, and (depending on the service used) sometimes financial information, such as credit card or bank account numbers;

You may choose to provide us with access to certain personal information stored by such third party websites. The personal information we have access to varies by website and is controlled by your privacy settings on that website and your consent.  By associating an account managed by a third party with your eBay account and authorising eBay to have access to this information, you agree that eBay may collect, use and store information from these websites in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**8\. Our Disclosure of Your Information**

We disclose personal information to respond to legal requirements, enforce our policies, respond to claims that a listing or other content violates the rights of others, or protect anyone's rights, property, or safety. Such information will be disclosed in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. As stated above, we do not disclosure your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent.

We also share your personal information with:

  * [Members of the eBay Inc. corporate family](https://web.archive.org/web/20141011031008id_/http%3A//pages.ebay.com.au/help/policies/ebay.com.au) to provide joint content and services (like registration, transactions and customer support), to help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts and violations of our policies, and to guide decisions about their products, sites, applications, tools, services and communications. Members of our corporate family will use this information to send you marketing communications only if you have requested their services and will use your personal information in compliance with their respective privacy policies and our global privacy standards

  * Service providers under contract who help with our business operations (such as, but not limited to, fraud investigations, bill collection, affiliate and rewards programs, website operations, and co-branded credit cards)

  * Other third parties to whom you explicitly ask us to send your information (or about whom you are otherwise explicitly notified and consent to when using a specific service)

  * Law enforcement or regulatory agencies, or authorised third-parties, in response to a verified request relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity or any other activity that may expose us, you, or any other eBay user to legal liability. In such events, we will disclose information relevant and necessary to the investigation or inquiry, such as name, city, state, postcode, telephone number, email address, User ID history, IP address, fraud complaints, bidding and listing history, and anything else we may deem relevant to the investigation

  * Credit bureaus. We may report information about your account to credit bureaus. Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report

  * eBay VeRO Program participants under confidentiality agreement, as we in our sole discretion believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity. In such events, we will disclose name, street address, city, state, postcode, country, phone number, email address and company name

  * Other business entities, should we plan to merge with or be acquired by that business entity. Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this Privacy Policy with respect to your personal information. If your personal information will be used or disclosed for any purposes not set out in this policy, you will receive prior notice.




While we use contractual and other measures to ensure protection of personal information, the laws and regulations relating to privacy and personal information protection in other jurisdictions may not be the same as, or similar to, your local privacy laws. The governments, courts, law enforcement or regulatory agencies in these other jurisdictions may be able to request disclosure of personal information through the laws of these countries. In an effort to respect your privacy, we will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement, other government officials, or other third parties without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm, financial loss, to report suspected illegal activity, or otherwise keep the community free from bad actors.

  
**9\. Information You Share on eBay**

Your User ID is displayed throughout eBay (and so available to the public), and is connected to all of your eBay activity. Other people can see your bids, purchases, items for sale, storefronts, Feedback, ratings and associated comments. Notices sent to other community members about suspicious activity and policy violations on our sites refer to User IDs and specific items. So if you associate your name with your User ID, the people to whom you have revealed your name will be able to personally identify your eBay activities.

If you access our websites from a shared computer or a computer in an internet café, certain information about you, such as your User ID, activity or reminders from eBay, may also be visible to other individuals who use the computer after you.

  
**10\. Using Information from eBay**

eBay enables you to share personal and financial information to complete transactions and collect payments. We encourage you to disclose your privacy practices and respect the privacy of other users. We cannot guarantee the privacy or security of your information and therefore we encourage you to evaluate the privacy and security policies of your trading partner before entering into a transaction and choosing to share your information. To help protect your privacy, we allow only limited access to other users' contact, shipping and financial information to facilitate your transactions and collect payments. When users are involved in a transaction, they may have access to each other's name, User ID, email address and other contact and shipping information. In all cases, you must give other users a chance to remove themselves from your database and a chance to review what information you have collected about them.

You agree to use user information only for:

  * eBay transaction-related purposes that are not unsolicited commercial messages; 

  * using services offered through eBay (such as escrow, shipping, and fraud complaints), or

  * other purposes that a user expressly chooses.




  
**11\. Cookies**

When you access our websites or use our services, we (including companies we work with) may place small data files on your computer or other device. These data files may be cookies, pixel tags, "Flash cookies," or other local storage provided by your browser or associated applications ("Cookies"). We use these technologies to: recognise you as a customer; customise services, content, and advertising; measure promotional effectiveness; help ensure that your account security is not compromised; mitigate risk and prevent fraud; and to promote trust and safety across our sites and services. For more information about why we use cookies, see [Cookies, Web Beacons, and Your Privacy](http://pages.ebay.com.au/help/account/cookies-web-beacons.html).

A few important things you should know about our use of these technologies:

  * We offer certain features that are available only through the use of Cookies

  * We use Cookies to help identify you and maintain your signed-in status

  * Most Cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session

  * You are always free to decline our Cookies if your browser permits, although doing so may interfere with your use of some of our sites or services

  * You may encounter Cookies from third parties, known as service providers, that we have allowed on our websites that assist us with various aspects of our website operations and services

  * You also may encounter Cookies from third parties on certain pages of the websites that we do not control and have not authorised. (For example, if you view a web page created by another user, there may be a Cookie placed by that web page).




  
**12\. No Spam, Spyware or Spoofing**

We and our users do not tolerate spam. Make sure to set your eBay communication preferences so we communicate to you as you prefer. You are not licensed to add other eBay users, even a user who has purchased an item from you, to your mailing list (email or physical mail) without their express consent. To report eBay-related spam or spoof emails to eBay, please forward the email to [spam@ebay.com](mailto:spam@ebay.com) or [spoof@ebay.com](mailto:spoof@ebay.com). You may not use our communication tools to send spam or otherwise send content that would violate our User Agreement. We automatically scan and may manually filter messages to check for spam, viruses, phishing attacks and other malicious activity or illegal or prohibited content, but we do not permanently store messages sent through these tools. If you send an email to an email address that is not registered in our community (via Refer-a-Friend or other tools), we will not rent or sell that email address.

  
**13\. Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personal Information**

Your password is the key to your account. Use unique numbers, letters and special characters, and do not disclose your eBay password to anyone. If you do share your password or your personal information with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions taken in the name of your account. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately notify eBay and change your password.

You can see, review and change most of your personal information by signing on to eBay. Generally, we will not manually modify your personal information because it is very difficult to verify your identity remotely. You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate. Once you make a public posting, you may not be able to change or remove it.

  
**14\. Protecting and Storing Your Personal Information**

We store and process your personal information on our computers in the United States and elsewhere in the world where our facilities are located. We protect your information using technical and administrative security measures to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorised access, disclosure and alteration. Some of the safeguards we use are firewalls and data encryption, physical access controls to our data centres, and information access authorisation controls.

We take steps to ensure that the personal information we collect is accurate and up to date, and we provide you with the opportunity to update your information through your account profile settings.

  
**15\. Closing Your Account; Retention of Personal Information**

Upon your request, and subject to the following sentence, we will close your account, and as soon as reasonably possible remove your personal information so that it cannot be viewed by other users. Removal will be based on your account activity and in accordance with applicable law. We may also close or deactivate inactive accounts, or accounts that are used in violation of our [User Agreement](http://pages.ebay.com.au/help/policies/user-agreement.html).

In general, personal information from closed or inactive accounts will be deleted or rendered anonymous as soon as reasonably possibly after the account is closed or deactivated. Under certain circumstances we may retain personal information from closed or inactive accounts for longer. Grounds for doing so would include; prevention of fraud, collection of fees owed, resolution of disputes, to enforce our eBay [User Agreement](http://pages.ebay.com.au/help/policies/user-agreement.html), or to otherwise take actions permitted by law. Under such circumstances this information will be kept as long as it is necessary and relevant for our operations, and to comply with any applicable law.

  
**16\. Third Parties**

Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to others, whether they are bidders, buyers or sellers on our websites or other websites throughout the internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you provide to them. eBay does not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.
