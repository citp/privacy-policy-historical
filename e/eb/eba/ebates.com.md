## 1\. What data we collect and why

Our vision at Ebates is to maximize the rewards for all of our members and to provide them with as many benefits as possible. The first key way in which we provide value is to forward the commissions we receive from our merchants to you. Instead of keeping these funds for ourselves, we make our money primarily from marketing partnerships with our merchants, and advertising.

When first registering with Ebates, you will be asked to provide your name, address, income and age. This information helps us understand your interests and develop an understanding of what might appeal to you. Based on these demographics, we are able to determine what types of merchants and specials would benefit our members most.

When a member shops or visits one of our merchants, Ebates may track this information to have a summary of our member's buying interests. This information will be used by Ebates to make relevant and personalized offers to our members. As with any other information that you supply to Ebates, none of the information that we collect will be released in any personally identifiable way, only in aggregate or anonymous form.

## 2\. How your information is used

We collect information to provide better, more relevant offers to you, whether it is targeted advertising, new merchants that we think our members may like, or choosing new partnerships.

## 3\. Who sees your personal information

Only a very limited number of Ebates employees ever have access to your personal information. Primarily this information is accessed to provide customer service or to send you your Big Fat Check.

We may use contractors or vendors to help us provide some of the services at our site. If we need to disclose personal information for them to provide the services, it is with the requirement that the information is kept confidential and is used only for those services.

## 4\. How we keep your information secure

Ebates uses a secure, encrypted connection (called an SSL connection. on all pages where you transmit personal data to us. The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number. on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Whenever you access any of your account pages or change any of your user information, it is done over an SSL connection to Ebates. In spite of the fact that all important data is sent over an SSL connection, you may notice that on merchant pages, the "padlock" icon in the corner of your browser sometimes does not appear. This is a display issue only, and is caused by the fact that the merchant session is running inside a frame. Rest assured that any time you enter your credit card information at a merchant site, it IS an SSL connection secure connection.

Ebates fully GUARANTEES the use of your credit cards when shopping through Ebates at any of our affiliated merchants. If, as a direct result of your shopping through Ebates, someone uses your credit card information to make fraudulent purchases, Ebates will reimburse you for any costs the credit card company charges you. Please refer to the user agreement for complete information. Additionally, all of our database servers that contain customer information reside only on Ebates' physically secured premises or in our equally secured locations at our service provider. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send email us at http://www.ebates.com/customer_care.do .

## 5\. Your privacy with Ebates

## 6\. Your privacy with our merchants and advertisers

Ebates contains links to various other sites. Each of these sites has a privacy policy that may differ from that of Ebates. The privacy practices of other websites linked to Ebates are not covered by this privacy policy.

Unless you choose to opt in to offers from a particular merchant, Ebates will not disclose any of your personal information to our merchants. If you wish to receive special offers directly from a merchant, neither this privacy policy nor our opt-out policy applies to those communications. Instead, please refer to the relevant merchant's privacy and opt-out policy. If you opt in to such communications, Ebates will provide your contact information to the merchants you request offers from. If you do not opt in to communications from a specific store, the only information that may be shared between Ebates and one of our listed merchants is information that pertains to orders in the furtherance of tracking your order and providing you with a correct reward.

3\. email newsletters and special offers from Ebates and our merchants and other partners. You always have the option of opting out of types 2 and/or 3 here.

You may also choose to what degree you would like us to contact you. When we ask for your account info, you may choose that we contact you with special offers, contact you about your orders, or not contact you for either.

It is the member's responsibility to update and maintain accurate contact information in their account. You can make changes by visiting your [account page](https://web.archive.org/web/20060615204420id_/http://ebates.com/account_edit.go) and entering corrections.
