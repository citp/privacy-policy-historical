####  Information we collect and how we use it

Our vision is to maximize your rewards and to provide you with as many member benefits as possible. The key way in which we provide value is to share with you the commissions we receive from our merchant partners in the form of Cash Back. We strive to confirm and pay your Cash Back quickly and reliably, and to improve your experience on our site and in our applications – these are the main reasons we collect information.

**Ebates.com**

When you become a member of Ebates.com, we collect your name, email address, and physical address ("Personal Information"). We use your Personal Information to track and send you Cash Back payments and generally to improve and personalize our services. We also collect non-personal information pertaining to our merchant partners you visit, the purchases you make, and the offers you view ("Transaction Information"). We use Transaction Information to process your Cash Back faster and more reliably, as well as to provide more relevant offers for you when you visit us or use our applications and services.

**Buy Now Shopping Cart Service and In-Store Offers**

When you use our Buy Now shopping cart service, we collect and store your credit card information to assist you in completing purchases quickly and efficiently (for example, so you will not have to type your credit card number to complete a purchase using a mobile device). Similarly, we collect your credit card information in connection with In-Store Offers, pursuant to which you can earn Cash Back on your offline purchases at our merchant partners. In connection with In-Store Offers, we transmit your credit card information to one of our service providers, who uses it to match offers you click with purchases you complete, enabling us to award you Cash Back. We store your credit card information in a secure manner.

**Browser Button and Mobile Application**

When you use the Ebates browser button or the Ebates mobile application, we will collect your browsing history and your Transaction Information. We share this Transaction Information as needed with our affiliate network partners and merchant partners in order to confirm your Cash Back faster and more reliably, and we use it to provide you more relevant and interesting offers. We may also share Transaction Information on an anonymous basis with our corporate affiliates (companies commonly owned by Rakuten, Inc.) in order to understand industry trends. This anonymous Transaction Information may be aggregated with other information and shared as general shopping analysis and trends.

**Social Media**

Our website includes social media features, such as the Facebook Like button and a “share this” button. These features may collect your IP address and the page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. These social media features may be hosted by us or a third party. Your interactions with social media features hosted by third parties (such as the Facebook Like button) are governed by the privacy policies of the companies providing them.

**Third Party Log-In Services**

We allow you to log in to Ebates.com and our mobile app using Facebook Connect and Google Connect. These services authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address in order to pre-populate our sign up form. These services allow you to share information about your activities on Ebates.com with others in your network. We may integrate with, and make available to you, other third-party log-in services in the future.

**Email Account Connection**

We allow you to connect your personal email account to your Ebates account in order to view your purchase confirmations on Ebates.com. We share this Transaction Information as needed with our affiliate network partners and merchant partners in order to confirm your Cash Back faster and more reliably, and we use it to provide you more relevant and interesting offers. You may choose to connect your email account to your Ebates account, or to disconnect it, by making a selection in the Account Settings section of the My Ebates portion of our site. A connection between your email account and your Ebates account is not required for you to be a member of Ebates and earn Cash Back.

####  Who sees your personal information

We share your Personal Information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell your Personal Information to third parties.

Only a very limited number of our employees ever have access to your Personal Information, which they use only to track and send the Cash Back payments you earn.

We may use contractors or vendors to help us provide some of the services on Ebates.com, some of whom may be our corporate affiliates (for instance, payment fulfillment or marketing services). If we need to disclose Personal Information for them to provide such services, it is with the requirement that such Personal Information will be kept confidential and will be used only for those services.

We reserve the right to disclose information we collect (including Personal Information) as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us or our corporate affiliates, or to protect us, our corporate affiliates, or our members from losses.

####  How we keep your information secure

The security of your Personal Information is important to Ebates. We use a secure, encrypted connection (called an SSL connection) on all pages where you access or transmit Personal Information. In addition, we encrypt your credit card information that you have given us to store, and maintain industry standard security to safeguard this information. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

####  Your privacy with Ebates

Ebates will never ask for your email address, username, password or any other Personal Information in an unsolicited phone call, email or letter. Further, any contact with Ebates customer service in which Personal Information is exchanged with a customer service representative will be used only for the purpose of satisfying your request. Any Personal Information you provide will not be recorded or used for any reason beyond that of the stated request.

If you choose to use our referral programs to tell a friend about Ebates, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend email inviting him or her to visit Ebates. We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this email and tracking the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at [customercarereply@ebates.com](mailto:customercarereply@ebates.com) or [privacy@ebates.com](mailto:privacy@ebates.com?subject=Privacy%20Inquiry%20Regarding%20Ebates.com) to request that we remove this information from our database.

If we materially modify this privacy policy, we will post a change notice in a prominent place on our site. We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review it regularly.

Ebates contains links to many other websites. Each of these websites should have its own privacy policy that may differ materially from this privacy policy. If you wish to receive special offers directly from a merchant partner, neither this privacy policy nor our opt-out policy applies to those communications. Instead, please refer to the relevant merchant partner’s privacy and opt-out policy.

####  Our policies on email

Ebates sends two types of emails to members: customer service emails required to maintain the Ebates program (such as cash back credits and payment notifications) and promotional emails containing offers. You may choose not to receive promotional emails at any time by clicking the "unsubscribe" link in any promotional email or by modifying your subscription preferences in the "My Ebates" section of Ebates.com.

We prohibit spamming by our members via our tell-a-friend capability. If you would like to report an incident of spamming using this functionality, please contact us at [privacy@ebates.com](mailto:privacy@ebates.com?subject=Privacy%20Inquiry%20Regarding%20Ebates.com). We will investigate and take suitable action.
