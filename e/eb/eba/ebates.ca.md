### What data we collect and why

Our vision is to maximize the rewards for all of Ebates Canada members and to provide as many member benefits as possible. The key way in which Ebates provides value is to share with members the commissions we receive from our affiliated stores. The information we collect (name, email address, and physical address) is used to track and send the Cash Back payments members earn.

Additionally, we may use information on the stores you visit or the offers you view on Ebates.ca to select special offers that will be relevant to you. Except at an aggregate level, however, we do not share that information with our store partners or other third parties.

Finally, Ebates Canada collects data on the devices that access or attempt to access our websites. This device data is used in conjunction with a third party security partner to identify and prevent fraudulent activity and does not include personally identifiable information.

### Who sees your personal information

Only a very limited number of Ebates Canada employees ever have access to your personal information. This information is used to track and send the Cash Back payments you earn.

We may use contractors or vendors to help us provide some of the services at our site. If we need to disclose personal information for them to provide the services, it is with the requirement that the information is kept confidential and is used only for those services. We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site or to protect Ebates Canada and its members from losses. 

### How we keep your information secure

The security of your personal information is important to Ebates Canada. Ebates.ca uses a secure, encrypted connection (called an SSL connection) on all pages where you access or transmit personal information.

### Your privacy with Ebates Canada

Ebates Canada will never ask for your username, password or any other personal information in an unsolicited phone call, email or letter. Further, any contact with Ebates Canada customer service in which personal information is exchanged with a customer service representative will be used only for the purpose of satisfying your request. Any personal information you provide will not be recorded or used for any reason beyond that of the stated request.

If you choose to use our referral program to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Ebates Canada stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at customercare@ebates.ca to request that we remove this information from our database.

If we change our privacy policy, we will post a change notice to this privacy statement and other appropriate places. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it regularly. If we make changes to this policy, we will notify you, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.

### Your privacy with our stores and advertisers

Ebates Canada does not record personal information passed from our members to affiliated stores. Order information, including order numbers and amounts, may be available to Ebates Canada, the store, or third party affiliate program management companies for accurate tracking purposes, but his information will not be released by Ebates Canada to other parties.

Ebates Canada contains links to various other sites. Each of these sites has a privacy policy that may differ from that of Ebates Canada. If you wish to receive special offers directly from a store, neither this privacy policy nor our opt-out policy applies to those communications. Instead, please refer to the relevant store's privacy and opt-out policy.

### Our policies on email

Ebates Canada sends two types of email to members: customer service emails required to maintain the Ebates Canada program (like Cash Back credits & payment notifications); and promotional emails featuring especially good offers. You may choose not to receive promotional emails at any time from My Account or by clicking the "unsubscribe" link in an email.

Ebates Canada does not support spamming by our members and we explicitly prohibit it in our Terms & Conditions. If you would like to report an incident of spamming using our tell-a-friend capability, please contact us. We will investigate and take suitable action.
