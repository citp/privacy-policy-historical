	<p class="header">1. A Special Note About Children.</p>
	<p>
		Children (persons under the age of 18) are not eligible to use the Site unsupervised and we ask that children do not submit any personal information to us. If you are under the age of 18, you may only use this Site only in conjunction with and under the supervision of your parents or guardians. 
	</p>
	
	<p class="header">2. Information We Collect.</p>
	<p>
		Our primary purpose in collecting personal information from you is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customised experience. This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customise our service to make your experience safer and easier. We only collect personal information about you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose.
	</p>
	<p>
		In general, you can browse the Site without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. If you choose to use our Site, we may require you to provide contact and identity information, billing information, shipping information and other personal information as indicated on the forms throughout the Site. Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional. You always have the option to not provide information by choosing not to use a particular service or feature.
	</p>
	<p>
		Under some circumstances, we may require some additional financial information, such as but not limited to: if you are registering using an email account at a free email service, or registering to sell on the Site. We use your financial information, including credit card information to verify the accuracy of your name, address, and other information, as well as to bill you for your use of our services. 
	</p>
	<p>
		We automatically track certain information about you based upon your behaviour on our Site. We use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behaviour to better understand, protect and serve you and our community. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our Site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our Site or not), your computer browser information, and your IP address. 
	</p>
	<p>
		We use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages of the Site to help analyse our web page flow, measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. "Cookies" are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing our services. We offer certain features that are only available through the use of a "cookie." We also use "cookies" allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session. Cookies can also help us provide information that is targeted to your interests. (For more information about why we use cookies, visit http://pages.ebay.ca/help/new/cookies-web-beacons.html.) Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted at the end of a session. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on our Site and you may be required to re-enter your password more frequently during a session. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Additionally, you may encounter "cookies" or other similar devices on certain pages of our Site that are placed by third parties. For example, if you view a web page created by a user, there may be a "cookie" placed within that web page. We do not control the use of cookies by third parties.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you choose to bid, buy or sell on the Site, we collect information about your bidding, buying and selling behaviour. We also collect other users' comments about you in our feedback area. 
	</p>
	<p>
		If you establish a credit account with us to pay the fees we charge, we collect some additional information, such as: a billing address, credit card number and credit card expiration date and tracking information from cheques or money orders. 
	</p>
	<p>
		If you choose to post messages in our Cafés, chat rooms or other message areas or leave feedback for other users, we will collect that information that you provide to us. We retain this information as necessary to resolve disputes, provide customer support and troubleshoot problems as permitted by law. 
	</p>
	<p>
		If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the Site, we may collect such information into a file specific to you. 
	</p>
	<p>
		If you register for eBay on another web site or use a web site providing a service for eBay or a web site that helps facilitate your activity on eBay, that web site may provide personal information about you and your transactions back to eBay.  
	</p>
	<p>
		For a more detailed list of information we collect from or about you, please see the <a href="http://pages.ebay.ca/help/policies/privacy-appendix.html" onclick="return openHelpLink(this.href)">Appendix</a>. 
	</p>
	
	<p class="header">3. Our Use of Your Information.</p>
	<p>
		We use your personal information to facilitate the services you request. We use personal information in the file we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on the Site to: resolve disputes; troubleshoot problems; bill your account; help promote safe trading; measure consumer interest in our products and services, inform you about online and offline offers, products, services, and updates; customise your experience; detect and protect us against error, fraud and other criminal activity; enforce our User Agreement;  and as otherwise described to you at the time of collection, use or disclosure. At times we look across multiple users to identify problems or resolve disputes, and in particular we may examine your personal information to identify users using multiple User ID's or aliases. We may compare and review your personal information for errors, omissions and for accuracy. 
	</p>
	<p>
		If you choose to list an item for sale on the Site or open a  Credit account, or otherwise provide us your financial information, we use your address and financial information to bill you and provide associated support.
	</p>
	<p>
		You agree that we may use personal information about you to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to analyse Site usage, to improve our content and product offerings, and to customise the Site's content, layout, and services. These uses improve the Site and better tailor it to meet your needs, so as to provide you with a smooth, efficient, safe and customized experience while using the Site. 
	</p>
	<p>
		You agree that we may also use your personal information to contact you and deliver information to you that, in some cases, are targeted to your interests, such as targeted banner advertisements, administrative notices, product offerings, and communications relevant to your use of the Site. By accepting the User Agreement and Privacy Policy, you expressly agree to receive this information. If you do not wish to receive these communications, we encourage you to opt out of the receipt of certain communications on the <a href="http://cgi3.ebay.ca/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?SignIn&amp;pNextPage=OptinLoginShow" onclick="return openNonHelpLink(this.href)">notification preferences</a>. You may make changes to your notification preferences at any time. 
	</p>
	
	<p class="header">4. Our Disclosure of Your Information.</p>
	<p>
		As a matter of policy, we <span class="highlight">do not</span> sell or rent any of your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. However the following describes some of the ways that your personal information may be disclosed in the normal scope of business to provide our services. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="sub-header">Advertisers.</span>
		We aggregate (gather up data across all user accounts) personal information and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for their marketing and promotional purposes. However, in these situations, we do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to identify you personally. Certain information, such as your name, email address, password, and financial information are not disclosed to these third parties in a personally identifiable manner without your explicit 
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="sub-header">eBay Community.</span>
		Your User ID is displayed throughout the Site, and is therefore available to the public. All of your activities on the Site will be identifiable to your User ID. Other people can see your bids, items that you have purchased in the past, your feedback rating and associated comments, your postings on the Site and so on. Therefore, if you associate your name with your User ID, the people you have revealed your name to will be able to personally identify your eBay activities. Although our pages are coded with robot exclusion headers, others may attempt to automatically collect your email address from our Site. We describe how to change your User ID below in Section 8. We also provide a number of ways to allow other users to find out more about you and your Site activities such as our feature that allows users to quickly see all of the items you are offering at the time. If you are involved in a transaction, we have features that allow other users to view your email address and obtain your contact and shipping information to help complete the transaction. Further, we may send out notices to you or other community members regarding suspicious activity or policy violations on the Site. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="sub-header">External Service Providers.</span>
		There are a number of separate services offered by third parties that we refer to as external service providers that may be complimentary to your use of the Site (e.g., listing agents, escrow, authentication, mediation, shipping, packaging). If you choose to use these separate services, disclose information to the external service providers, and/or grant them permission to collect information about you, then their use of your information is governed by their privacy policy. We do not disclose your personal information to external service providers unless you provide your explicit consent. With your consent we may provide some of your personal information to the external service provider offering such services, for your convenience. To prevent our disclosure of your personal information to an external service provider, you can decline such consent or simply not to use their services. Because we do not control the privacy practices of these third parties, you should evaluate their practices before deciding to use their services. Users who register on an eBay co-branded web site (for example, Compuserve or AOL) grant eBay permission to pass your email address back to that co-branded web site. The use of your email address by the co-brand web site is limited by their applicable privacy policy.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="sub-header">Internal Service Providers for Our Operations.</span>
		We may use third parties that we refer to as internal service providers to facilitate or outsource one or more aspects of the business, product and service operations that we provide to you (e.g. search technology, discussion boards, bill collection, affiliate and rewards programs, co-branded credit cards) and therefore we may provide some of your personal information directly to these internal service providers. These internal service providers' are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit their use of the personal information we provide them for any other purpose except to facilitate the specific outsourced eBay related operation, unless you have explicitly agreed or given your prior permission to them for additional uses. In some instances, the internal service provider may collect information directly from you (such as for eBay surveys or for a co-branded credit card). In these cases, you will be notified of the involvement of the internal service provider, and all additional information you provide them and their additional uses will be strictly up to you. If you provide additional information to an internal service provider directly, then their use of your information is governed by their applicable privacy policy.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="sub-header">Other Corporate Entities.</span>
		We share much of our data, including personal information about you, with our subsidiaries and joint ventures that are committed to serving your online trading needs and related services, throughout the world. To the extent that these entities have access to your information, they will treat it at least as protectively as they treat information they obtain from their other users. Our subsidiaries and joint ventures follow privacy practices no less protective of all users than our practices described in this document, to the extent allowed by applicable law. eBay, its subsidiaries, its joint ventures, or any combination of such, will share some or all of your personal information with another business entity should we plan to, merge with, or be acquired by that business entity. Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this privacy policy with respect to your personal information. If your personal information will be used contrary to this policy, you will receive prior notice in as provided in Section 12 ("Notice"). 
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="sub-header">Legal Requests.</span>
		eBay cooperates with law enforcement inquires, as well as other third parties to enforce laws such as: intellectual property rights, fraud and other rights, to help protect you and the eBay community from bad actors. Therefore, in response to a verified request by law enforcement or other government officials relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity, we can (and you authorized us to) disclose your name, city, province, telephone number, email address, UserID history, fraud complaints, and bidding and listing history without a subpoena. However, in an effort to balance your right to privacy and the ability to keep the community free from bad actors, we will not disclose additional information to law enforcement or other government officials without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when the additional disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss. Further we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your name, street address, city, province, zip code, country, phone number, email and company name to  eBay Verified Rights Owner (VeRO) programme participants under confidentiality agreement, as we in our sole discretion believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation or prosecution of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy or other unlawful activity. 
	</p>
	<p>
		 Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose personal information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the Site. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.

We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.
	</p>
	
	<p class="header">11. Privacy Tools.</p>
	<p>
		It is our goal to make our privacy practices easy to understand. We have created easy-to-read summaries, privacy principles, a privacy chart and, are working on privacy enhancing technology to help summarize our full privacy policy. If you have questions about any summary or if you would like more detailed information, we encourage you to review our full privacy policy.
	</p>

In addition, we will notify you in accordance with your <a href="http://cgi3.ebay.ca/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?SignIn&amp;pNextPage=OptinLoginShow" onclick="return openNonHelpLink(this.href)">Notification Preferences</a>.
	</p>
