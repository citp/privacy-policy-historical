We protect your information using technical and administrative security measures to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure and alteration. Some of the safeguards we use are firewalls and data encryption, physical access controls to our data centers, and information access authorization controls.

### Important Information

There are just a few more pieces of important privacy information related to your use of our Services that we need to cover:

**When you share your personal information on eBay – what happens?**

Other users have access to the information you share on eBay. For example, other people can see your bids, purchases, items for sale, your collections, the members and collections you follow, storefronts, Feedback, ratings and associated comments. Other users can also see any information you chose to share in your profile or your collections. 

Your User ID is displayed throughout eBay and is available to the public. It is connected to all of your eBay activity. Notices sent to other community members about suspicious activity and notice violations on our sites refer to User IDs and specific items. So if you associate your name with your User ID, the people to whom you have revealed your name will be able to personally identify your eBay activities. 

To help protect your privacy, we allow only limited access to other users' contact, shipping and financial information as necessary to facilitate your transactions and collect payments. However, when users are involved in a transaction, they have access to each other's name, User ID, email address and other contact and shipping information.

**How you should use the information you receive on eBay**

eBay enables you to obtain personal information of others to complete transactions and collect payments. We encourage you to disclose your privacy practices and respect the privacy of other users. In all cases, you must give other users a chance to remove themselves from your database and a chance to review what information you have collected about them

Use the personal information that you have access to only for eBay transaction-related purposes, for using services offered through eBay (such as escrow, shipping, and fraud complaints), and for purposes expressly consented by the user to whom the information relates. Using personal information that you have access to for any other purpose is a violation of our policies.

**Unwanted or threatening email**

Sending unwanted or threatening email is against our [policies](http://pages.ebay.com/help/account/unwanted-email.html) and constitutes a violation of our [User Agreement](http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/user-agreement.html?rt=nc). To report eBay-related spam or spoof emails please forward the email to [spam@ebay.com](mailto:spam@ebay.com) or [spoof@ebay.com](mailto:spoof@ebay.com).

**Children's Privacy**

Our websites are general audience websites, and our Services are not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from users in this age group.

**Third Party Privacy Practices**

This Privacy Notice addresses only the use and disclosure of personal information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to others, their privacy notices and practices will apply. 

We cannot guarantee the privacy or security of your information once you provide it to a third party and we encourage you to evaluate the privacy and security policies of your trading partner before entering into a transaction and choosing to share your information.  This is true even where the third parties to whom you disclose personal information are bidders, buyers or sellers on our sites.
