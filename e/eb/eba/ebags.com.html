<a name="3"></a></p><h4><a name="3">Does eBags share the information it receives?</a></h4>
eBags does not sell or rent any personally identifiable information about you to any third party.  The following describes some of the ways that your personally identifiable information may be disclosed:
<p>
<b>Fulfillment</b><br>
During the purchase process, we will share your information with certain intermediaries (e.g. UPS, Cybercash, Product Manufacturers) strictly to process and ship your order.
</p><p>
<b>Customer Service</b><br>
eBags uses a third party to assist us in providing customer support. In order to help you most effectively, we provide them with access to your order information.
</p><p>
<b>Promotional Offers</b><br>
At times we may present or send offers to select eBags subscribers on behalf of other parties. When we do this, we do not give that company your personally identifiable information without your consent. If you do not want to receive such communications, please edit your account preferences.
</p><p>
<b>Agents</b><br>
We employ other third parties to perform services or functions on our behalf in order to improve our site, merchandising, marketing and promotional efforts, communications or other services. Those third parties include authorized contractors, consultants and other companies working with us (collectively, "agents"). They only have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, and may not share any personal information with others or use it for any other purpose than improving eBags’ services and offerings. We may also receive information about you from other sources and add it to our information. 
</p><p>
<b>Advertisers</b><br>
We work with third party advertising companies, such as Atlas DMT, to serve and track our ads. These third parties may serve other cookies. Our advertising partners use the anonymous, non-personally identifying information they collect from our site, in the aggregate, to help us better market and serve our customers. In the event that our advertisers collect any personal information on our behalf, it will not be used by them or disclosed to any third parties.
</p><p>
<b>Third Party Sites</b><br>
You may visit other web sites, through links on our site, who may collect, use and share your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. The information practices of those websites linking from or to our site are not covered by this Policy, and we encourage you to be very cautious before you disclose your personal information to others. If you register for eBags on another web site or use a web site providing a service for eBags, that web site may provide personal information about you and your transactions back to eBags. It is possible that eBags could merge with or be acquired by another business entity. Should such an event occur, you should expect that eBags would share some or all of your information in order to continue to provide such products and services. Notice of such an event will be posted and we will require that the new combined entity follow the practices disclosed in this Privacy Policy.
</p><p>

If you want to stop receiving our emails or to specify the communications you prefer to receive, you may unsubscribe or edit your profile at any time. You can do this through any of our emails, by visiting your account preferences page or sending us an email at help@ebags.com.  
</p><p>
You may ask to have your account information removed from our active databases to prevent your information from being shared with other users; however, because we keep track of past purchases, you cannot delete information associated with past purchases. Such information will be deactivated as soon as reasonably possible based on your account activity. Also, as a security measure we "back up" the data stored on our systems, and such prior information cannot be completely removed from our databases. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personally identifiable information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your requests.

<a name="5"></a></p><h4><a name="5">Security</a></h4>
The eBags Security Pledge protects you while you shop at eBags so that you never have to worry about credit card safety. We guarantee that every transaction you make at eBags will be safe.
