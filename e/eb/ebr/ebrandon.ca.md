Privacy Policy

**Policy Overview**

eBrandon.ca is owned and operated by Sobkow Technologies. We are very concerned about the protection of online privacy for all our website visitors. This policy is intended to provide an overview of our philosophy and procedures concerning this issue. This policy applies to the website www.ebrandon.ca. 

**Information we collect**

As part of the features of this website we do collect personally identifiable information voluntarily submitted by a visitor in connection with registration or other activity. With the permission of a visitor who is 18 years of age or over, such personally identifiable information submitted in connection with a registration or other activity on our website may be used for marketing and promotional purposes. Sobkow Technologies may also grant to certain third parties access to our database as necessary in connection with services provided by such third parties to the eBrandon.ca, but such disclosures are subject to non-disclosure commitments by the third parties. Information gathered online is used by Sobkow Technologies, for internal marketing analysis and to improve our products, services and websites. 

We use "cookie" technology (where our servers deposit special codes on a visitor's computer) to track user participation. We do not automatically extract personally identifiable information in this process. The "cookie" technology will only be used to track non-personal information such as type of browser, operating system, and domain names to customize the website for each visitor and to improve the visitor's online experience. In some instances, when contact information has been provided by the visitor, we will send notices to visitors, usually in the form of an e-mail. These notices, sent periodically, will announce website upgrades, new product information, promotions and other similar admins that may be of interest to the visitor. Our mailers and other notices tell the visitor how to "opt-out" so that he or she can stop the notices at any time. 

We track and store user IP addresses each time a forum message, photo, video, classified ad, classified ad web form submission or private message are posted/sent. Combined with information from your internet provider, this information may personally identify you. This information will **only** be used in the event of a dispute between yourself and eBrandon or another third party in which the law is perceived to have been violated. 

Your e-mail address is stored in our database for each classified ad you submit. This address is only used as a means for eBrandon to relay responses to your ad from your potential buyer to yourself. That address is never directly given to another user. It is internally used to link all ads you've posted on the "View all ads from this seller" page. 

Sobkow Technologies also collect personally identifiable data, such as names, addresses, e-mail addresses, and the like, when voluntarily submitted by a visitor as part of our various special feature and contest sections. In the case of online promotions and other activities, we do not condition a child's participation on the child's disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. 

You always have the right to request that contact information regarding you or your child be deleted from our database. To request deletion of your or your child's contact information in our database, please contact us using the information at the bottom of this page for more information. 

We reserve the right to change this policy at any time by modifying this policy so all of our web customers are aware of our online privacy policy. Any questions or additional information can be obtained by contacting:
