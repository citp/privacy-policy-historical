# EBI Privacy statement < About us < EMBL-EBI

## What information does EBI collect about you?

The European Bioinformatics Institute provides bioinformatics services via this website to users around the world. When you interact with us through our web site we collect some information about your computer, your approximate location, and which of our pages you visit when you are using our services. This helps us understand where our users are located, which pages and services are popular, and how we can improve our services. Additionally, we may sometimes receive personal information about you if you choose to give us such information.

For example, if you ask us a question or sign up to be notified of news about our services, you might tell us who you are, and give us your email address. Additionally, you might submit your email address for some web services, such as BLAST or CLUSTAL Omega, that allow you to submit batch jobs or when using SOAP or REST web services.

For additional information see our full [privacy policy](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/cookies).

## How do we use your information?

We might use your information in the following ways:

  * To contact you, for example to respond to a question you asked us or to send you news about a service if you specifically asked us for such news.
  * To personalize the way our web services are presented to you. For instance if you are a registered user of one of our services that service might remember your preferred display options when you log in.



We will keep your information confidential and will only use it within the EMBL-EBI.

## Your data protection choices

We will not contact you for marketing purposes or promote new services to you unless you specifically ask us to.
