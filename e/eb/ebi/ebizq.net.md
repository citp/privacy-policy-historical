# ebizQ - the Insider's Guide to e-Business Integration

ebizQ manages the [ebizQ Web site](http://www.ebizq.net/) and the [expoQ virtual conference and tradeshow](http://www.expoq.net/). ebizQ is committed to maximizing your experience and respecting your privacy while using these two information resources.

**Gold Club Registration**  
ebizQ limits access to a portion of its premium content to members of the Gold Club. Membership in the Gold Club is freely available to anyone wishing to join. At the time of registration, we ask that you supply us with personally identifiable information that will enable us to better serve your information needs. ebizQ will not share your information with anyone without your consent, but it does reserve the right to share aggregated user statistics with any relevant outside parties. When consent is given, your information may be shared with a sponsor or exhibitor for use solely in marketing its own products and services, and such information may not be sold or disclosed to any third party at any time and in any form whatsoever.

**3rd Party Content**  
Members of the analyst and vendor communities that are not associated with ebizQ sometimes supply ebizQ with premium Gold Club content. ebizQ will notify you about the availability of this content on the ebizQ.net Web site and in e-mail messages. This content is made available to Gold Club members on the condition that they share their personal information supplied during registration with the content supplier. We will clearly delineate this content from regular Gold Club content and allow you to choose whether or not you wish to proceed.

**Live Events**  
expoQ produces free live Webinars and Audio Broadcasts on important topics in e-business integration. Attendance to live events and access to recent event archives is available only to Gold Club Members. ebizQ will notify you about the availability of this content on the ebizQ.net Web site, the expoQ virtual conference and tradeshow, and in e-mail messages. These events are often sponsored. By registering for an event, attending an event, or accessing an archived event, you agree to allow ebizQ to share the personal information you supply in your Gold Club registration with the event sponsor.

**Exhibition Hall**  
The expoQ exhibition hall contains virtual tradeshow booths where vendors display their e-business integration products and services. Inside the booths you can download white papers, read company and product information, and exciting prizes. ebizQ shares your Gold Club registration information with the vendors when you visit their booth. You can choose to not have ebizQ share your information by checking the "Exhibition Hall Privacy" box on the Gold Club Registration page.

**ebizQ &A**  
ebizQ&A is an interactive discussion forum where members of the Gold Club can interact with industry experts, members of the expoQ faculty, and share best practices with one another. Posting in the discussion forums allows other Gold Club members to see your username and email address. You can edit this setting to provide other members with additional or less personal information by [editing your profile here](http://www.ebizq.net/membership/edit_profile.html).
