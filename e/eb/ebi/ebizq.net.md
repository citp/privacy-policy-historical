By providing us with your information, we are able to cater our content and services to your interests and ensure that you receive relevant offers. Additionally, the collection and use of information helps us tailor and improve our services and communicate with you effectively as we know many of our Users and Members make use of a range of media channels. Finally, collecting and sharing your information with our Sponsors makes it possible to operate our business and provide you with free content, products, or services relevant to your professional interests.

### V. What Information Do We Collect and How is It Collected?

We only collect information with your consent. By using our Websites, you consent to the collection of information as set forth in this Policy. TechTarget is committed to data minimization. As such, we only collect the information which is necessary to facilitate the purposes and uses reflected in this Policy.

**A. Information That We Acquire From You Directly.** Users have the option to provide TechTarget with Personal Information about themselves to enable TechTarget and Sponsors to provide them with access to premium Content as well as offers, and services catered to their areas of interest. Users who do not share their information with TechTarget may continue to access the vast array of free, publically accessible Content which is readily available on the Websites and does not require a User to become a Member.

1\. **Member Information**. TechTarget collects Member Information and Supplementary Information in an effort to provide you with the best and most useful content and services, and to offer you opportunities to obtain other products and services from us and our Partners. Member Information and Supplementary Information may contain Personal Information. We collect your Member Information when you (a) provide it to us by way of your completing a registration form on one of our Websites, (b) subscribe to one of our newsletters, (c) register for one of our events, or (d) otherwise interact with, engage, or communicate with our Websites or Co-Branded Sites and any Content posted on it. The disclosure of your Personal Information is completely voluntary and we will only collect Member Information with your consent; however, once you register with our Websites, you are no longer anonymous to us. We may retain your information for as long as you choose to maintain an active account is active or as needed to provide you services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. To the extent that we combine any Clickstream Data or Supplementary Information with the information provided by you, it will be considered to be part of your Member Information.

2\. **Information About Others Who May be Interested In Our Services**. Our Websites may include an “email-a-friend” feature, which allows someone to email Content to a third party. In the event that you utilize the feature, we will only use the email address of the intended recipient for purposes of emailing the respective Content to that person. You should never share another person’s Personal Information with others without first receiving their consent.

3\. **User Generated Content**. Some Websites feature User generated Content in the form of a User review section or forum communities. In order to interact in these forums, an individual must first complete the applicable registration form. The information provided by the individual may be displayed in the individual’s public profile in our forums and can be viewed by all visitors to the Website. To ensure individuals’ privacy, we do not display any the email addresses of individuals who have commented in such forums or who have contributed such content.

**B. Information That We Acquire Indirectly**

1\. **Supplementary Information**. TechTarget may acquire Supplementary Information by using Service Providers in order to confirm your Membership Information, to further enhance the relevancy of our provision of services to you, and to ensure the accuracy of the information.

2. **Analytical, Behavioral, Log, and Clickstream Data**. We may gather certain information about your use of the Websites, such as your browser type and information about your visit and interaction with our Content.

One of the ways in which we collect this information is through Tracking Technologies such as cookies and web beacons. A cookie is a small file downloaded on to a device when a user accesses certain websites. Cookies are useful because they allow us to recognize your device and provide you with a high level of service and relevant offers. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. For more information about our use of cookies and other Tracking Technologies, please visit our [Cookie Policy](https://www.techtarget.com/cookie-policy/).

We partner with certain Service Providers to collect analytical, behavioral, log, and clickstream data and to engage in analysis, auditing, research, and reporting. We, our Service Providers, and our Sponsors may use Tracking Technologies to identify you when you are online, and to collect information about your online activities, such as the type of browser you use, the websites you visit, your IP address, geographic location, browser type and version, and the content and advertising that you find interesting. This information helps us authenticate your profile; understand your interests and how we can better serve you. Additionally, this information may be combined with information you have provided to us or that we or others have collected about you, so that we may maximize the benefit you receive from the Services and deliver advertising targeted to your specific interests on our websites and mobile applications and when you use other websites or mobile applications. Information about you also may be aggregated with other Registered Users for the purposes identified above.

Although Our Websites currently do not respond to “do not track” browser headers, you can limit tracking through these third-party programs and by taking the other steps discussed in the section entitled “ **Opting Out and Your Personal Rights**.” If you do not wish to have Tracking Technologies be used when interacting with the Websites, many web browsers allow you to stop accepting cookies and/or to warn you when a third party is trying to transfer a cookie to you. Please note that some TechTarget features and services may not be available to you if Tracking Technologies are disabled.

### VI. What is the Legal Basis for the Processing of Personal Information?

TechTarget relies on both consent and legitimate business interests for processing Personal Information. For example, TechTarget may process Personal Information with a User’s consent when a User agrees that TechTarget may place cookies on their devices, or that we can process information that the User inputs into the Websites.

On other occasions, TechTarget may process Personal Information pursuant to specific purposes which are in our interests and that enable us to enhance the services we provide. For example, TechTarget may process Personal Information pursuant to legitimate business purposes to respond to User inquiries and to fulfill User requests, to send Users relevant marketing information and offers, to complete transactions, provide customer service, send administrative information, to personalize Users’ experiences with the Websites, and where TechTarget is required to do this by law.

TechTarget also processes Personal Information when it is in TechTarget’s or a Users’ legitimate interests to do so and when these interests are not overridden by individuals’ data protection rights. These legitimate interests include providing services to enable TechTarget to provide Users with more relevant ads and content.

### VII. What Information Do Our Sponsors Collect?

Our Sponsors may include Tracking Technologies within advertisements that TechTarget serves to websites. This is in order for our Sponsors to set and read their own cookies. These Tracking Technologies are not subject to the control of TechTarget. Similarly, if you click on an advertisement on our Websites, you may be redirected to the website of one of our Sponsors. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of an websites that you visit outside of our network.

### VIII. How is Your Information Used?

We use, aggregate, and retain your information as needed to provide you with and access to premium Content, products, and services catered to your areas of interest and for other legitimate business reasons. At a high level, we use the information that we collect about you to:

• provide you with services, publications, and information that you request, access, or which may be of interest to you;  
• deliver or display content that matches your professional interests and responsibilities;  
• contact you with information about, and invitations for, products and services from TechTarget and Sponsors directed to your professional interests and responsibilities;  
• communicate with you, advertise to you or invite you to join us on social media platforms on which you participate;  
• offer you opportunities to connect directly with your peers and with providers of technologies, goods, and services that may be of interest to you; or  
• for any other purpose that we tell you about when you give us the information.

By way of example, we analyze information collected from you indirectly to (a) help us recognize your computer as a previous visitor, and save and remember any preferences that you may have while you were visiting one of our Websites or a Co-Branded Site, (b) track, accumulate and report information on our Website and Content usage to our Sponsors so that they can measure the effectiveness of advertisements and content viewed on the Website, (c) help us customize the Content you are shown while visiting the Websites and potentially other websites, (d) to help us improve our Content and Websites, (e) to personalize your user experience, (f) for the purpose of identifying trends, statistics and measurements that could contribute to the enhancement of our services, and (g) identifying market sensitivities and relative market interest in specific product categories. We may also use the information that we collect to send you satisfaction questionnaires, surveys, and marketing information. The information that we collect may also be used by TechTarget for the purposes of online behavioral advertising. For example, third parties may use the fact that you visited the Sites to target online ads for TechTarget to you on non-TechTarget websites. In addition, our third-party advertising networks might use information about your use of the Sites to help target specific technology-related or other non-TechTarget advertisements to you based on your online behavior. For information about behavioral advertising practices, including privacy and confidentiality, visit the [Network Advertising Initiative website](http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising) or the [Digital Advertising Alliance website](http://www.aboutads.info/).

TechTarget also uses the information that is collected indirectly to link Users’ activities to their Member Information. Linking User activity to Member Information allows our system to confirm a User’s identity on our Websites and to facilitate easy access to our Content by saving and recognizing Member log-in information.

In addition to providing you with our own editorial content, we offer you the opportunity to access the branded content and expertise of our Sponsors. When you choose to take advantage of our Sponsor’s content or expertise, you choose to have your Member Information shared with them as well. TechTarget and its Sponsors may use information collected from you directly to provide you with access to Content related to your interests based on your activity on our Websites and other information that you have shared with us. For example, TechTarget and its Sponsors may send you emails on topics of your interest, marketing research surveys, incentives, as well as promotional emails and direct marketing offers for products and services. We also use Member Information in aggregated form to understand our Member base, and to market our services to our customers. In addition, under certain conditions we will inform a customer of TechTarget that a pre-existing contact in their marketing and sales databases is also a Member. **By sharing your information with us, you agree that TechTarget and its Sponsors can contact you by way of email, telephone, mail or other means of communication to provide you with access to Content, surveys, direct marketing, and promotional materials in connection with your activity on the Websites.**

### IX. Who do we Share Your Information With?

TechTarget may provide Sponsors with access to reports which may include your Member Information and information about your areas of interest derived from your activity on our Websites. This may include the provision of summary reports, based on our analysis of Clickstream Data, which may include a description of your activity on our Websites and interaction with Content or related to editorial and vendor content. For example, a summary report may include a statement similar to the following “3,000 people looked at the xyz white paper this week and, of those 3,000 people, 60% clicked through to read the full white paper.” Information provided in summary reports is aggregated and does not disclose any Member Information. TechTarget may also disclose aggregated user statistics (for example, “25% of our users are interested in Networking”) to our customers, prospective customers and Partners and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. TechTarget may also provide Sponsors with access to information wherein Membership Information and Clickstream Information are aggregated to enable Sponsors to improve their marketing outreach to their target audience and to optimize their marketing strategies. TechTarget’s contractual arrangements with its Partners: (a) provide that they may use this information to contact you via email, telephone, mail or other means of communication; (b) that they must secure and protect your information in accordance with applicable law and TechTarget’s instructions, (c) implement technical and procedural safeguards to protect your information, and (d) prohibit disclosure of your information to any third parties other than agents of the Sponsors for the permitted marketing purposes set forth above, provided that the third parties have entered into contractual provisions wherein they are required to protect your information under terms in line with those that we have put in place with the Partner directly. **If you do not want this information shared, please see “Opting Out and Your Privacy Rights” below**.

In particular, our security systems include authenticated access to internal databases, regular audits of processes and procedures, scheduled reviews of overall web security, and the use of restrictions of access to Personal Information in our possession.

### XIV. General

**A. Third Party Websites.** Some of the Content made available through our Websites is hosted on the website of the respective Content Sponsor. This means that when you are on a TechTarget Site and click through to that Content, you may leave the TechTarget Site and be redirected to the site of the Content Sponsor, at which time you will be subject to the policies of the Content Sponsor.

Our Websites feature advertisements from Advertisers. In the event that you click on an advertisement posted on a TechTarget Site, you may be redirected to the Advertiser’s website and leave the TechTarget network of Sites, at which time you will be subject to the Advertiser’s policies. Please note that there are two indicators of when you have left a TechTarget website. TechTarget takes pride in streamlining the “look and feel” of its websites. When you leave a TechTarget site, the look and feel of the site will change. Additionally, the URL of the TechTarget site that you were browsing prior to clicking on the advertisement will no longer reference the TechTarget Site.

TechTarget is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those sites. Users should be aware of this when they leave our Sites and review the privacy statements of each Web site they visit that collects information. **This Policy applies only to information collected on TechTarget’s Websites**.

**B. Modifications and Amendments**. TechTarget may modify or amend this policy from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your consent. If we change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on this page in addition to updating the “Last Updated” date at the bottom of this Policy. For these reasons, we encourage you to read this Policy regularly. Your continued use of the Website or accessing Content posted on the Website shall constitute your acceptance of the modified Policy. If there will be any changes made to the use of your Personal Information in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify you by posting a notice on our Website. If you object to any of the changes, or the overall Policy, please contact us via the contact information set forth in Section XV below.

**C. Domestication and International Requests**. TechTarget requires that any individual issuing legal process or legal information requests (e.g., discovery requests, warrants, or subpoenas) to TechTarget properly domesticate the process or request and serve TechTarget in a jurisdiction where it is resident or has a registered agent to accept service on its behalf. TechTarget does not accept legal process or requests directly from law enforcement entities outside the U.S. or Canada. Foreign law enforcement agencies should proceed through a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty or other diplomatic or legal means to obtain data through a court where TechTarget is located.

**D. Translations**. The English language version shall prevail. Any translations of this Policy are provided for convenience only.

**E. Children**. Our products, services, events and offerings are directed to professionals. Our business is not directed at children, and we do not solicit or knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent. If you are not 18 or older, you are not authorized to use the Services. Parents should be aware that there are parental control tools available online that you can use to prevent your children from submitting information online without parental permission or from accessing material that is harmful to minors. If you learn that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information without consent, please contact us.
