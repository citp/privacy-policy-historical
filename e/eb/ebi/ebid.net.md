### 1) How do I register with eBid.

It's simple. Just go to [the registration page](https://www.ebid.net/us/register/), fill out the form, choose which account plan you want (BUYER, SELLER or SELLER+) and submit it. You'll receive a confirmation link by email that you'll need to click on then you will then have unlimited access to eBid.To ensure you are registering on the correct eBid site please go to the [eBid.net](http://www.ebid.net/) country selection page and select your country of residence.

Register as BUYER only you'll be able to bid and buy, not sell.

If you are listing an item for auction you will need to either upgrade to SELLER or SELLER+, see next FAQ below. A comparison of eBid account plans can be seen below also.

### 2) How do I upgrade my account?

You can upgrade immediately when you register by choosing SELLER or SELLER+ on the registration form. To upgrade any time after registering visit the "My Subscriptions" section of "My eBid". The details for each account plan can be seen below. This page will also show you what current plan you are on.

**SELLER** : upgrade fee : Lifetime $0.00

**SELLER+** : upgrade fee :7 Day $1.99   |   30 Day $6.99   |   90 Day $16.99   |   365 Day $54.99   |   Lifetime $99.98

### 3) How do I stop my subscription?

If you have a SELLER+ account and wish to cancel your subscription, go to "My eBid" > "My Subscription" and choose the "Stop My Subscription" option in the drop down menu. Please note your existing subscription will continue until its expiry date but will not be renewed on expiry. 

### 4) Why can't I see the "Stop My Subscription" option in the dropdown menu on the "My Subscription" page?

If you have a SELLER+ account and cannot see the "Stop My Subscription" option in the dropdown menu on the "My eBid > My Subscription" page, the most likely reason is that eBid do not hold a card reference against your account and therefore we are unable to rollover your subscription or collect outstanding fees. Your last subscription may have already expired. You can check your last subscription expiry at the bottom on the "My Subscription" page. To rectify the problem update your registered card using the link provided on the "My Subscription" page. If you do not wish to continue with a SELLER+ subscription, we suggest changing your subscription to Seller, which does not incur subscription fees. 

### 5) I don't think my email validation link arrived.

When you first register with eBid you will be sent an email to the email address you registered with. You will need to click the link located on this email to let us know your email address is valid. If you haven't received the validation email or have just started seeing this error message then : 

Either 

  * If you're a brand new user and do not see your validation email in your email inbox yet then please check your "Spam" or "Junk Email" folders as on rare occasions our emails are routed there. If our email does not appear to be anywhere then you should add donotreply@ebid.net to your contacts/address book and then [re-request the validation email by entering your email address or username into the Lost Password form here](https://www.ebid.net/us/help/forgotten-password/). 
  * Perhaps you typed your email address incorrectly (most common reason). It happens often. If you try and register another account on eBid it will not allow it if your email address is already in our database. So if you are able to register again then it means you typed it incorrectly the first time!. If you made a purchase and realise you used the wrong email address then use "Help > Contact Us" and we will take a look for you and attempt to merge the two accounts. 
  * If you've been a member of eBid for a while and could successfully login before today but have started see a "validation required" error then [request another email here](https://www.ebid.net/us/help/forgotten-password/). 



### 6) Why do you have to email me a validation email? I want to bid now!

We send you a validation email so that we know that you can receive email at the address you provide to us. It's our way of authenticating your registration. By doing this, we avoid problems of incorrect email addresses preventing a deal from happening, and of people registering other people without their knowledge and placing bids on their behalf. 

### 7) I want to choose my own password.

When you first register you choose your own password. It can be changed on the "My eBid" > "My Personal Details" page. 

### 8) I've forgotten my password.

If your username and password don't seem to be working, firstly check you are entering it correctly, you'll be amazed how many people mistake a small "L" for a capital "i" or have an incorrect computer clock. Secondly you can [visit our reminder page](https://www.ebid.net/us/help/forgotten-password/) where you can enter your username or email address and be sent a password reset link by email to your registered email address. The email you receive will identify the IP address of the person who requested the reset. You can [find your IP address](http://www.whatsanip.com/) here if you wish to confirm it came from you. 

### 9) I can't login to the eBid Forums area.

Logging into the eBid Forums area is done using the same username and password you use for the main eBid site. If you don't seem to be able to login this could be due to you updating your password at the Forums site without realising. This option has now been removed. Just visit the "My Personal Details" page of My eBid to change your password, this will update your details for the main site as well as the eBid Forums area. 

### 10) Do I need to give you a credit card?

**Registration is FREE.** If you are listing an item for auction you will need to upgrade your account to **SELLER** or **SELLER+** status, each will give you differing access to our selling facilities. A credit or debit card can be used via our secure payment providers. A credit or debit card is currently the only method of obtaining a Security Subscription. **SELLER** requires a free validation of your card, **SELLER+** requires a 7,30,90,365 day or Lifetime Security Subscription to be purchased. To see current SELLER+ Security Subscription prices and to upgrade view the My Subscriptions section of My eBid. 

### 11) I've been told I need to validate my account.

On the email you receive when you register there is a link you must click on that tells us you received the email ok. If you haven't done this yet then do it now. The email should arrive immediately after you register. If you haven't received the email then go to our lost password page. You can enter your username or email address here and submit. The validation email will be sent out to you again. 

### 12) I've been told my account is on Hold.

To keep eBid as clutter free to allow genuine sellers a clean and efficient marketplace in which to trade, we ask all sellers to not break our [posting rules](https://www.ebid.net/us/help_selling.php#faq-27)  
If any of your items cross this boundary, ALL your auctions will be deleted without notice and your account placed on hold. When you try and login while your account is on hold you will find you are locked out. To remove this ban, please email us using the contact form in the Help section stating the item(s) you posted to create this ban and that you will not post such items any more. Please do not email us asking us what you did wrong, a simple apology will re-open your account almost immediately whereas a long winded email conversation will waste ours and your time.  
If you state you will refrain from posting banned items and are caught a second time, the same will happen.  
If you are caught a third time your account will be locked on a permanent basis. It is up to you to read the posting rules and abide by them, users are told about the posting rules when they start an auction. "I didn't realise" won't be a valid excuse!  
Continuous negative feedback will also see your account placed on hold. Always make sure your first feedback is positive otherwise your account could be investigated.  
Holders of multiple accounts will also be placed on hold.  
Users suspected of bidding on their own auctions (shilling or shill bidding) will see their accounts placed on hold.  
Users with incomplete address details will be placed on hold. 

### 13) Is it free to join eBid?

Joining eBid is completely free, just sign up with our form [here](https://www.ebid.net/us/register/). You can be bidding within a few seconds. Once you have joined then you will have the option to upgrade to **SELLER** or **SELLER+** status to allow yourself to start selling. 

### 14) Why is my username struck out?

Your account has been placed on hold. The most common reason for this is users found to have not read our posting rules and subsequently breaking them, they will be placed on hold without notice and in many cases have all current auctions removed immediately. Please make sure you read our [posting rules](https://www.ebid.net/us/help_selling.php#faq-27) before contacting us. 

### 15) How can i change my username?

If you have registered and have made a mistake with your username or have a valid reason for changing, please contact us via the "Contact Us" tab on our "Help" index page section and if applicable we will make the necessary changes. There is a limit of 18 characters. We cannot accept spaces in the Username and characters such as stops and hyphens are not compatible, although underscores are acceptable. For security reasons, on the Help Section Contact Form please ensure you enter your registered email address.

### 21) How do I close my account?

To close your account please open a support ticket advising you wish to do so. For security reasons please ensure the email comes from your registered email address and please advise your registered telephone number. Please also ensure you have a zero account balance. Click the HELP link in the page header and follow the tab to CONTACT US. If you simply want to stop a recurring SELLER+ subscription, just downgrade to SELLER status via "My eBid > My Subscriptions". 

### 22) I've been told my account is on hold because I've reported spam.

Some eBidders have contacted us to tell us their eBid accounts are inaccessible after they have reported emails we've sent them as spam. We don't send spam so please don't report any of our emails as spam, it affects our reputation with email providers greatly when this happens. 

Please visit "My eBid" > "My eMails" and turn off any emails you don't want. Also some people have been reporting forum thread subscriptions that they asked to be sent to them as spam, please, if you don't want it don't sign up for it, and definitely don't mark it as spam when it hits your inbox. There are links on every email we send (apart from our fee invoices) to stop them being sent to you. 

### 23) Can I view the site in another language?

If you are viewing an eBid site on which the local language is NOT English then you will be able to view the site in English if you wish. Scroll to the bottom of the page and you will see a dropdown menu with English as an option, just select English and submit. 

Please note that you will be required to list your items in the local language still if you wish your items to be uploaded to Google Shopping. eg. eBid Germany, you can view the site in English but your items will need to be listed in German still. 

### 24) Can I import my feedback from another marketplace site?

See the [Feedback FAQ](https://www.ebid.net/us/help/ebid-feedback-system/#faq-8).
