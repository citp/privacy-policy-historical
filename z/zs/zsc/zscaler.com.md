**_Information We Collect Through Automatic Data Collection Technologies_**

We use cookies and various traffic tracking technologies to monitor use of the Website. A cookie is a small text file containing information that a web browser transfers to a computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes.

On the Website, we may use cookies to analyze our site traffic patterns, but except as described below under “Agents and Service Providers,” we link cookies only to IP addresses and not to any personally identifiable information (such as names or email addresses) about visitors to the Website. For example, we currently use third party services such as Google Analytics to analyze traffic to the Website. These third party services use cookies to track non-personally identifiable information, link cookies only to IP addresses, and aggregate data about traffic to the Website.

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies. Please consult your web browser's manual or online help tool if you want information on restricting or disabling the web browser's handling of cookies. If you disable cookies, you can still view the Website, but some features may not be available (such as offers regarding Products).

Web beacons, tags and scripts may be used on the Website or in email or other electronic communications we send to you. These technologies assist us in delivering cookies, counting visits to the Website, understanding usage and marketing campaign effectiveness, and determining whether an email has been opened and acted upon. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by our third party service providers on an individual and aggregated basis.

We may use Local Storage Objects (“LSOs”) such as HTML5 to store content information and preferences. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. Third parties with which we partner to provide certain features on the Website or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML5 and Flash to collect and store information.

As is true with most websites and services delivered over the Internet, we gather certain information and store it in log files when you interact with the Website or use our Products. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses as well as browser type, internet service provider, URLs of referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, information you search for, locale and language preferences, identification numbers associated with your devices, your mobile carrier, and system configuration information. Occasionally, we connect personal information to information gathered in our log files as necessary to improve the Website and Products. In such a case, we would treat the combined information in accordance with this Policy.

**Agents and Service Providers**

We may engage data processing agents and/or service providers to assist us in processing information that visitors to the Website may provide through the Website, as well as electronic messages and traffic data that are linked to IP addresses. Such third parties process data only on our behalf and are contractually obligated to refrain from using such data for their own purposes.

We may store personal information about Website visitors and subscribers in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”), the United States and in other countries and territories. To facilitate our global operations, we may transfer and access such personal information from around the world, including from other countries in which Zscaler has operations.

If you are visiting the Website from the EEA or other regions with laws governing personal data collection and use, please note that you are agreeing to the transfer of your personal information to the United States and other jurisdictions in which we operate.

In particular, we do not sell, rent or loan personally identifiable information to independent third parties.

Nevertheless, we may have to disclose information to third parties when required by law or under the good-faith belief that such disclosure is necessary in order to (i) conform to applicable law, (ii) comply with a subpoena, court order, or legal process served on us, (iii) establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims, or (iv) protect the property, interests, or personal safety of our agents, employees, customers or the public. Under such circumstances, we may be prohibited by law, court order or other legal process from providing notice of the disclosure, and we reserve the right to not provide such notice in our sole discretion.

We may disclose your personal information to a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of Zscaler's assets, whether as a going concern or as part of a bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which personal information held by Zscaler about our users is among the assets transferred. In such a case, we will provide notice before your personal information is transferred to a third party and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

We also may share your information, including personal information, with any affiliate of Zscaler for purposes of providing the Products to you.
