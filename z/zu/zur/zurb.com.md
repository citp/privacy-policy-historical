We won’t sell your personal information to anyone. There might be one exception in the event ZURB itself is sold. In this case we would transfer your personal information to our buyers so that they could continue to provide the same great ZURB service.

ZURB may disclose to authorized law enforcement personnel the personal data from anyone who poses a threat. This might include those that are attempting to commit fraud or those who conduct activities that could bring harm to others. We assume that this is not you so please don’t worry.

We require that these contractors keep the Personal Information of customers secure and confidential.

We provide a number of ways for you to “opt-out” of receiving additional information from us or having us provide your personal information to our partners. We may offer you these choices at the time you give us your information.
