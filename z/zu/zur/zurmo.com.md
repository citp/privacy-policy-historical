Due to the nature of these activities, CRM.me may collect personally identifiable information such as: your name, contact data such as your address, email address, phone number, employment and company information; and other information that you voluntarily transmit with your communication to us. We may use the information collected to provide you with additional information about our services, promotions, and upcoming events. We provide you the option to “opt-out” of any promotional emails by clicking the ‘Unsubscribe’ link present at the end of every email we send out.

### With whom we share Information

### Demo Login 

We understand that you may wish not to disclose your Personal Information for trying out our services, so we provide you the option of a Demo Login for our CRM products. The contents created by you using the Demo Login will be accessible to all persons using the Demo Login. Hence we specifically request you not to store your personal and sensitive information, files and documents while using the Demo Login as doing so would make them publicly available to all users.
