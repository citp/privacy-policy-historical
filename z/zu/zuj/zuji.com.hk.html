        <li>Accessing your Personal Information and retention of Personal Information
          <ul>
            <li>You may at any time access and change your Personal Information or subscribed services. You can easily access your Personal Information if you login as a member to ZUJI or you can follow the links that may be provided within our subscription emails to you to manage your subscription preferences. Although we will take reasonable steps to keep your Personal Information accurate, complete and up-to-date, we request that you keep your Personal Information as current as possible so that we may continue to improve our service to you.</li>
            <li>We will only withhold your access to the Personal Information in limited circumstances where it is permitted by law, such as:
              <ol type="i">
                <li>where it might be dangerous if you were to have it;</li>
                <li>where it might prejudice an investigation currently underway;</li>
                <li>where it relates to court proceedings and may be subject to the discovery process;</li>
                <li>where it may relate to a commercially sensitive decision-making process; or</li>
                <li>where other individuals' Personal Information is contained in the same record.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>You agree that ZUJI may retain your Personal Information for a period of seven (7) years from the date you last accessed your account.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Minors
          <ul>
            <li>As we cannot distinguish the age of persons who access our Websites, a blanket privacy policy is applied. ZUJI does not seek or intend to seek to receive any Personal Information from minors (i.e. children younger than thirteen years of age). Should a parent or guardian have reason to believe that a minor has provided ZUJI with Personal Information without their prior consent, please contact us to ensure that the Personal Information is removed and unsubscribe them from any promotional contact opportunities.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Tell-A-Friend
          <ul>
            <li>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our Websites, we will ask you for your friend's Personal Information including without limitation, name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit our Websites. ZUJI stores such Personal Information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Security
          <ul>
            <li>ZUJI has implemented technology and security features to safeguard the privacy of your Personal Information. A secure server protects your Personal Information. Additionally you can be assured that the information you provide to ZUJI is transmitted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption. If you become aware of any security breach, please let us know as soon as possible.</li>
            <li>We have internal procedures in place requiring our employees and data processors to respect the confidentiality of any Personal Information held by ZUJI.</li>
             <li>ZUJI will endeavour to take all reasonable steps to keep secure any Personal Information which we hold about you. Your Personal Information is stored on secure servers that are protected in controlled facilities. Unfortunately, despite the aforementioned technology and security features, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot give an absolute assurance that the Personal Information you provide to us will be secure at all times, and we cannot be responsible for any event arising from unauthorised access to your Personal Information. ZUJI will not be held responsible for events arising from third parties gaining unauthorized access to your Personal Information.</li>
             <li>Please note also that ZUJI may use overseas facilities to process or back up your Personal Information. As a result, we may transfer to and store your Personal Information at our overseas facilities. However, this does not change any of our commitments to safeguard your privacy in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Keep your password safe
          <ul>
            <li>You can play your part in safeguarding your Personal Information by never disclosing your login password or account information to anybody unless such person is duly authorized by you. Whenever you login as a member on ZUJI, particularly on somebody else's computer or on public internet terminals, you should always logout at the end of your session. Your assistance will help us protect the privacy of your Personal Information.</li>
			<li>ZUJI cannot be held responsible for lapses in security caused by third party accesses to your Personal Information as a result of your failure to keep your Personal Information private. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you must notify us immediately if there is any unauthorised use of your account by any other internet user or any other breach of security.</li>
