# Privacy Statement - Zuora

* * *

In this Privacy Statement (“Statement”), we, Zuora, Inc. (“Zuora”), describe our data collection and usage practices with respect to personal data we collect through [http://www.zuora.com](http://www.zuora.com/) and other publicly-available web pages that directly link to this Statement (collectively the “Site”). This Statement describes how Zuora collects, uses, and stores the personal information and other information you provide on the Site. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information.

This Statement only covers information collected through the Site and not information that we collect offline, through other websites, or through our subscription services. Zuora will use data loaded by customers into our subscription services in accordance with the contractual agreement(s) between Zuora and that customer.

**Information That You Provide**

You may visit the Site without registering or actively submitting personal data to us. If you do not register, then we receive only information that your computer or other device sends to us in connection with access requests and via cookies and other technologies that we use to analyze and enhance your use of our Site.

When you request information about Zuora’s subscription services, we may ask for personal information, such as your name, work e-mail, company, title, phone number, country, and industry. You can opt out of providing personal information by not entering it when asked.

Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, scripts or similar technologies are used by Zuora and our partners, affiliates, or analytics or service providers (e.g. marketing partners). These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the Site, tracking users’ movements around the Site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.

We also use cookies for advertising purposes. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our Site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our Site may be limited.

We partner with one or more third parties to display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner(s) may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this Site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you do not wish to have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt out by clicking [here](https://preferences-mgr.truste.com/) (or if you are located in the European Union click [here](https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/)). Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to receive generic ads.

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.

We use local storage, such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Site or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity also use HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.

We may not recognize or take action in response to Do-Not-Track (DNT) signals from Web browsers. At this time there is not any universally accepted standard for a company’s adoption for how to respond when a DNT signal is detected. In the event a final standard is established, we will determine how to appropriately respond to these signals.

**Information We Share**

We disclose your personal information only as follows:

– With your consent.

– Through the use of affiliated and unaffiliated service providers around the world that help us deliver our service and run our business, subject to confidentiality agreements.

– We share aggregated usage statistics that cannot be used to identify you individually.

– We will disclose data as required by law or to protect you, other users, us or third parties from harm, including fraud, data security breaches or where someone’s physical safety seems at risk.

– In a reorganization or sale of our company or assets, your data may be transferred, subject to the acquirer accepting the commitments made in this Statement and compliance with applicable law.

**Widgets**

Our Site includes social media features, such as the Facebook button and widgets, such as the Share button or interactive mini-programs that run on our Site. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy statement of the company providing it.

**Links to Other Websites**

We may provide links on our Site to certain third-party websites or referrals to certain third-parties’ products or services. If you choose to visit a third party’s website, or use its products or services, the third party’s privacy statement, and not this Statement, will govern your activities and any information you disclose while interacting with the third party.

**Unsubscribe/Opt-Out**

You can opt out of receiving our newsletter or marketing emails by following the instructions at the bottom of each communication or at any time by e-mailing [support@zuora.com](mailto:support@zuora.com).

**Data Retention**

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

**EU-U.S. & Swiss- US Privacy Shield**

Zuora participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework ([https://www.privacyshield.gov](https://www.privacyshield.gov/list)) as further explained in our Privacy Shield Notice (<https://www.zuora.com/privacy-shield-notice/>).
