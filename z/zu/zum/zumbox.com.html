<p class="legal3l2" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:52.55pt"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">5.3 <b>Use of

Information.</b> We use collected information for many purposes, including, but

not limited to, providing you the services offered by Zumbox, administering and

improving this Site, verification processing, diagnosing problems with our

systems, developing new ideas and services, and communicating with you. Except

as described in this Privacy Policy, we do not share your personally identifiable

information (including any information gathered through the account

registration process such as name and email address) with other third party

companies for their commercial or marketing use.. We do share

non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous user usage data,

referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with

interested third parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for

certain content, services, advertisements, promotions and/or functionality on

this Site. </span></p>



<p class="legal3l1" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.7in"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">We may use other

third parties such as, as applicable, credit card processing companies to bill

you for goods and services, email service providers to send out emails on our

behalf, and a third party marketing provider to provide broadcast email

services for us. When you sign up for the Zumbox services, we collect certain

personal information such as your name, street address, and e-mail address that

we may share with third parties of the type referenced above in order to best

provide the services for which you have registered.</span></p>



<p class="legal3l1" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.7in"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">From time to time

Zumbox may use third party data collection providers, like Wufoo, to gather

data or survey information. The data is transmitted securely to Zumbox and as

such, the third party does not retain the data. The collected data is used for

the pre-qualification of subscribers' service levels.</span></p>



<p class="legal3l1" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.7in"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Although you may not

"opt out" of the registration process if you wish to become a Zumbox

member, you may choose to "opt out" or �block senders� of�

promotional materials from sending you mail through Zumbox and/or its

affiliates, advertisers or other business partners If you do not "opt

out" or �block senders� of such promotional materials, Zumbox reserves the

right to release any general demographic� information regarding you to third

parties who provide goods or services that we believe may be of interest to

you, including, without limitation, to Subscribers. We will not release your

credit card information to third parties unless necessary to complete a

transaction between you and such a third party. If you decide that you would

like to discontinue receiving promotional information from such third parties,

including, without limitation, from Subscribers, please contact those third

parties directly, or contact Zumbox at <a href="mailto:support@zumbox.com">support@zumbox.com</a>.

</span></p>



<p class="legal3l1" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.7in"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Zumbox limits its own

e-mail solicitations to those customers who have not "opted out" of

receiving such communications. The solicitations are limited in that they,

among other things, will clearly indicate the originator of the e-mail and

provide the customer with a method of "opting out" of receiving

future communications of a similar nature.</span></p>



<p class="legal3l1" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.7in"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Finally,

Zumbox may use individual members' data to "pre-populate" forms which

are displayed for the purpose of collecting individual data by Zumbox and/or

its Subscribers. In no case does pre-populating a form automatically transfer

any data to any advertiser or third party. Only if the member voluntarily

requests that such data be transferred will any transfer take place � for

example, if/when a member clicks a "submit form" button.<b><i> </i></b></span></p>



<p class="legal3l1" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.7in"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Keep

in mind that, while Zumbox encourages all third parties involved � including,

but not limited to, its affiliates and Subscribers �<b> </b>to adhere to our

policies regarding the privacy of our visitors and members and to otherwise

handle personal information in a responsible manner, we cannot and do not

assume any responsibility for any actions or omissions of third parties,

including the manner in which they use information received either from Zumbox

or independently. Nevertheless, in the event that you encounter any third party

associated with, or who claims association with, Zumbox who you feel is

improperly collecting or using information about you, please contact <a href="mailto:support@zumbox.com">support@zumbox.com</a>; we will be happy to

forward your message to the third party.</span></p>



<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.7in"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Except as noted

Security Measures </span></b></p>



<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.7in"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">We take generally accepted industry security measures in order to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information we collect from you, both during transmission and once we receive it. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number, national ID) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt such information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Site, you may contact our Lead Customer Service Representative to find out more about the security measures we have implemented. </span></p>

<p class="legal3l1" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.7in"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">You

have the opportunity to opt out of receiving further communications through our

account on this Site. You may do this in several ways. To opt out of receiving

future emails or Zumbox mail from Zumbox, you may indicate your desire in the

"My Settings" area of the Site. To opt out of receiving Zumbox mail

from a specific Subscriber, you may "block" future mailings by

selecting the "block" button in the "Mail" area of the

Site. Alternatively, you may accomplish any of the above by sending an email to

<a href="mailto:info@zumbox.com">info@zumbox.com</a> or by calling us at

818-707-7400 (and mention that you have an opt-out request related to the Site)

and we will use reasonable efforts to comply with your request. Keep in mind,

however, that there will be residual information that will remain within

Zumbox's database, access logs and other records, which may or may not contain

such personally identifiable information. The residual information will not be

used for commercial purposes; however, Zumbox reserves the right, from time to
