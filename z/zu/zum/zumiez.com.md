Privacy of Children on Our Site

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") requires that we inform parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use, and disclose personal information from children under 13 years of age; and that we obtain the consent of parents and guardians in order for children under 13 years of age to use certain features of our Site. Below we explain how we comply with COPPA. When we use the term "parent" below, we mean to include legal guardians.

Information should not be submitted to or posted at zumiez.com, thestash.zumiez.com, zumiezcouchtour.com or bestfootforward.com by guests under 13 years of age. If Zumiez learns that a guest under 13 years of age has submitted personally identifiable information online Zumiez will take reasonable measures to delete such information from its databases and to not use such information for any purpose (except where necessary to protect the safety of the child or others as required by law).

Children can browse zumiez.com, zumiezcouchtour.com and bestfootforward.com without any personal information being collected. Guests under 13 years of age cannot access thestash.zumiez.com. We collect birth dates to validate the ages of our guests, including children. We do not collect any other personally identifiable information from children during our registration process. We will apply material changes in our Privacy Policy only in conformance with applicable law, including any applicable provisions of COPPA that require parental consent.

Information We Share With Others and Your Privacy Rights

When you shop or visit one of our stores or one of our websites we may share information about you to improve your shopping experience. We contract with service providers to maintain and manage our customer information, including credit card processing, shipping, name and address verification, email distribution, market research and promotions management. We provide these companies with only the information they need to perform their services and work closely with them to ensure that your privacy is respected and protected. These companies are prohibited by contract from using this information for their own marketing purposes or from sharing this information with anyone other than Zumiez. We generally do not authorize any of these service providers to make any other use of your information. In addition, when we partner with another company to offer or provide products, services, contests or promotions, we may compare our customer list with theirs to identify our common customers. Zumiez and its marketing partners may use that information to fulfill our respective obligations to you and for future promotional activities.

When we offer contests and promotions, with or without a marketing partner, you may be required to provide certain personal information in order to participate. In these cases, we will give you the choice not to receive promotional email messages or other communications from us regarding our products, services, contests, and promotions. In this case, however, Zumiez, or one of its affiliates may still need to contact you, for example, to notify winners and to fulfill promotional obligations. In the unlikely event of a sale of some or all of our business, Zumiez will disclose your personal information to a purchaser that agrees to abide by the terms and conditions of this privacy policy.

Zumiez reserves the right to disclose information about you as required by law, in response to legal process and law enforcement requests, and as necessary to protect the property, interests and rights of Zumiez, its affiliates, and others.
