# Privacy Practices | something special every day

zulily UK Limited (" **We** ") are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.

This policy (together with our Website Terms and Conditions and any other documents referred to on it) sets out the basis on which any Personal Data (as defined below) we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us. Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.

For the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998 (the **Act** ), the data controller is zulily UK Limited of 25 Eccleston Place, London SW1W 9NF.

### 1.    USER CONSENT

**1.1**     We may collect and process Personal Data (as defined in section 2.1 below) and Anonymous Data (as defined in section 3.2 below) from you when you visit our site www.zulily.co.uk (the “Website”) and when you send us information or communications.

**1.2**     By submitting Personal Data through our Website or related services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the processing of your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**1.3**     We will not disclose information about our customers to third parties except where it is part of providing a service to you, such as arranging for a product to be sent to you, carrying out credit and other security checks and for the purposes of customer research and profiling or where we have your express permission to do so, and/or as set out below.

### 2.    TYPES OF DATA WE COLLECT

**2.1**      We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data from you when you visit our Website and when you send us information or communications. “Personal Data” means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data. We collect Personal Data, as described below. 

**2.2     Personal Data you provide to us.** We collect Personal Data from you, such as your first and last name, e-mail and mailing addresses, password, and various demographic information when you sign up for a zulily Account (as defined in our Website Terms and Conditions) and make purchases on the Website. When you order Products (as defined in our Website Terms and Conditions) on our Website, we will collect all information necessary to complete the transaction, including your name, credit card information, billing information and delivery address. We will record your purchasing history. We also retain information on your behalf, such as your credit card information for future purchases and addresses you add to your address book.

If you provide us with feedback or contact us via e-mail (for example, in response to an employment opportunity posted on our Website), we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply, and any information that you submit to us (for example, a CV). If you participate in any of our surveys, promotions, contests or sweepstakes, or subscribe to newsletters or other offerings via our Website, we may collect additional profile information. When you post messages on the message boards of our Website, the information contained in your posting will be stored on our servers and other users will be able to see it.

Please note that the Act defines certain information (relating to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs or other beliefs of a similar nature, trade union membership, physical or mental health or condition, sexual life, offences, criminal proceedings, outcomes and sentences) as “sensitive data”. We do not require you to provide any sensitive data to us. However, it is possible that you may provide information that includes certain sensitive data (for example, relating to health or ethnicity) when, for example, you upload photographs which contain such data or as part of information which you provide on blogs or message boards, whether as part of a competition or otherwise. By providing such data, you agree that you are explicitly consenting to our processing such data. A link to this Privacy Policy from relevant boards and competitions will remind you of this. 

We may also collect Personal Data, such as demographic information or personal preferences, from you via other points in our Website which state that Personal Data is being collected.  We may also collect Personal Data from you at events, during personal interactions and/or by telephone. Finally, we may obtain Personal Data from other sources (such as third party websites, or any interaction you may have with us of a kind not listed above), and combine it with Personal Data already held.

**2.3     Personal Data Collected via Technology (including Cookies).** To make our Website, Products, and related services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect Personal Data from you, including your operating system and version, browser type and version, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit. As your IP address reveals your location, we may record that too. You may choose, however, not to share your geo-location information with us by adjusting your device’s location services settings. Our servers may also collect data about the pages you visit and, if you link from our Website to other websites, the addresses of such other websites.

We also use Cookies (as defined below) and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and which you viewed. Like most Internet services, we automatically gather this Personal Data and store it in log files each time you visit our Website or access your zulily Account on our network. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a website. Some are essential to make this Website work properly. Others enable us to provide a good browsing experience, help us improve services or allow us to provide you with information or offers from zulily, our affiliates or third parties that may be of interest to you. 

On our site we use four kinds of Cookies: (1) authenticated user session Cookies, which expire when you close your browser or log out; (2) user preference data Cookies, which store information about how your account is set up, in encrypted form and without storing your username or password; (3) website state information Cookies, which help show state or feature information such as image type; and (4) user tracking information Cookies, which track what users do on our site. We use the last type for internal analysis and website optimisation. 

We may use both the session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Website. In addition to Cookies, we may use web beacons, which link pages to servers and their Cookies and transmit information collected by Cookies back to servers. We may also allow certain third-party analytics service providers to include Cookies and web beacons on our Website and retain and use data so collected themselves. Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. Some web beacons can also be rendered unusable by rejecting their associated Cookies. Please note that if you choose to block cookies, this will impair our ability to recognize you as a member of zulily for purposes of allowing your access to sales events on the website and likely will prevent your ability to shop at our website

**2.4     Personal Data that we collect from you about others.** If you decide to invite others to the Website or create a zulily Account for a third party to join the Website, we will collect your and the third party’s names, e-mail addresses, and/or phone numbers in order to send an e-mail or text message and follow up with the third party. You hereby agree to obtain the third party’s consent to this before giving us their personal details, unless the person is a child is under 12, in which case such consent must be obtained from his or her parent or guardian. We will inform any third party you invite that you gave us his or her details in the invitation email.

Consent must also be obtained in the same way before you upload or post onto the Website any information or photograph which identifies any third party. The express consent of the third party must be obtained if any Personal Data considered sensitive under the Act (see section 2.2 above) is uploaded.

Please note that at any time you or the third party may contact us at [ _insert address_ ] to request the removal of this information from our database.

**5.1     Personal and/or Anonymous Data Collected by Third Parties.** Our provision of a link to any other website or location, such as the websites of our Product suppliers or payment processing service providers, is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such other website or location or its contents. When you click on such a link, you will leave our Website and go to another site. During this process, another entity may collect Personal Data or Anonymous Data from you. We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible for, these other websites or their content.

Your interaction with these programmes may allow the relevant third parties to collect data, including Personal Data, about you via cookies placed on your device when you register for their application or service.  In some cases, the third parties may recognise you even when you do not interact with their application.

You expressly consent to the sharing of your Personal Data with such contractors and other service providers for the sole purpose of providing services to you.

Such networks use information collected via cookies, web server logs or web beacons to provide customisation, auditing, research and reporting for us and for others. They collect data both on this Website and on participating third party sites. This process enhances the deployment of our marketing programmes and helps us to track the effectiveness of our advertising efforts.
