                    We are the provider of <em>Smilegate</em> Services and the organization accountable for personal data you provide as part of using the <em>Smilegate</em> Services within the meaning of applicable data protection and privacy laws. We are Smilegate West Inc., 5000 Yonge Street, Unit 1701, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M2N 7E9 (hereinafter: "<strong>SGW</strong>" "<strong>Smilegate West</strong>" "<strong>we</strong>" or "<strong>us</strong>").

                    Information on data processing by <em>Smilegate</em> </h2> <p>
                    In the following sections, we describe which of your personal data will be processed while you use <em>Smilegate</em> Services. For a better understanding, we differentiate between your basic user data (data provided by you while registering your account or communicating with us) and usage data (data automatically collected by us while you use our services).
                </p> <section> <h3>1. Basic user data</h3> <section> <h4>
                            a) What basic user data is collected and stored? 
                        </h4> <h5 class="bordered">Smilegate Account</h5> <p>
                            The use of some of the <em>Smilegate</em> Services requires you to register a user account (hereinafter: "<strong><em>Smilegate</em> Account</strong>"). If you reside outside of designated geographic areas where we provide Smilegate Services, you may be blocked from registering a user account. During the registration process, you will be asked to give us several pieces of information, in particular:
                            </p><ul> <li>Email address</li> <li>Username (pseudonym)</li> <li>Password</li> <li>Confirmation that you are 16 or older</li> <li>Date of birth</li> <li>Forum nickname</li> <li>Secret question</li> <li>Secret answer</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>
                            Forum nickname is required for you to post information on our forum. Secret question and secret answer are used for account ownership verification.
                        </p> <p>
                            To buy virtual currency for the purchase of services and gadgets in our game, further information will generally have to be provided to the chosen payment service provider in the course of the payment process. This information will be collected and processed solely by the relevant payment service provider (e.g. PayPal) in accordance with their privacy policy. We are currently cooperating with the payment service providers BoaCompra, GoCash, Fortumo, PayPal, Paysafecard, Boku, Superrewards, Persona.ly, Openbucks, Karmakoin, MTC, OneCard, Peanut Labs, PcGameSupply, Fyber, Elite4Game, Paymentwall, Tpay, Mintroute, Razer. For a successful transfer of the requested payment, the payment service provider may request from us certain personal data, processed by us, such as your IP address or user ID. Such data will be transferred to the payment service provider only when necessary to process or correct a billing matter, and will not be used for other purposes once the matter is resolved. Please read the privacy policy of the relevant payment service provider before effecting the transaction. We merely receive a transaction confirmation from the payment service provider, which confirms the payment to us and enables us, if necessary (e.g. in the event of a legal dispute), to obtain further payment details in accordance with the privacy policy of the payment service provider, in particular your name and your contact details.

                            The data will generally be stored to the Smilegate Account until the account is deleted. Where the use is subject to declarations of consent, it will be stored until receipt of a notification of revocation, but not longer than the existence of your account.
                        </p> <p> 
                            Please note that we may be obligated, on the basis of statutory obligations, in particular provisions relating to tax law and commercial regulations, to archive the relevant personal data even beyond the effective date of your revocation or deletion of your account. The data will be deleted after the relevant statutory time period. Under specific tax laws, we are obligated to store relevant information for up to ten years. For example, this is related to all information from commercial letters, invoices, and ledgers. Occasionally, these may contain your personal data.
                        </p> <p>
                            Besides those statutory obligations, we are entitled to store your personal data for specific cases. The end of the storing period depends on the purpose for which we still need your personal data. This means we store your personal data for at least the duration of our relationship with you as our customer. However, we are permitted to store personal data for longer where permitted by law, such as to bring, or defend ourselves against, legal claims. This retention period relates to the respective periods set forth by a given statute of limitation. We delete your personal data six months after you delete or revoke your account unless we are otherwise permitted or required to retain that data by law.

                                Automatically collected data includes data which is not directly related to your person or associated with your identity, such as the IP address allocated to your device at the time of access (in anonymised form), duration of access, the pages displayed and other data automatically conveyed by your PC, e.g. in the form of log files with information, in particular, your operating system, browser information, language settings, your screen resolution and your internet service provider.

                                In the course of use of our Smilegate Services we also collect a range of service related data, e.g. on the functions of a service used by you, game statistics, number of points and achievements attained, user rankings and the time which you spend on our games, IP address (both at login, as well as each match you play), MAC address, information on the hardware you are using. This information will be stored and allocated to your Smilegate Account and used for the statistical evaluation of your use (see b) below).

                                When you play online we monitor the gameplay through so called "anti-cheating software" to establish whether the user is using cheating software or is interfering with the gameplay intended by the game in any other unauthorised way (hereinafter: "cheating"). This anti-cheating software is installed together with the game on your end device.
                            </p> <p>
                                Whenever you connect to our game online, the anti-cheating software checks the course of your game, the game files, and the working memory (RAM) of your hardware (when operating) to identify unauthorised third party programs running simultaneously with your game and modifications to game files which facilitate or support cheating. "Unauthorised Third Party Programs" in this context means, for example, "add-ons", "mods", "hacks", "trainers", or other "cheats" which enable you to interfere with or modify the gameplay intended by the game or any other prohibited interference in the gameplay of the game.
                            </p> <p>
                                In the event that the anti-cheating software discovers the use of an Unauthorised Third Party Program, the game will automatically end and we will receive the information that a violation has occurred on your Smilegate Account. This notification will include information on the date, time and classification of the violation. The anti-cheating software will be deactivated when you end the connection to the game server.
                            </p> <p>
                                If you wish to withdraw your consent to the installation and use of the anti-cheating software on your device, you may no longer play the game.

Usage data can be stored in these cookies, in order to record your preferences, log-in details and settings for future visits, to identify illegal use of our services or to personalize the advertisements displayed within our services, or on the websites of other providers, to the respective user. Where necessary, cookies will be used to create links to information regarding purchases you make, pages you visit or games you play. This information will be used, for example, to track your shopping basket and ensure that you are not repeatedly shown the same advertising. Moreover, we use cookies to offer you content and advertisements that are tailored to your interests and to record your use of the website or other Smilegate Services for statistical purposes.

                                In addition to the cookies we set during your use of our service, additional cookies may be set, where applicable, by third party providers when you visit our website. This occurs because we have commissioned third parties to collect information for us, for example for statistical usage analysis (e.g. as part of Google Analytics); it also occurs because our sites contain content or advertisements of third parties. Where required, your browser connects, for the purpose of accessing such third party content, directly with the servers of the third party providers, thus enabling those providers to place their own cookies on your end device.

                                We may also store internet log files, which your PC automatically transmits to our webserver.

                                Smilegate uses its own analytical metric tool and third party analytics technologies (see more detailed information below) to collect data when you play our games. These tools and technologies collect information about your computer, browser, your operating system, your use of features and pages, any application software used and information about the manner and extent of use of our games, including game metrics and statistics and your purchasing behaviour.

                                We use Google Analytics on our websites, a web analytics tool from Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ("Google"). Google Analytics uses "cookies" which are stored on your PC and which enable an analysis of your use of our website. The information obtained by the cookies about your use of our website will generally be transmitted to a server in the USA and stored there. We use Google Analytics on our websites, however, with an IP anonymisation tool, with which your IP address, when collected by Google Analytics, will, in member states of the European Union or in other states which are party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, be masked beforehand, and thus the collected information will be exclusively transmitted by Google in anonymised form. Google uses the collected information to statistically evaluate your use of our website for us, to create reports on website activities and to provide further services related to the website and the internet usage for us. The IP address transmitted by your browser in the scope of Google Analytics will not be combined with other data from Google. Please note that Google Analytics information is often disclosed to marketing agency partners that take the data to optimize marketing campaigns.

                                You can deactivate the Google Analytics function with a browser add-on, which you can download at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. To do this you must install that browser add-on. This will prevent the analysis information from being sent to Google.

                                Clear GIFs (also known as web bugs, beacons, tracking pixels or tags) are small graphic images which are placed on a website, a web based document or in an email message. Clear GIFs are invisible to users as they are normally very small (only 1 x 1 pixel) and have the same colour as the background of the website, document or email message. We use Clear GIFs to collect statistical usage data about our websites, functions or other elements of a website. Clear GIFs also enable us to determine, for example, whether users come to our website via an advertisement placed by us and whether they register there or use a specific service. We also might use Clear GIFs in our advertising emails or in newsletters to determine whether you open these and whether you open the links therein. We use the data collected in this way for statistical purposes in order to analyse and improve our advertising campaigns and other customer communications. Where necessary, we also use this information to tailor the advertisements displayed within our Services to your specific interests by assigning you to certain interest groups on the basis of this information.

                                The data will generally at least be stored to the Smilegate Account until the account is deleted. Where the use is subject to declarations of consent, it will at least continue until receipt of a notification of revocation but not longer than the existence of your account.

                                We may be obliged on the basis of statutory obligations, in particular provisions relating to tax law and commercial regulations, to archive the relevant personal data even beyond the effective date of your revocation or the deletion of the account. The data will be deleted after the relevant statutory time period. Under specific tax laws, we are obligated to store relevant information for up to ten years. For example, this is related to all information from commercial letters, invoices, and ledgers. Occasionally, these may contain your personal data. 
                            </p> <p>
                                Besides those statutory obligations, we are entitled to store your personal data for specific cases. The end of the storing period depends on the purpose for which we still need your personal data. This means we are storing your personal data at least for the time of a contractual relationship with you as our customer. However, we are permitted to store information, including your personal data, for longer if necessary to bring or defend ourselves against legal claims in court. This retention period relates to the respective periods set forth by a given statute of limitation. We delete your personal data six months after you delete or revoke your account unless we are otherwise permitted or required to retain that data by law.

To this end, we use, among other things, state of the art encryption methods.

                            We are allowed to use your personal information where you have specifically consented. In order for your consent to be valid:

                               You should only be asked to consent to one thing at a time – we therefore avoid "bundling" consents together so that you don't know exactly what you're agreeing to; and

                                You need to take positive and affirmative action in giving us your consent – for example, we could provide a tick box for you to check so that this requirement is met in a clear and unambiguous fashion.

                            a) Right to object
                        </h4> <p>
                           This right enables you to object to us processing your personal information where we do so for one of the following reasons: 
                           </p><ol type="i"> <li>
                                    because it is in our legitimate interests to do so (for further information, please see the section "Legal bases for processing your personal information" above);
                                </li> <li>
                                  to enable us to perform a task in the public interest or exercise official authority;

                                    to send you direct marketing materials; or
                                </li> <li>
                                    for scientific, historical, research, or statistical purposes.

                            b) Right to withdraw consent
                        </h4> <p>
                            Where we have obtained your consent to process your personal information for certain activities (for example, to provide you with marketing and advertisements), you may withdraw this consent at any time and we will cease to use your personal information for those purposes unless we consider that there is an alternative legal basis to justify our continued processing of your personal information for this purpose, in which case we will inform you of this condition.

                            c) Data subject access requests

                           You may ask us for a copy of the information we hold about you at any time, and request us to modify, update or delete such information. If we provide you with access to the information we hold about you, we will not charge you for this as required by law. If you request further copies of this information from us, we may charge you a reasonable administrative cost as permitted by law. Where we are legally permitted to do so, we may refuse your request. If we refuse your request we will always tell you the reasons for doing so.

                            d) Right to erasure
                        </h4> <p>
                           Users in the EU have the right to request that we "erase" your personal information in certain circumstances. Normally, this right exists where:
                           </p><ol type="a"> <li>
                                    The information is no longer necessary; 
                                </li> <li>
                                    You have withdrawn your consent to us using your personal information, and there is no other valid reason for us to continue; 
                                </li> <li>
                                   The personal information has been processed unlawfully; 
                                </li> <li>
                                  It is necessary for the personal information to be erased in order for us to comply with our obligations under law; or 
                                </li> <li>
                                    You object to the processing and we are unable to demonstrate overriding legitimate grounds for our continued processing.
                                </li> </ol> <p></p> <p>
                            We would only be entitled to refuse to comply with your request for erasure in limited circumstances and we will always tell you our reason for doing so. 
                        </p> <p>
                           When complying with a valid request for the erasure of information we will take all reasonably practicable steps to delete the relevant information. 
                        </p> <p>
                            If we have shared your personal information with third parties, we will notify them about the erasure unless this is impossible or involves disproportionate effort.

                            e) Right to restrict processing
                        </h4> <p>
                            You have the right to request that we restrict our processing of your personal information in certain circumstances. For example, you may dispute the accuracy of the personal information that we hold about you or you may object to our processing of your personal information for our legitimate interests. If we have shared your personal information with third parties, we will notify them about the restricted processing unless this is impossible or involves disproportionate effort. We will, of course, notify you before lifting any restriction on processing your personal information.

                            f) Right to rectification
                        </h4> <p>
                            You have the right to request that we rectify any inaccurate or incomplete personal information that we hold about you. If we have shared this personal information with third parties, we will notify them about the rectification unless this is impossible or involves disproportionate effort. You may also request details of third parties to whom we have disclosed the inaccurate or incomplete personal information. Where we think that it is reasonable for us not to comply with your request, we will explain our reasons for this decision.

                            g) Right of data portability: 
                        </h4> <p>
                            Users in the EU have the right to receive your data in a structured, commonly used machine-readable format so that you can transmit your data to another service provider. In effect, this means that you are able to transfer the details we hold about you to another third party. Where technically feasible for us, we may transfer the data for you, if you instruct us to do so.
                        </p> </section> <section> <h4>
                            h) Right to complain: 
                        </h4> <p>
                            You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority. Contact details for the various EU privacy supervisory authorities can be found here depending on your country of residence:  http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/item-detail.cfm?item_id=612080.
