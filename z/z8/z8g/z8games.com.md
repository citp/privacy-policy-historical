# Z8Games - Free Gaming. Evolved.

This Privacy Policy provides guidance on how Smilegate West, Inc. (“SGW,” “we,” or “us”) collects, stores, and uses the information you provide us when accessing our games and services (“Services”). SGW includes its Affiliates, which shall mean subsidiaries, parent companies, joint ventures and other corporate entities under common ownership.

By using our Services, you signify your agreement with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use our Services.

If you access our games from a third party Social Networking Site ("SNS"), you may be required to also read and accept the SNS Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. 

Please be aware that advertisers or websites with links to and from our sites may collect personal information about you. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and cannot control the activities of, those other advertisers or websites.

If you are a visitor from outside Canada, the personal information you provide may be transferred to, stored, and processed within Canada, the United States or other countries where SGW maintains facilities or business operations.

##### What types of information may we collect?

Personal information means information that can be used to identify and contact you. You do not need to submit personal information to access certain areas of our Services, but if you do not want to disclose certain personal information to us, you will not be able to access areas of our Services that require your personal information.

We collect personal information when you create an account with us; subscribe to newsletters; participate in surveys, participate in contests, or other promotions; make purchases from us; or receive customer or technical support.

##### Registration Information

To create an account with us, we require you to provide information including gender, date of birth and email address. We may also allow you to “register” with us by using Facebook Connect or other SNS authentication options to create an account or profile within the Service.

We may also offer you the option to complete a user profile that is visible to other SGW users. Your user profile may include: a profile photo; username; your gender; biographic details that you provide; links to your profiles on various SNS; and details about the games you play.

When you play one of SGW’s games, SGW also collects and stores certain information that you provide directly or through the SNS or other third party website that is offering our game(s). We also collect information about your play and interaction with other players and the Service. 

##### Payment Information

If you purchase a license to use in-game virtual currency or virtual items directly from SGW, we will collect the billing and financial information necessary to process your charges, which may include your postal and e-mail addresses. SGW may also receive the billing and payment information that you provide when your purchase is processed by another party, such as Facebook. Purchases of third party credits or currencies like Facebook Credits may also be subject to additional policies.

##### Information about you received from an SNS

When you use any SGW game at an SNS such as Facebook, you allow SGW to access certain information from your profile for that site. The information you allow SGW to access varies by game and SNS, and it is affected by the privacy settings you establish at the SNS. For example, SGW may access and store some or all of the following information, as allowed by you, the SNS and your preferences:

  * your first and last name
  * your profile picture or its URL
  * your user ID number, which is linked to publicly available information such as name and profile photo
  * the user ID numbers and other public data for your friends
  * the login e-mail you provided to that SNS when you registered
  * your physical location and that of your access devices
  * your gender
  * your birthday



By playing a SGW game through an SNS, you are authorizing SGW to collect, store, and use in accordance with this Privacy Policy any and all information that you agreed the SNS could provide to SGW.

##### How do we use your personal information?

The personal information you provide SGW will allow us to fulfill your product or service order and to communicate with you. 

SGW may enhance or merge the personal information collected by SGW with data from third parties (such as an SNS) in order to update your contact information, perform market analysis, or improve our products, services, or systems. SGW may also provide your personal information to other companies or organizations that offer products or services that may be of interest to you. In such cases, we will notify you that the information will be shared and provide you with an opportunity to opt-out. We may also use your personal information for internal marketing, profiling, or demographic purposes, so we can adapt our products and services to better suit your needs.

##### Information we receive or collect when you access SGW games on a mobile device

If you play SGW games on your mobile telephone or other mobile device, including tablets, we collect mobile device identifiers, including MAC Address, and IP Address. In certain games we will create and assign to your device an identifier that is similar to an account number. We may collect the name you have associated with your device, device type, telephone number, country, and any other information you choose to provide, such as user name, character name, geo-location or e-mail address. We may also access your contacts to enable you to invite friends to join you in the Service.

##### What type of communications may I receive?

Offers and Updates. We will occasionally send you information on products, services, special deals, and promotions. You can opt out of these announcements.

Service Announcements. We will send you service-related announcements when necessary. For example, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.

Customer Service. We will communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. 

##### Who is collecting your information?

When you are asked for information while on a SGW site, you are sharing that information with SGW’s Affiliates, unless specifically stated otherwise. As a result, you may receive communications from any of our Affiliates. 

In addition, some services are provided in conjunction with partner companies. If your personal information is being collected by another company other than SGW, you will be notified at the time the information is collected. If you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that particular service or by not providing any information at that time. Please be aware that we cannot control the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and as such we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as SGW.

##### With whom may your personal information be shared?

SGW may need to disclose your personal information to third party vendors to fulfill product orders or prizes, to process mailings, or to process, analyze, and/or store data on SGW’s behalf. We will attempt to ensure that these entities do not use your personal information for any other purpose, and that they have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal information they obtain from us. 

We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law or in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against you if you violate the Terms of Use, or may be causing injury to or interference (intentionally or unintentionally) with SGW’s rights or property, other users of the our Service, or anyone else who could be harmed by your activities. We also reserve the right to disclose your personal information if we have a good faith belief that it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activities.

Your personal information is also an asset of SGW and will become part of our normal business records. As such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible. Similarly, in the event of a merger, sale of all or certain assets, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to SGW’s successor or assign. If material changes to SGW's privacy practices will occur as a result of the business transition, we will notify you and other users of the business transition prior to transferring your personal information.

SGW sites may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another. When posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, please be aware that the information is being made publicly available on-line and the user does so at his or her own risk.

##### What choices do I have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of my personal information?

SGW allows you to control the way that we use personal identifying information that we might obtain. At the time you provide personal information, SGW may give you the option of declining any future offers or information about new products, promotions, or services. In addition, you may “opt out” of certain features or functionality.

##### What about children?

Once a child states that his/her age is under 13, we do not collect or store any personally identifiable information. In the event that we learn that we have inadvertently gathered personal information from children under the age of 13, we will take reasonable measures to promptly erase such information from our records.

##### What are cookies and how are they used?

Cookies are a feature of your web browser that allows websites to transfer information to your computer for record-keeping purposes. Cookies allows us to speed up your future activities, saving the time you would normally spend entering information such as your password or registration. In addition, SGW may use cookies to retrieve user information for promotional, marketing, or security purposes.

##### What are Internet protocol addresses?

An Internet protocol ("IP") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider ("ISP"). SGW may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused.

##### What do I do if I want to correct or delete my personal information?

If for any reason you are concerned with the way we are using your personal information, or would like to correct or request that we delete such personal information, please contact Smilegate West Privacy Policy, Attention: Privacy Administrator, PO Box 10061, Toronto, Ontario, CANADA M2N 0B6 . You can also contact us by e-mailing us at info@smilegatewest.com. We will respond to any request for access within 30 days.

In some cases, we may not be able to delete your personal information and will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

Please note that the deletion of your data will lead to the termination of your account and applicable services.

To manage the information SGW receives about you from an SNS where you play our games, you will need to follow the instructions at that site for updating your information and changing your privacy settings.

##### How secure is my personal information?

SGW implements security measures to protect the security of your personal information both online and offline. It is important that you protect and maintain the security of your account and that you immediately notify SGW of any unauthorized use of your account. If you forget your account password, you can request instructions to reset your password. When you sign into your account or enter payment information (such as a credit card number when purchasing virtual currency), we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology ("SSL").

While we take reasonable precautions against possible security breaches of our Services and our customer databases and records, our Services, or any website or Internet transmission is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. We urge you to take steps to keep your personal information safe (including your account password), and to log out of your account after use. If your SNS account is hacked, this may lead to unauthorized play of your SGW games.

It is important for you to know that the transmission of information over the Internet is not completely secure. Although SGW strives to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your data while it is being transmitted to us. Therefore, any transmission is at your own risk. 

##### California Residents: Your California Privacy Rights

Under California law, our customers that are California residents may request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We do not share our customer's personal information with unaffiliated third parties for direct marketing purposes without their approval.

If at any time you wish to opt out of having your personal information shared with third parties and/or receiving information from SGW (via e-mail or postal mail) about new products, services, or promotions, you can do so. You may contact us at Smilegate West, Inc, Attn: Privacy Administrator, PO Box 10061, Toronto, Ontario, CANADA M2N 0B6 . You can also contact us by e-mailing us at info@smilegatewest.com. 

##### Changes to Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically to ensure that you are aware of any changes. If we make a material change to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting the change on this website or in this Privacy Policy and, if necessary, give you additional choices regarding such change. Your continued use of SGW Services will signify your acceptance of these changes.
