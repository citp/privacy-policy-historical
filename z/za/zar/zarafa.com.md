# Zarafa Privacy Policy | www.zarafa.com

**Purpose and Scope**  
This policy discloses what information we gather when visiting zarafa.com or buy products directly from us. It describes how we use that information and how you can control it.

**Information Zarafa gathers and tracks**  
Zarafa collects two kinds of information from users:

  1. data which users volunteer by signing up to receive news and product information, entering contests, completing surveys, or buying directly from us;
  2. aggregated tracking data we collect when users interact with Zarafa.



**Personal information**  
We use the personal information you provide voluntarily to send information you've requested and to fulfill orders. The specific use of your personal information varies, depending on the way you contact us:

  * When you subscribe to Zarafa mailing lists to receive Zarafa news and product information, you must provide email address. We never sell or rent your email address you provide when subscribing to our lists. Please note that Zarafa mailing lists are archived by several third party sites and your email address can be found from their archives. Zarafa doesn't have control over those archives.
  * When you order Zarafa commercial licenses, or purchase commercial support, or buy training, we add you to our mailing lists and will contact you in Zarafa related issues now and then.
  * When you enter a contest or survey, we may ask for your name, address, and email address so we can administer the contest and notify winners.



We release personal information when we believe that release is appropriate to comply with the law, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Zarafa , our users, or others. This may include exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

In addition, Zarafa and its' partners may engage in joint events or resell each others' products. Such promotions will always reference the partners involved. Both Zarafa and the partner(s) will have access to that information.

We analyse visitors' use of our sites by tracking information such as pageviews, traffic flow, search terms, and click through. We use this information to improve our sites. We also share this anonymous traffic and demographic information in aggregate form with advertisers and other business partners. We do not share any information with advertisers that can identify an individual user.
