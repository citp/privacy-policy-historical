## Information collected by our order forms, download forms and surveys

Our site's order form requires users to give us contact information (their name, postal and e-mail address) and financial information (credit card number.) Contact information from the order form is used to send orders and information about our company to our customers. The customer's contact information is also used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services. None of the information collected on our order form is passed to third parties.

Our site's download form requires users to give us contact information (their name and e-mail address). Contact information from this form is used to send information about our products and company to our customers. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings at the time of downloading or subsequently; see the choice/opt-out section below. None of the information collected on our download form is passed to third parties.

Occasionally we run online surveys which may ask visitors for contact information (like their e-mail address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level) and questions about their use of our products and web site. The customer's contact information may be used to contact the visitor when necessary but is not used for mailings. This demographic, product and web site information is used to improve our products, customer service and web site. None of the information collected on our survey form is passed to third parties.
