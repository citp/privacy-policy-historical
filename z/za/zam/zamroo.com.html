We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Zamroo Service to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.</p>
					<p class="highlight">Acceptance of Terms</p>

					<p class="highlight">Summary</p>
					<p>Our primary goal in collecting user information is to enhance your experience on our website. In general Zamroo (“Site” or “we”, or “us”) does not collect, use or disclose any data collected with an intention to personally identify and/or contact a person such as: name, address, etc (personally identifying information, hereinafter “Personal Information”) except in specific instances, for example, when you provide Personal Information through registering on the Site or as set forth in this Privacy Policy. </p>

					<p>Like many other online marketplace, we also make use of log files. We automatically collect limited information about your computer's connection to the Internet, mobile number, mobile make and model, including your IP address, when you visit our site, application or service. Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data -- such as the pages you view. It also contains the additional information like type of browser, Internet Service Provider           (ISP), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, and number of clicks to analyze trends, track user’s movement around the site, and gather required demographic information. </p>
					<p class="highlight">Cookies</p>
					<p>To improve the responsiveness of our Website and Mobile Application, we may use "cookies", or similar electronic tools to collect information to assign each visitor a unique, random number as a User Identification (User ID) to understand the user's individual interests using the identified computer. Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for example), we will have no way of knowing who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply. A cookie cannot read data off your hard drive.
