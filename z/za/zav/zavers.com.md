# Zavers • Privacy Policy

Zavers℠ takes your privacy seriously. We have created this privacy policy in order to tell you how we collect information, what we do with it, and what controls you have. Please read it carefully, and if you have any questions or concerns, please [send us a comment](https://web.archive.org/contact_us).

This privacy policy applies to personal information collected via this website, and not to any other activities of Zavers or its affiliates or business partners. Personal information means information about you that is personally identifiable – including your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, purchases, or other information we may request and collect from you, including your household composition, family member ages, and/or purchasing/product preferences – and that is not otherwise publicly available. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Zavers does not own or control, or to people that Zavers does not employ or manage.

## Information Collection and Use

When visiting any Web site, browsers generally send information to the site's hosting server identifying the browser you are using, your Internet Service Provider, the page you last visited, and the page you are currently visiting. We log this information and we may also track and catalog the search terms that you enter in our search forms. When you register for Zavers, we ask you for personal information, including your name, address, e-mail address, and retail store preferred shopper ID numbers. We may also receive information from you other ways, such as customer feedback you provide or customer service help you request, and other ways.

We use information we collect to administer and improve Zavers, process and follow up requests, and to improve the availability of offers of interest to you.

## Cookies

We make use of a standard feature of browser software called a "cookie" that helps us recognize you when you visit. Cookies allow us to recognize you when you pay a repeat visit to Zavers. Cookies let us personalize your shopping experience based on your preferences and help Zavers to work better.

Most browsers accept cookies. If you wish, however, you can usually set your browser to refuse cookies. If you set your browser to refuse cookies, you may not be able to access all of our services.

## About Children

We do not collect any personally identifiable information from anyone whom we know to be under the age of 13. We ask that children under age 13 do not submit information to us.

## Security

We use industry-standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption technology, a secure server, and other physical and procedural safeguards to protect the security of your personal information. No security system, however, is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. Please keep your password private. We will never ask for it by phone or e-mail, and neither should anyone else.

## Disclosure of Personal Information

Zavers does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to develop and provide products or services, when we have your permission, as provided in the Terms & Conditions, or under the following circumstances:

  * We provide the information to our trusted partners, including product manufacturers, retailers, coupon providers, and others who work on behalf of or with Zavers. These trusted partners may use your personal information to help Zavers provide you service, or communicate with you about offers from Zavers and our marketing partners.
  * We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, to comply with the law, establish or exercise our legal rights, or defend against legal claims.
  * We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of the Zavers terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.
  * We transfer information about you if we sell or buy assets, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, personal information is generally one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing privacy policy (unless, of course, you otherwise consent). Also, in the unlikely event that Zavers, or some or all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
