for our users, we use "cookies", or such similar electronic tools
to collect information to assign each visitor a unique random
number as a User Identification (User ID) to understand the
user's individual interests using the Identified Computer. Unless
the User voluntarily identifies himself/herself (e.g. through
registration), Zapak has no way of knowing who the User is, even
if we assign a cookie to the User's computer. The only personal
information a cookie can contain is information supplied by the
User. A cookie cannot read data off the User's hard drive. Our
advertisers may also assign their own cookies to the User's
browser (if the User clicks on their ad banners), a process that
Zapak does not control.<br><br>Zapak's web servers automatically collect limited information
about User's computer's connection to the Internet, including
User's IP address, when the User visits our site. (User's IP
address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet
know where to send data to the User -- such as the web pages
viewed by the User). The User's IP address does not identify the
User personally. Zapak uses this information to deliver its web
pages to Users upon request, to tailor it's site to the interests
of it's users, to measure traffic within it's site and let
advertisers know the geographic locations from where Zapak's
visitors come.<br><br>Zapak also includes links to other websites. Such websites are
governed by their respective privacy policies, which are beyond
Zapak's control. Once the User leaves Zapak's servers (the User
can tell where he/she is by checking the URL in the location bar
on the User's browser), use of any information provided by the
User is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the
site which the User is visiting. That policy may differ from
Zapak's own. If the User can't find the privacy policy of any of
these sites via a link from the site's homepage, the User may
contact the site directly for more information.<br><br>When Zapak presents information to it's online advertisers -- to
help them understand our audience and confirm the value of
advertising on our website -- it is usually in the form of
aggregated statistics on traffic to various pages within our
site. When you register with Zapak, we contact you from time to
time about updation your content to provide features which we
believe may benefit you.<br><br>All information gathered on Zapak is securely stored within
Zapak-controlled database. The database is stored on servers
secured behind a firewall; access to such servers being
password-protected and strictly limited based on need-to-know
basis. However, we understand that as effective as our security
measures are, no security system is impenetrable. Thus, we cannot
guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that
information you supply will not be intercepted while being
transmitted to us over the Internet. Further, any information you
include in a posting to the discussion areas will be available to
anyone with Internet access.<br><br>Zapak also believes that the internet is an ever-evolving medium.
We may periodically review from time to time and change our
privacy policy to incorporate such future changes as may be
considered appropriate. Our use of any information we gather will
always be consistent with the policy under which the information
was collected, regardless of what the new policy may be.<br><br>We use third-party advertisers to serve ads when you visit our
