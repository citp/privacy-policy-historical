## 1. This Policy and Your Use of this Website.

Your use of this Website is governed by the Terms & Conditions, which are a contract between you and Zaxby's regarding your use of this Website. If you have not already reviewed the Terms & Conditions, please review them now prior to continuing to use this Website.

## 2. Information We Collect.

We may use our Website to collect a variety of information, including, but not limited to:

## 3. How We Collect Information.

We typically collect information from our Website visitors in one of three ways. First, we may collect information that our Website visitors voluntarily provide to us when registering for one of our programs, placing an online order, contacting us with questions or comments regarding our products, or submitting a franchise application. Second, we may collect information passively from our visitors using common online tracking tools such as web beacons, "cookies", and location-based data services. Finally, we may obtain information from one of our franchised locations and combine that information with other information we already have concerning our customers.

## 4. How We Use Information.

Zaxby's may use information collected from you on this Website in a variety of ways. Generally, we use such information to respond to our customers, improve our products and customer service, and strengthen the security of this Website. More specifically, we may use information we collect from you on this Website to:

A) Send you marketing communications about Zaxby's and our products;

B) Notify you about upcoming promotions on this Website or in our restaurants;

C) Review and improve our Website;

D) Fulfill online orders;

E) Respond to your inquiries;

F) Conduct marketing research;

G) Protect and improve the security of this Website;

H) Evaluate and respond to franchise applications; and

I) Take any other actions and implement any other policies intended to improve our restaurants, customer service, and customer experience.

J) Provide you with localized search results

## 5. Disclosure of Information.

Zaxby's may disclose information collected from you on this Website to our subsidiaries, affiliates, employees, and franchisees (collectively, the "Zaxby's Family"). These disclosures typically will allow a member of the Zaxby's Family to improve our restaurants and provide better service to our customers by performing one of the functions listed above in Section 4 of this Policy.

Zaxby's does not sell your personal information to third parties. From time to time, however, Zaxby's may disclose information collected from you on this Website to third-party service providers retained by Zaxby's to assist in its customer service, marketing, and franchising efforts. When Zaxby's discloses your information to a third-party service provider, Zaxby's only discloses the information necessary for the third party to perform their specific service(s). Zaxby's also requires such third party to protect your information and does not allow such third-party to use your information for any other purpose.

Except as set otherwise forth in this Policy, Zaxby's does not sell, transfer or disclose personal information to third parties outside of the Zaxby's Family unless we are required to transfer or disclose such personal information in cooperation with an ongoing law enforcement investigation, in response to the judicial process, to comply with other legal requirements, or to assist on any matter relating to public safety or health.

## 6. Information Collected During Franchise Application Process.

Zaxby's follows a thorough, multi-step franchise application process prior to authorizing a franchised location and may collect sensitive personal information through this Website or through other electronic means during the franchise application process. Zaxby's also may disclose the personal information of applicants to third-party service providers retained by Zaxby's to assist in the franchise application process. However, Zaxby's will only provide such third party with the information necessary to assist Zaxby's, will require such third party to protect your information, and will not allow such third-party to use your information for any other purpose.

This website also may direct applicants to a third-party website where applicants can obtain additional information or forms to submit to Zaxby's during the franchise application process. Applicants should be aware that this Policy does not apply to any third party websites, and applicants may or may not receive notice that they are leaving this Website for a third-party website. As a result, Zaxby's encourages applicants to refer to the privacy policies of any third-party websites used by Zaxby's during the franchise application process to learn more about the privacy policies and practices of such websites.

## 7. Children's Online Privacy Policy.

Zaxby's does not knowingly request, solicit, collect, or otherwise obtain personal information online from anyone under the age of 13 on this Website. If we receive actual knowledge that we have collected or received personal information online from anyone under the age of 13, we will delete that information from our records as soon as reasonably practicable. If you are a parent or guardian and are aware that your child has provided Zaxby's with personal information online, we encourage you to [contact us](https://web.archive.org/privacy-policy/#Contact%20Us.) at your convenience so that we can delete your child's personal information from our records as soon as reasonably practicable.

Although Zaxby's does not knowingly collect personal information online from anyone under the age of 13, parents should be aware that the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") would in most cases require Zaxby's to obtain verifiable parental consent to collect personal information online from a person under the age of 13. COPPA also allows parents to: (a) choose whether their child's personal information will be disclosed to any third parties prior to any such disclosure; (b) access their child's personal information upon request; (c) remove or delete the child's personal information; and (d) opt-out of future collection or use of the child's personal information. Finally, COPPA prohibits Zaxby's and other website operators from conditioning a child's participation in a contest, game or other activity upon the child disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in that contest, game or other activity.

If you would like more information about COPPA, please visit the [FTC](http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/coppafaqs.shtm "FTC") for additional information.

## 8. Information Security.

At Zaxby's, we use what we believe are industry-standard security practices to protect your personal information. Despite our efforts, however, we are unable to guarantee that any personal information we collect from you will remain completely secure. No technology is foolproof, and information storage systems occasionally can be breached and accessed by third parties in violation of law. Therefore, we encourage you to use caution when using the internet or any mobile device and to take reasonable steps to protect the confidentiality of your passwords, account information, and payment information.

## 9. Third-Party Websites.

This Policy applies only to personal information collected on this Website. This Website may contain links to third-party websites that are not owned or operated by Zaxby's, and you may or may not receive notice that you are leaving this Website. Zaxby's is not responsible for the policies, content and practices of such third-party websites, and you visit such third-party websites at your own risk. As a result, we encourage you to refer to the privacy policies of those websites to learn more about the policies and practices of such websites.

## 10. Updates to this Policy.

By visiting and using our Website, you are agreeing to the practices described in this Policy. From time to time, we may need to revise this Policy to reflect changes in our practices and policies concerning your privacy. When we update this Policy, we will post the changes immediately. Thereafter, your continued use of this Website constitutes acceptance of our revised Policy.

Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions regarding this Policy, including, but not limited to, our [Children's Online Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/privacy-policy/#Children's%20Online%20Privacy%20Policy.), or any other matter regarding this Website.
