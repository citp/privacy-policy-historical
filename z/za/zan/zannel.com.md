This Privacy Policy describes how we treat personally identifiable information of the users of our Site and the web plug-in, desktop, wap, mobile application and other services (collectively, the “Services”) provided by Zannel via this Site or otherwise.

#### Privacy Policy Updates

Due to the Internet’s rapidly evolving nature, Zannel may need to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If so, Zannel will post its updated Privacy Policy on our Site located at [http://www.Zannel.com](http://www.zannel.com/) so you are always aware of what personally identifiable information we may collect and how we may use or disclose this information. Zannel encourages you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Your continued use of this Site or our Service and/or continued provision of personally identifiable information to us will be subject to the terms of the then-current Privacy Policy.

#### Information Collection and Use

You can generally visit our Site without revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself. However, in certain sections of this Site, we may require you to register to use our Services, contact us with questions or comments or request information, participate in contests, surveys or questionnaires. Due to the nature of some of these activities, we may collect personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, phone number, password, username, gender, age, employment, income level, credit card information, phone carrier, phone model, mobile browser type, device firmware version and any other information that you voluntarily transmit during your communications to us. Additionally, we may collect personally identifiable information about you that you voluntarily include or post in any content that you submit to the Site and/or through the use of the Services and other users will be able to see any information that you include in your content and such publicly available forums. Thus, you should be aware that whenever you voluntarily post public information, that that information can be accessed by the public and can in turn be used by those people to contact you or to communicate with you. Therefore, we encourage you think about what personally identifiable information you include in your postings and/or submissions to this Site. We may use your personally identifiable information to deliver certain Services, products or information you have requested, send you notices for products and/or Services that you have used or that may be of interest to you and other marketing materials, and improve the content and general administration of the Site and our Services.

To the extent you have opted in to this feature, other users may be able to run searches that reveal information about you and the content you have viewed (based on the search criteria entered by the other users like age, gender, types of content and so forth) and such users may instant message you using our Services.

We may provide your personally identifiable information that we collect and the data generated by cookies to our parent, subsidiary or affiliate entities within our corporate family, third party partner entities and the vendors and service agencies that we may engage to assist us. For example, we may provide your personally identifiable information to an organization in order to complete a service (e.g., process your payment). Such third party entities will be restricted from further distributing your personally identifiable information and they will not be permitted to further distribute your personally identifiable information. However, certain third party entities with whom we have a business relationship may use your personally identifiable information to send you marketing or promotional materials. We will not sell your personally identifiable information to any company or organization except we may transfer your personally identifiable information to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization in which Zannel participates or to a purchaser of all or substantially all of Zannel’s assets to which this Site relates.
