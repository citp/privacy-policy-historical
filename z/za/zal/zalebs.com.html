<p id="what"><strong>What We Do With Your Information </strong></p>

<p>We use your personal information for purposes of improving our website, developing and customising products and services better suited to your needs.</p>

<p>If you expressly consent to us using your personal information for marketing purposes, we may also use it to send you relevant marketing, promotional and advertising material, newsletters and other communications offering you products and information about products and services (including by means of direct marketing) offered by us, our affiliates and other third party providers from time to time, which products and services we think may be of interest to you.</p>

<p>Information you submit when you register on our website will not be used for purposes of direct marketing, sending you information, updates on special inserts and competitions, unless you fill out the relevant registration form.</p>

<p>We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers.

<p>To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections, which may include the use of passwords. You must carefully safeguard any password provided to and/or used by you in relation to such access, and immediately notify us should there be any unauthorised use of such password.</p>

<p id="commenting"><strong>Commenting And Other Non-Personal Information </strong></p>

<p>We may put in place facilities that enable you to comment or provide other non-personal information on the website. Once your comments are online, everyone will have access to it. In this regard, you are advised to exercise caution when making comments.</p>

<p id="amendments"><strong>Amendments To This Privacy Policy </strong></p>

<p>We may amend this policy from time to time to have regard for changes in the law and in accordance with our requirements. We will post any updates and amendments on our website. It is important that you review this policy regularly so that you are aware of any amendments.</p>
