<p id="what">
	<strong>What We Do With Your Information </strong></p>
<p>
	We use your personal information for purposes of improving our website, developing and customising products and services better suited to your needs.</p>
<p>
	If you expressly consent to us using your personal information for marketing purposes, we may also use it to send you relevant marketing, promotional and advertising material, newsletters and other communications offering you products and information about products and services (including by means of direct marketing) offered by us, our affiliates and other third party providers from time to time, which products and services we think may be of interest to you.</p>

	&nbsp;</p>
<p id="whom">
	<strong>With Whom Is Your Information Shared? </strong></p>
<p>
	We will not, unless it’s with your consent, share any of your personal information with any third party (save to the extent strictly necessary to give effect to the purposes set out in this privacy policy).</p>
<p>
	Information you submit when you register on our website will not be used for purposes of direct marketing, sending you information, updates on special inserts and competitions, unless you fill out the relevant registration form.</p>

<p>
	We also use the information we collect to compile statistical data, and to compile profiles for statistical purposes about website users.

<p>
	You have a right to request us to confirm whether or not we hold personal information about you, and to request that we describe any such information to you, and you have a right to request that the information be corrected or deleted.</p>
<p>
	To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections, which may include the use of passwords. You must carefully safeguard any password provided to and/or used by you in relation to such access, and immediately notify us should there be any unauthorised use of such password.</p>
