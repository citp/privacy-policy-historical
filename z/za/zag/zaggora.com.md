ZAGGORA LTD, trading through WWW.ZAGGORA.COM ("ZAGGORA" "we", "our", "us") and its subsidiary companies respect the privacy rights of its online visitors ("you", "your", "yours") and recognise the importance of protecting the information collected about them. We have adopted a corporate wide Privacy Policy that guides how we collect, store and use the information that you provide us with. As part of our commitment to your privacy rights and security, our website has been certified by Geotrust.

If you are under 16, we require that you inform a parent or guardian about ZAGGORA's Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions as well as requiring their consent to the Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions before registering or placing an order with ZAGGORA. 

The following information is provided by ZAGGORA to enable our online visitors to be fully informed of our Privacy Policies. By visiting ZAGGORA.COM, you are accepting and consenting to the practices described in this Privacy Policy and the Terms and Conditions.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to websites maintained by other companies or organizations to which we link and ZAGGORA is not responsible for any personal information you submit to third parties via our website. Please ensure that you read the Privacy Policy of such other companies or organizations before submitting your details.

**WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT FROM YOU AND HOW?**

ZAGGORA collects personal information ("Personal Information") in several ways when you place an order, buy a gift voucher for a friend or register for a service offered by ZAGGORA. By registering, you are consenting to the collection of your personal data. If an order is placed with us, we need to hold personal information including your name, email address, phone numbers, home address, shipping and billing address(es) so that we can process and fulfill your order.

Credit/ debit card details will be saved and processed by SagePay or ChasePaymentech, global online transactions providers, or Paypal. ZAGGORA does not receive your credit card number. Saved card details will never be shared with third parties and will only be used to process your order, using our payment partner's systems. Additionally we may also obtain information as a result of authentication or identity checks. Sometimes we may ask for your telephone number. This number may be given to our courier for delivery services. These details allow us to process your order and to let you know the status of your order.

**HOW THIS INFORMATION MAY BE USED, INCLUDING ANYONE IT MIGHT BE SHARED WITH**

ZAGGORA may use your Personal Information for the processing of orders, payments and to provide you with a personalized shopping experience. We will also use your details to fulfill and deliver your orders and manage your account. Personal Information that you provide may be disclosed to a credit reference or fraud prevention agency, which may keep a record of that information. Your personal information may also be shared with other trading divisions within the ZAGGORA group. Where there is a legal obligation to do so, we may disclose your information to any relevant regulatory body. We may provide access to Personal Information when legally required to do so to cooperate with police investigations or other legal proceedings, to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Website, to limit our legal liability and protect our rights or to protect the rights, property, or safety of visitors of this Website or the public.

We may also use your Personal Information to send you marketing updates but only ever in accordance with your preferences (as detailed in the next section). ZAGGORA may disclose your personal information to third parties whom ZAGGORA instructs to provide services on ZAGGORA’s behalf, including, but not limited to, support services, website services, delivering promotional materials, contests, sweepstakes and other promotions, and answering customer questions about ZAGGORA’s products and services. We do not sell your details to third party marketing companies, unless authorized by you at purchase point. 

We do collate statistical information about site traffic, sales and other commercial information which we may pass on to trusted third parties but these statistics do not include any information which can identify you personally. We see this as a value-added service helping you to find useful products or services.

Finally, we may use your Personal Information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, together with non-personal data to monitor customer patterns so we can consistently improve our site design to better meet our visitors' needs.

From time to time ZAGGORA may employ third party business partners to collect Personal Information on ZAGGORA's behalf. In such cases, these third parties will be subject to confidentiality agreements and instructed by ZAGGORA to comply fully with the ZAGGORA Privacy Policy.

**SAFEGUARDING YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION**
