<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
ekoVenture, Inc. ("Company") doing business as (DBA) ZOZI, knows that you care about how your personal information
is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy
policy. By visiting the www.zozi.com website and domain name, or otherwise accessing any other linked pages,
features, content, or services offered from time to time by Company in connection therewith (collectively, the "Website"),
you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<h2>What does this privacy policy cover?</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy covers Company's treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that
Company gathers when you access the Website and when you use Company's services. This policy does not apply to the
practices of companies that Company does not own or control, or to individuals that Company does not employ or manage.
</p>
<h2>What personal information does company collect?</h2>
<p>
The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and improve our services. We collect the following
types of information from our customers:
</p>
<h4>PERSONAL INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO US:</h4>
<p>
We may receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide to us in any other way. The types of
Personal Information collected include your full name, credit card information, email address, zip code,
IP address, browser information, username, password, historical purchase data and any other information necessary
for us to provide our services. The Personal Information you provide may be used for such purposes as responding
to your requests for certain services, customizing the content you see, and communicating with you about new services.
</p>
<h4>FINANCIAL INFORMATION:</h4>
<p>
We may have access to certain financial information you provide to us through the Website, such as your payment method
(valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information); that information is collected and
stored by our third party payment processing company (the “Payment Processor”), which may in turn provide us with a
secured portion of your financial information in order to complete transactions made through the Website.
You acknowledge that the use and storage of your financial information is governed by the Payment Processor’s applicable
terms of service and privacy policy.
</p>
<h4>PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED AUTOMATICALLY:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Website or use our services. Company
automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, which may include your IP address,
cookie information, web browser, device type, the dates and times you viewed pages, and the page you requested.
</li>
<li>
Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our
Website and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show.
Company only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would
identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the
Website or services so that we can make the Website appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve those
services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers,
collectively, use our Website or services. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand
how often people use the Website or services, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience.
Company may also use this usage information to deliver customized third party advertisements and information and to
track your entries, submissions, and the status of any promotions or other activities. Again, Company never
discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.
</li>
<li>
We may also obtain information, including Personal Information, from third parties and sources other than the
Website, such as advertisers, or other users who import your email address to their address book. We may also,
at your discretion, receive information from third party services that provide a mechanism to expose information
you have provided to such third party through use of an application program interface (API), such as Facebook
Connect. If we combine or associate information from other sources with Personal Information that we collect
through the Website, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information in accordance with this
Privacy Policy.
</li>
</ul>
<h4>E-MAIL COMMUNICATIONS:</h4>
<p>
We may use your email address to contact you for administrative purposes, customer services purposes, promotional
purposes, to address intellectual property infringement, rights of privacy, or defamation issues. We often receive
a confirmation when you open an email from Company if your computer supports this type of program. Company uses
this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful. When you receive e-mail from Company, you
can opt out of receiving further e-mails by following the included instructions to unsubscribe.
</p>
<h4>WHAT ABOUT COOKIES?</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your browser to enable
our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people.
We use cookies to enhance visitors' experiences, to learn more about their use of the Website and to improve the
quality of our services.
</li>
<li>
Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new
cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance
of each new cookie in a variety of ways.  We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because
cookies enable you to take advantage of some of our Website's most attractive features.
</li>
<li>
Ads appearing on the Website may be delivered to users by our advertising partners, who may set cookies. These
cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile
information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things,
deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use
of cookies by Company and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Will company share any of the personal information it receives?</h2>
<p>
Personal Information about our customers is an integral part of our business.  We neither rent nor sell your Personal
Information to anyone.  We share your Personal Information only as described below.
</p>
<p>
Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control: We anticipate that we may become affiliated with a variety of businesses and
work closely with them. In certain situations, these businesses may sell items to you through the Website.
In other situations, Company may provide services jointly with affiliated businesses. You can easily recognize when
an affiliated business is associated with your transaction, and we will share your Personal Information that is
related to such transactions with that affiliated business. In other instances, a third party business may provide
website hosting and maintenance services for us, and we may share your Personal Information with them solely to the
extent it is necessary for these service providers to complete their contractual obligations with us.
</p>
<p>
Agents: We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with
them to provide products or services to you.    Unless we tell you differently, Company's agents do not have any right
to use Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our
sharing of Personal Information for the above purposes.
</p>
<p>
Financial Information: As stated above, we may have access to a secured portion of your financial information, which
is collected and stored by our Payment Processor. We may from time to time request and receive some of your financial
information from our Payment Processor for the purposes of completing transactions you have initiated through the Website.
</p>
<p>
Promotional Offers: We may send offers to you on behalf of other businesses.  However, when we do so, we do not give
the other business your name and address.  If you do not wish to receive these offers, please send an email with your
request to <a href="mailto:help@zozi.com">help@zozi.com</a>
</p>
<p>
Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets.  In these types of transactions, customer
information is typically one of the business assets that are transferred.  Moreover, if Company, or substantially all
of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Company goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, customer
information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such
transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Company may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in
this policy.
</p>
<p>
Protection of Company and Others: We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is
necessary to comply with the law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights,
property, or safety of Company, our employees, our users, or others.  This includes exchanging information with other
companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
</p>
<p>
Information You Choose to Share: Any Personal Information you voluntarily choose to include in a publicly accessible
area on the Website will be available to other users who access that content. This also applies to information you
choose to make available through features that connect to third party services, such as Twitter or Facebook. We may
also syndicate content exposed in public areas of the Website to third party services. Once you make your Personal
Information available in any of these ways, it may be collected and used by the recipients without restriction.
</p>
<p>
With Your Consent: Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with
third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.
