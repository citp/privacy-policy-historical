	<p>Zootout Advertising Pvt. Ltd. owns &amp; runs the website
	<a href="http://www.zootout.com">
	www.Zootout.com</a>, mostly called as Zootout. It assists people to find &amp;

	visiting Zootout &amp; registering for personal accounts. Zootout is not bounded 
	by any third party sites that may be linked to them, or any relationships 
	you may have with the businesses listed on Zootout. 
	 </p><p>
	This Privacy Policy 
	describes our policies on the collection, use, and disclosure of your 
	information in connection with your use of our websites, emails, and mobile 
	applications. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, a "user" is defined 
	as someone using Zootout. To fulfil the purpose of our site, we need to 
	display a limited amount of personal information, so that users are able to 
	evaluate the trustworthiness of a particular shared experience. By using 
	Zootout, you permit the collection and use of your personal information as 
	outlined below in our Privacy Policy. You should visit this page 
	periodically to review any changes to the Privacy Policy. The terms "we",

	By using Zootout or its applications 
	(collectively, "Properties"), you are consenting to this Privacy Policy. 
	 </p>
	<h2>Disclaimers</h2>
	<p>	Although we make efforts to comply with this Privacy Policy, 
	we do not guarantee, warrant, represent, or promise such compliance. &nbsp; </p><p>This 
	Privacy Policy only applies to Properties we own or operate (solely or in 
	conjunction with our partners). Any third-party websites linked from our 
	Properties (for example, by banner advertisements) are governed by the 
	privacy policies of the third parties that own and operate those websites. 
	We have no control over third-party websites and assume no responsibility 
	for their collection, use, disclosure, or protection of personal 
	information. &nbsp;  </p><p>This Privacy Policy is subject to change at any time without 
	prior notice to you. Please check back from time to time to review the 
	current version. Your continued use of the Properties will indicate your 
	acceptance of the new policy. &nbsp;  </p><p>The headings used throughout this Privacy 
	Policy are meant to be illustrative of the subjects discussed under each 
	heading and may not cover every topic identified in the heading. As a 
	result, please read the Privacy Policy in its entirety. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
	 </p>
	 <h2>Collection of Information</h2>
	<p>We may collect information from users of its Properties in 
	various ways, including soliciting registration for use of our Properties. 
	As part of such registrations, users may be required to submit personally 
	identifiable information such as names, birthdates, photographs, and email 
	addresses. The registration may require additional information, such as 
	mailing addresses and phone numbers. &nbsp;  </p><p>Registrants may elect to receive our 
	newsletters and third-party promotional materials.  </p><p>We may require 
	registration for participation in special contests or sweepstakes. Special 
	rules may apply to such contests or sweepstakes. &nbsp; We may also collect 
	information such as fictitious names, aliases, avatar identities, or any 
	other form of fictitious identity in the event such identifiers can be and 
	are created in connection with the Properties. &nbsp;  </p><p>From time to time, we may 
	request information in connection with surveys or votes of users of our 
	Properties. Surveys or votes may or may not require registration. 
	Participation in such activities is voluntary. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  </p>
	<h2>Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Processes </h2>
	<p>
	We may collect information from users of 
	our Properties by using and accessing "cookies," "web beacons," "clear 
	gifs," Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses, and other computer programs or 
	processes. These programs or processes, such as for analytics, may also be 
	used and accessed by third-party network advertisers or traffic measurement 
	services. &nbsp;  </p><p>Cookies are small data files that are transferred to your 
	computer by servers. Web beacons are small electronic images (usually 
	single-pixel "gif" files) that allow access to cookies. Clear gifs are 
	invisible electronic images. IP addresses are unique sets of numbers 
	assigned to computers that are accessing the Internet. &nbsp;  </p><p>We, or the third 
	parties, mentioned above, may use and access the computer devices in order 
	to improve content offerings by, for example, tracking usage patterns, 
	customizing content, and recording information submitted by users. However, 
	the data will be aggregate and will not include personally identifiable 
	information. &nbsp;  </p><p>If you wish, you may elect to configure your browser to 
	prevent websites from installing and accessing cookies on your computer. 
	Please note that blocking cookies will interfere with your use and enjoyment 
	of the Properties. </p>
	
	<h2>Use of Information  </h2>
	<p>We collect information from 
	registrants primarily to facilitate their participation in the Properties. 
	Specifically, usernames and passwords allow registrants to access the 
	Properties; and names and email addresses are helpful for communicating with 
	registrants. The other information helps us to tailor the content of our 
	Properties to user preferences and communicate information about other 
	products or services that might be of interest.  </p><p>We may use your personally 
	identifiable information in other ways in connection with our business; for 
	example, we may use the information to alert you to improvements to the 
	Properties and solicit your opinion about such improvements.  </p><p>We use 
	non-personally identifiable information in an aggregate, anonymous manner 
	primarily to (i) improve the design, functionality, and content of our 
	Properties; and (ii) provide products and services that might interest our 
	users.  
	</p>
	
	<h2>Use of Links </h2>
	<p>Zootout may contain links to third party websites to 
	which we have no affiliation. Except as set forth herein, we do not share 
	your personal information with those third parties, and are not responsible 
	for their privacy practices. We suggest you read the privacy policies on all 
	such third party websites.</p>  
	
	<h2>Personal data controlling </h2>
	<p>
	To the extent you 
	include personal information in your submissions (such as a photo of 
	yourself), third parties may be able to identify you, and associate you with 
	your user account, and contact you. Third parties can also associate you 
	with your user account using the member lookup feature on Zootout. Please do 
	not include information in your submissions that you expect to keep private. 
	In addition, you can reduce the risk of being personally identified by 
	choosing a fictitious account name, though doing so could detract from the 
	credibility of your submissions.  </p><p>As a registered Zootout user, you can 
	modify some of your personal information and your privacy preferences by 
	accessing the "Account" section of this website.  </p>
	
	<h2>Disclosure to Third Parties</h2>
	<p>We will usually not disclose any information about users of our 
	Properties to any third parties. However, we may make disclosures from time 
	to time in the following circumstances, without limitation: If you submit 
	content for publication (for example, by sending an email or posting to a 
	message board or chat room), then we may publish the content with any 
	personally identifiable information that accompanies the content.  </p>
	<ul><li>
				Your user 
	information may be displayed on the Properties to other users of the 
	Properties (for example, your self-selected user name).    
	</li>
		<li>
				If you voluntarily 
	elect to receive information from a third-party vendor, we will forward that 
	request to the vendor along with the personal information that you submit. 
	 </li>
		<li>
				We may disclose information in response to a court order or request of law 
	enforcement personnel, or in connection with litigation or other legal 
	proceedings.    
	</li>
		<li>
				We may disclose information in the normal course of business 
	with such third parties as (i) professional advisors; (ii) providers of 
	technology, order fulfilment, or customer service assistance; or (iii) 
	potential or existing affiliates, assignees, licensees, acquirers, or 
	successors of our company.   
	</li>
		<li>
		If we elect to disclose information to third 
	parties that market products or services, co-brand services, or sponsor 
	promotional events in connection with our users, users will have the option 
	to opt out of such disclosure. In the event that we do disclose any such 
	information to third parties, we typically require the third parties to 
	maintain the confidentiality of the disclosed information.   
	</li>
	</ul>
	<p>We maintain 
	physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and prevent 
	unauthorized access to private information in our possession. However, these 
	procedures may not protect your information during transmission to our 
	servers.</p>  
	
	<h2>Dispute Resolution  </h2>
	<p>If you face any trouble, or believe that Zootout has not adhered to any Privacy Policy, then you may write to Zootout 
	at info@zootout.com. In your email, please 
	describe in as much detail as possible ways in which you believe the Privacy 
	Policy has not been complied with. We will investigate your complaint 
	promptly.</p>
