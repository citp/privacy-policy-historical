	       <p><b>What This Privacy Policy Covers</b><br>
	       This policy covers how ZooLoo, along with its partners, (collectively, "ZooLoo," "we," "us," or "our") treats personal information that it collects and receives on ZooLoo.com. We are not in the business of selling information about you: we use information shared with us for the purpose of running and improving our services. This notice tells you what information we collect, steps we take to protect and secure it, how we use and share information, and finally, how you can contact us with questions or concerns.</p>
	       
	      
	         <ul><b>Information We Gather</b><br>
	           <li>ZooLoo collects personal information when you register with us, use ZooLoo products or services or post content on a ZooLoo web site. This information is typically limited to your email address, username, survey information and any information you post on your site. Your password is stored using a one way hash function.</li>
	           <li>ZooLoo may register a domain name and maintain ownership and control of it on your behalf. Any transfer of a domain name is subject to ZooLoo Terms of Service.</li>
	           <li>ZooLoo may also collect personal information if you enter into promotions or sweepstakes.</li>
	           <li>ZooLoo may automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookies, and the pages you request.</li>
	           <li>ZooLoo uses information for the following general purposes: products and services provision, identification and authentication, services improvement, support, contact, research, and anonymous reporting.</li>
	        </ul>
	    
	       
	       
	        <ul style="bulleted"><b>Billing Information</b><br>
	           <li>Should you sign up for any ZooLoo Paid Services including Upgrades/Add-Ons or register a domain through us, we require your billing information in order to process the transaction.</li>
	           <li>Should you sign up for a ZooLoo Plus account or register a domain through us, we require your billing information in order to process the transaction.</li>
	           <li>We use the Secure PayPal Merchant Services to execute your transaction.</li>
	           <li>We store and process your personal information on our computers in the US, and we protect it by maintaining physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in compliance with applicable US federal and state regulations. We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we enforce physical access controls to our buildings and files, and we authorize access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities.</li>
	           <li>If your subscription is auto-renewing, a recurring subscription will be created at our payment gateway and we store your billing information in our secure payment gateway for as long as necessary to carry out the terms of your subscription.</li>
	           <li>Should you cancel your subscription, your billing information will be immediately removed by ZooLoo upon final reconciliation and settlement of your account.</li>
	           <li>All transactions are processed over an industry standard SSL/TLS connection, with a minimum of 128-bit encryption.</li>
	        </ul>
	       
	       
	       
	       
	         <ul style="bulleted"><b>IP Address</b><br>
	           <li>ZooLoo may occasionally obtain IP addresses from users depending upon how you access our web sites. IP addresses, browser and session information may be used for various purposes, including to:
	             <ul style="bulleted">
	               <li>Diagnose and prevent service or technology problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web company or ISP.</li>

	        <ul style="bulleted"><b>Cookies</b><br>
	           <li>A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive.</li>

	           <li>ZooLoo does not share personal information we learn about you from your use of the ZooLoo web sites, products and services with others except as described in this policy.</li>
	           <li>ZooLoo may use or share your personal information where it is necessary to complete a transaction, to operate or improve the ZooLoo products and services, to outsource certain services to a trusted partner, to do something that you have asked us to do, or to develop aggregate information.</li>
	           <li>From time to time, ZooLoo may sponsor a promotion, sweepstake or contest (collectively "promotion") on ZooLoo. You may be asked to provide personal information including name, email address or home address or to answer questions in order to participate. Unless otherwise indicated in the promotion's rules, this information will be used strictly for the purpose of notifying and arranging delivery of promotional items to the person selected.</li>

	           <li>When you post content on a ZooLoo web site you have the ability to post content which may include personally identifiable information about yourself.

	           <li>If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return or other unwanted and possibly harmful contact.</li>
	           <li>ZooLoo may share personally identifiable information about you under the following circumstances:
	             
	             <ul style="bulleted">
	               <li>We may share your personal information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, to establish or exercise our legal rights or, defend against legal claims and if in our judgment in such circumstances disclosure is required or appropriate.</li>

	               <li>As we continue to develop our business, we may also buy or sell all or part of our business. In such transactions, personally identifiable information you have shared with us is generally one of the business assets that will be transferred. The transferred personally identifiable information will remain subject to the promises made in this privacy policy or subsequent policies to which you have consented.</li>
	             </ul>

	        </ul>
	       
	       
	       
	       <p><b>Terms of Service</b><br>
	        Your use of ZooLoo and its related services, and any disputes arising from it, is subject to this Privacy Policy as well as the Terms of Service, the terms of which are incorporated into this Privacy Policy by reference.

		    <p><b>Confidentiality and Security</b><br>
