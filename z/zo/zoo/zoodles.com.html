      are to provide and improve our Site, services, features and content, 
      to administer your Account (as defined below) (together, the “<b><i>Service</i></b>”) 
      and to enable members to enjoy and easily navigate the Site. </font> <br>

        through the Site, as an Inquisitive Minds Parent (“<b><i>Inquisitive 
        Minds</i></b> <b><i>Parent</i></b>”), or when you choose to add information 
        to your profile we will ask you for personally identifiable information.  
        This refers to information about you that can be used to contact or 
        identify you (“<b><i>Personal Information</i></b>”).  Personal 
        Information includes, but is not limited to, your name, email address, 
        home address, payment information, phone number and certain information 
        related to your social networks.  We use your Personal Information 
        mainly to provide the Service and administer your inquiries.  As membership 
        accounts are held by Inquisitive Minds Parents (“<b><i>Accounts</i></b>” 
        or “<b><i>Account</i></b>”), and not their children, the only information 
        we retain about your child is that information which you choose to provide 
        within the context of your Account so that we may provide the Site and 
        the Services.  For example, this information may include, but is not 
        limited to, your child’s first name and month and year of birth. </font></li>

        with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your 
        street address) in a way that enables you to be identified.  <i>
        But </i>the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying 
        Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other Non-Identifying 
        Information (for example, your viewing preferences).  We may combine 
        your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate 
        it with information collected from other Inquisitive Minds Parents to 
        attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality 
        and value of the Service and to analyze and understand how our Site

      When you visit the Site, whether as an Inquisitive Minds Parent or a 
      non-registered member just browsing (any of these, a <b>“<i>User</i>”</b>), 
      our servers automatically record information that your browser sends 
      whenever you visit a website (<b><i>“Log Data”</i></b>).  This 
      Log Data may include information such as your computer’s Internet 
      Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting 
      before you came to our Site, pages of our Site that you visit, the time 
      spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site, access 
      times and dates, and other statistics.  We use this information 
      to monitor and analyze use of the Site and the Service and for the Site’s 
      technical administration, to increase our Site’s functionality and 
      user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors’ needs.  
      For example, some of this information is collected so that when you 
      visit the Site again, it will recognize you and serve information appropriate 
      to your interests.  We also use this information to verify that 
      visitors to the Site meet the criteria required to process their requests.  
      We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association 
      with other Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and 
      evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding 
      other Non-Identifying Information.  </font> <br></p>

      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Like many websites, we use “cookies” 
      to collect information.  A cookie is a small data file that we 
      transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes.  
      We use cookies for two purposes.  First, we utilize persistent 
      cookies to save your registration ID and login password for future logins 
      to the Site.  Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain 
      features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with the 
      Site and to monitor aggregate usage by Users and web traffic routing 
      on the Site.  Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted 
      from your computer when you log off from the Site and Service and then 
      close your browser.  Third party advertisers on the Site may also 
      place or read cookies on your browser.<b> </b>
       You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting 
      cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites 
      you visit.  If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not

      </p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Identity theft and the practice currently 
      known as “phishing” are of great concern to Inquisitive Minds.  
      Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is 
      a top priority.  We do not and will not, at any time, request your 
      credit card information, your Account ID, login password, or national 
      identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone 
      communication.  For more information about phishing, visit the 
      Federal Trade Commission’s website.</font> <br></p>

      register through the Site and submit your Personal Information to create 
      a profile page, other Inquisitive Minds Parents will see your “Screen 
      Name.”  You can choose what other Personal Information you provide 
      as part of your profile (“<b><i>Other Member Information</i></b>”).  
      Providing Other Member Information is voluntary and should correlate 
      with the degree of interaction you want to have with other Inquisitive 
      Minds Parents.  We recommend that you guard your anonymity and 
      sensitive information, and that of your children, and that you not use 
      your real name as your “Screen Name,” since that would allow others 
      to identify you.  </font> <br></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial"><i><u>Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying

      Non-Identifying Information and Log Data with third parties for industry 
      analysis, demographic profiling and to deliver targeted advertising 
      about other products and services. </font> <br></p>

      <p><font size="3" face="Arial"><i><u>Service Providers</u></i>.  
      We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our 
      Service, to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Site-related 
      services (<i>e.g.</i>, without limitation, maintenance services, database 
      management, web analytics and improvement of the Site’s features) 
      or to assist us in analyzing how our Site and Service are used.  
      These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to 
      perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose 
      or use it for any other purpose. We may also provide Personal Information 
      to our business partners or other trusted entities for the purpose of 
      providing you with information on goods or services we believe will 
      be of interest to you.  You can, at any time, opt out of receiving 
      such communications.</font> <br></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial"><i><u>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement</u></i>.  
      Inquisitive Minds cooperates with government and law enforcement officials 
      and private parties to enforce and comply with the law.  We will 
      disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement 
      officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe 
      necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including 
      but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of 
      Inquisitive Minds or a third party, to protect the safety of the public 
      or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, 
      or to pose a risk of being, an illegal, unethical or legally actionable 
      activity. </font> <br></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial"><i><u>Business Transfers</u></i>.  
      Inquisitive Minds may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all

      profile by accessing their Account management page.  If you completely 
      delete all such information, then your Account may become deactivated.  
      If you would like us to delete your record in our system, please contact 
      us and we will attempt to accommodate your request if we do not have 
      any legal obligation to retain the record.  See below for privacy

      with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures 
      necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable 
      integrity of the data system. </font> <br></p>

      located outside the United States and choose to provide information 
      to us, Inquisitive Minds transfers Personal Information to the United 
      States and processes it there.  Your consent to this Privacy Policy
