ZoomCar™ respects your privacy. Our website is a secure shopping environment. We are committed to providing you with a safe online experience, as well as high quality products and services. 

**General**

ZoomCar™ does not sell or rent any of your personally identifiable information to any third party. However, due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. For example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances. In addition, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. We will, and you authorize us to, disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us to liability. We use industry standard practices to protect your privacy. We do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable information or private communications will remain private. 

**What information does ZoomCar™ collect and how is it used?**

When you visit ZoomCar™, we collect basic information that does not identify you. This includes which pages are visited, types of quotes and purchases, and feedback from our visitors. We collect this information to improve our website and your user experience. It may be disclosed to our service providers and affiliates to improve the products and services that are offered at ZoomCar.™

The information collected when you purchase or place a deposit on a vehicle is used to fulfill the order and charge your credit card. Personally identifying and credit card information is captured by our merchant account provider (MAP). ZoomCar™ does not have access to this information. We may, on occasion, use your name, address, email address and other information to notify you of exciting news and new products available at ZoomCar.™ You can remove your name from our marketing list if you prefer not to receive these communications. 

**With whom do we share information?**

Our MAP and service providers are the only companies that will obtain your personally identifying information, if you have elected to supply it to complete a transaction. In order for us to activate your vehicle service contract (warranty), Phoenix American Warranty Company, Inc. will be provided enough information to issue the warranty. Because we do not control the privacy practices of these third parties, you should evaluate their practices before deciding to use their services. These companies have agreed to treat information they receive from ZoomCar™ as protectively as they treat information they obtain from their users. We require our service providers to follow privacy practices no less protective than our own practices, as described in this document. We welcome any comments and questions. 

**Where does ZoomCar™ do business?**  
Zoomcar™ is currently licensed to do business in the state of New York. We are providing free delivery of vehicles to people who live within 100 miles of Melville, Long Island. We will soon be doing business in Cleveland, Ohio and Phoenix, Arizona. We expect to expand the markets in which we do business in the near future.
