Dear customers,

For transferring data zooplus uses the so-called SSL security system (secure socket layer) together with a 128-bit encryption. This technology offers the best possible security and is also used by all major high street banks, to protect all online banking data. You will know if a site uses encrypted data transmission by the closed padlock symbol on the bottom status bar of your browser.

Payment by credit card is completely safe due to our above-mentioned security standards.
