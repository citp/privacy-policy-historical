Dear Customer, 

We value your trust and thus make every effort to make your shopping experience safe and enjoyable. zooplus employs highest security standards at all times to ensure the protection of all your personal data from unauthorised access or use. Your order, personal data as well as your credit card details are protected by technical encryption and an additional authorisation process - both when transferring data and saving data on our servers. 

**Collecting and using your data**  
We collect information about you for two reasons: to process your order and to provide you with the best possible service. 

The personal data you submit at zooplus will not be passed on to any unauthorised third party outside the company. However, we may share your information with our certified partners when it is necessary to do so in order to fulfill your order. 

In order for the delivery company to provide a time frame for delivery of your parcel, we need to pass on personal details such as your address, email address and, where available, contact phone number to the delivery company. You will receive an email or a text message from the delivery company with further details of your delivery, and the option to change delivery options where possible. 

While registering with zooplus you also can subscribe to one of our marketing newsletters. If you wish to terminate the subscription, please tell us. You can do so at any time and at your convenience. 

**State-of-the-art technical standards**  
For transferring data zooplus uses the so-called SSL security system (secure socket layer) together with a 128-bit encryption. This technology offers the best possible security and is also used by all major high street banks, to protect all online banking data. You will know if a site uses encrypted data transmission by the closed padlock symbol on the bottom status bar of your browser. 

**Security of payment transactions**  
Payment by credit card is completely safe due to our above-mentioned security standards. 

**Your password**  
zooplus offers a special service in case you should forget your password: At the centre of the sign in-page you will always find the link "Forgotten your password?". We will send your password to your email address immediately. 

As only you or persons authorised by you have access to your email account, your password is safeguarded against unauthorised access. Please note: you should not entrust a third party with your log-in information and use the SSL encryption when ordering whenever it is available.
