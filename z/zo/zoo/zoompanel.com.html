	<p>This privacy policy  explains how SurveyMonkey collects, uses, transfers or otherwise handles  personally identifiable information from you, a visitor to the Zoomerang,  ZoomPanel and TrueSample websites operated by SurveyMonkey (collectively, the “<strong>Site</strong>”).
</p>
<h3>Scope</h3>
<p>This privacy policy only covers data collected through the Site. This privacy  policy does not cover any other data collection or processing practices,  including, without limitation, the practices of other web pages to which we  link or of users of our services provided through the Site (e.g., users of our  Zoomerang service). When we refer to this privacy policy in notices and consent  requests related to surveys, special-purpose web pages or otherwise, this privacy  policy applies as modified in the particular notice or consent request (e.g.,  with respect to types of data collected or purposes of collection).</p>
<p>
  SurveyMonkey.com, LLC  complies with the <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/" target="_blank">US-EU an US-Swiss Safe Harbor  Frameworks</a> developed by the U.S.  Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal  information from EU member countries and Switzerland.&nbsp; We have certified, and TRUSTe has verified,  that we adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward  transfer, security, data integrity, access and enforcement.&nbsp; View our certification on the U.S. Department  of Commerce’s <a href="http://safeharbor.export.gov/list.aspx" target="_blank">Safe Harbor website</a>.</p>
<h3>Types of Data and  Collection Methods</h3>
<p>Through the Site, we collect data that you actively submit (“<strong>Actively Submitted Data</strong>”) as well as  data that we collect about you from other sources (“<strong>Passively Tracked Data</strong>”):
</p>
<p><em>Actively Submitted  Data:</em> When you request  information, subscribe to a mailing list or for a service, register as a user,  post to one of our forums or communities, send or respond to an online survey  or otherwise actively send us data, we usually collect data such as your name,  email address(es), telephone number(s), country of residency, and certain  information related to the business you represent (if any). In connection with  chargeable services, we will also collect payment information (e.g., credit  card number and related verification information). In connection with our own  surveys, directed at ZoomPanel members, we ask questions related to the topic  of the survey. When you use our tools to send out your own surveys, you decide  who to contact and what questions to ask. In each such instance, however, you  will know what data we collect through the Site, because you have asked your  survey respondents to actively submit it.
</p>
<p><em>Passively Tracked  Data: </em>When  you visit the Site, we also passively track information on your computer and  Internet connection, such as the IP address of your computer and/or Internet  service provider, the date and time you access the Site, the Internet address  of web sites from which you link to or arrive at the Site, the computer  technology you are using and your movements and preferences on our Site. We use  technology that many other web sites employ, including, without limitation,  "cookies" or small data files stored on your computer's hard drive,  to collect information such as the aforementioned. In some instances, we also  use cookies to collect information in connection with future visits from that  web site, to recognize you as a previous visitor and to track your activity at  our Site. You do not need to have cookies turned on to participate in our  surveys or to visit our Site. You can refuse cookies by turning them off on  your browser, but please note that this may adversely affect your user  experience and convenience.</p>
<p><em>Combinations:</em> Unless you also  actively submit personal information such as your name or address in connection  with Passively Tracked Data, Passively Tracked Data does not typically allow us  to identify you personally.&nbsp; (Even though  it theoretically could be done, we do not try to find out who you are, unless we  need to comply with a legal obligation.) &nbsp;To the extent permitted by applicable law, we  reserve the right to combine Passively Tracked Data or data available via a  third party with personal data that you choose to actively submit. We do this  for some survey "panels" (which may be deployed on Zoomerang.com or  other sites). Specifically if you take surveys from us we will  "fingerprint" your system in order to combat fraud. In generating  this "fingerprint" we gather only publically available information  from your browser; this includes your IP address, browser version, and other similar  types of information.</p>
<h3>Collection Purposes,  Use of Data</h3>
<p><em>Passively Tracked Data: </em>We collect Passively  Tracked Data primarily for purposes of administering, protecting and improving  our Site and our systems, to better understand the preferences of our Site  visitors, to compile aggregated statistics about Site usage, and to help  personalize your experience on our Site. We also use cookies and Passively Tracked  Data to protect the integrity of surveys, e.g., to prevent survey respondents  from responding to the same survey twice.</p>
<p>
  For some survey panels  we will verify the information that you, or a third party, provide us and/or  combine the information you provide with information we may gather from  additional sources. Verification of personal data may be done on our systems,  or done by a third party. If your personal data is provided to us for  verification purposes only we will never store any of your personal information  on our systems (we store only the results of the verification process).</p>
<p><em>Actively Submitted Data:</em> We collect Actively Submitted Data primarily for two purposes:  Firstly, for the purpose for which you originally sent us the data e.g., to  receive the service you requested, to confirm your registration for a service,  to run a survey, to allow you to run a survey, to bill you for services or to  send you information or materials that you requested. Secondly, for the purposes  of informing you about our products and services; additionally, you can opt out  of receiving marketing emails as explained below.</p>
<h3>Disclosures of  Personal Information</h3>
<p>We are not in the business of selling or renting your information to  telemarketers and do not share your personally identifiable information with  others, except as follows:</p>
<ul class="greenUl">
<li class="greenLi">We may share your information with affiliated companies for  reward redemption and/or other market research opportunities.</li>
<li class="greenLi">If you use any of our services with a corporate email account  (i.e., an account for employees, contractors, etc. as opposed to a personal  email account with a general email service provider such as AOL, Hotmail,  Yahoo, Gmail, etc.), and such corporation signs up for an enterprise account  with us or is considering an enterprise account, we may inform such corporation  of your use of our service, so that you can benefit from enterprise pricing and  any other benefits negotiated by the corporation for its registered users or  otherwise arising from such coordination.</li>
<li class="greenLi">We also engage agents and service providers who have access to  data, but only to process such data on our behalf and for our purposes under  confidentiality agreements.</li>
<li class="greenLi">We may share your information as required by law or in the  interest of protecting or exercising our or others' legal rights, e.g., without  limitation, in connection with requests from law enforcement officials and in  connection with court proceedings.</li>
<li class="greenLi">We may share or transfer your information in connection with a  prospective or actual sale, merger, transfer or other reorganization of all or  parts of our business.</li>
<li class="greenLi">We reserve the right to use and disclose any information  collected via the Site that is not in personally identifiable form.</li>
<li class="greenLi">We do not share, sell, rent or trade your personally  identifiable information with third parties for their promotional purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without limiting the  generality of the foregoing, note that we will NOT share your identity or your  individual responses to surveys that we conduct ourselves with customers who  may have commissioned such surveys; we only provide aggregate response data to survey  customers. But, as noted in the next section, we do not control how others may  use our tools when they conduct surveys through our website.</p>
<h3>Third Party Data  Collection Through Our Site</h3>
<p>When one of our users deploys our tools to send out survey response requests or  otherwise to collect data, e.g., through zoomerang.com, such user will receive  and process any responses. We will host, but not access such information,  except in connection with technical support, with the consent of the user who  conducted the survey, or in any other manner permitted by this privacy policy.  We post rules on how our tools should be used, however, we cannot control the  data processing practices of our users and we do not assume any responsibility  for actions of our users who conduct surveys or of any other third parties.</p>
<h3>Tell A Friend</h3>
<p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our Site, we  will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically  send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Site. SurveyMonkey  stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and  tracking the success of our referral program.</p>
<p>Your friend may  contact us at <a href="mailto:support@zoomerang.com">support@zoomerang.com</a> to request that  we remove this information from our database.</p>
<h3>Co-branded Sites</h3>
<p>From time to time we  may partner with third parties to provide co-branded sites. &nbsp;In the event that you provide personally  identifiable information on such a site, this privacy policy will continue to  apply, unless that site has its own privacy policy. You retain full rights to  you data and may either contact us at <a href="mailto:support@zoomerang.com">support@zoomerang.com</a> to change or remove your data or  alternatively you may ask us for a contact at the third party who can provide  this service.</p>
<h3>Opt-Out</h3>
<p>In connection with promotions  or other projects, we may ask you specifically whether you have objections  against a certain kind of data use or sharing. If you opt-out under such  circumstances, we will respect your decision. To opt-out of receiving further  commercial emails, sharing of your information with our affiliates or to  unsubscribe from services, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@zoomerang.com">support@zoomerang.com</a>. Please note that our affiliates and other  data recipients have their own data privacy policies, which may differ from  ours and you would have to contact them separately with respect to opt-out  requests.</p>
<h3>Access</h3>
<p>If personal information you have submitted through the Site is no longer  accurate, current, or complete, and you wish to update it, or you wish to  delete it, please update your profile on the Site (e.g. <a href="http://www.zoompanel.com/" target="_blank">www.zoompanel.com</a>) or send an email  to <a href="mailto:support@zoomerang.com">support@zoomerang.com</a>. We will amend any  information that is not updateable on the Site upon your email request.</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>Transmissions over the Internet are never 100% secure or error-free. We do,  however, take reasonable steps to protect your personal information from loss,  misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. For  example, we encrypt your registration information using secure socket layer  technology (SSL). To learn more about SSL follow this link: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security</a>. It is your  responsibility to safeguard any password and User ID you use to access the Site  and to notify us at <a href="mailto:support@zoomerang.com">support@zoomerang.com</a> if you ever  suspect that your password or User ID has been compromised. You are solely  responsible for any unauthorized use of the Site conducted via your password  and User ID.</p>
<h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
<p>The Site is intended for adults. We do not intentionally or knowingly collect  personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 and we  request that individuals under the age of 13 not submit any personal information  on the Site.</p>
<h3>Effective Date,  Amendments</h3>
<p>We reserve the right to change, modify, supplement or replace all or part of  this privacy policy from time to time and in our sole discretion, but will  alert you that changes have been made by indicating on the privacy policy the  date it was last updated. Before any material changes to this privacy policy we  will post a prominent notice on our Site before these changes go into effect.  When you visit the Site, you are accepting the current version of this privacy  policy as posted on the Site at that time. We recommend that users revisit this  privacy policy on occasion to learn of any changes.</p>
<h3>Contact Us</h3>
<p>Please feel free to contact us with any comments, questions, complaints or  suggestions you might have regarding the information practices described in  this statement. You contact us through this <a target="_blank" href="https://smforms.wufoo.com/forms/contact-surveymonkey-privacy/">privacy form</a> or by mail to SurveyMonkey, 285  Hamilton Avenue, Suite 500, Palo Alto, CA 94301.
