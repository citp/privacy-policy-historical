# Data Protection

Dear zooplus Customer,

We value your trust, which is why protecting your data, privacy rights and your right to know how your information is being collected, processed and used is of the greatest importance to us. Our data protection practices are in accordance with the German Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz/ ‘BDSG’) as well as the German Telemedia Act (Telemediengesetz/ ‘TMG’).

**1\. Collecting and using your data**

In order to process your order as best as possible, the data required for the transaction is stored and passed on to the delivery company. If you lose your information, please contact our customer services team ([www.zooplus.co.uk/contact](https://web.archive.org/contact/)) and we will send you a copy of your order. The personal data you submit to zooplus will not be passed on to any unauthorised third party outside the company.

a. It is important to us that we provide you with a customer-friendly order and delivery service, both before and during the delivery process. Depending on the Delivery Service Provider (DSP) you have selected, this may include the opportunity to select delivery time, date and location/ destination prior to parcel dispatch and during transit. In order for the DSP to provide a time frame for delivery of your parcel, we need to pass on personal details such as your address, email address and, where available, contact phone number to the delivery company. Depending on the DSP you have selected, you will receive an email or a text message with further details of your delivery and the possibility to change delivery options where possible.  
As a customer you can actively give us your permission to send you personalised special offers and advertisements by zooplus.co.uk. These will be sent to your postal or email address.  
This communication is a compulsory part of the contractual relationship with zooplus AG and cannot be avoided. More information can be found in our Terms and Conditions under section [4: Dispatch and delivery](https://web.archive.org/content/terms#delivery).

b. In addition, we also commission countries outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) to assist us with business processing and customer care. The transferred services include, for example, the listing of new products, the creation and translation of product descriptions in the shop, general shop maintenance, translation work, auditing and/or warehouse control. These service providers have access to personal customer data only to the extent they need in order to fulfil their tasks. We ensure that the transmission of customer data to these companies is carried out in accordance with the Data Protection Act. The "Standard Treaty II" of the European Union is applied. These are standard contract clauses for the transfer of personal data from the European Community to third countries, which are set by the European Commission in order to ensure an adequate level of data protection.

c. From time to time, we may also send your product information or advertising via post or email to the address given at the time of purchasing. You may opt out of the processing and use of your personal data for advertising purposes at any time by contacting our Customer Services team using our contact form, which can be found at the following web address:[ www.zooplus.co.uk/contact](https://web.archive.org/contact/)

**2\. Security standards you can trust**

In order to transfer personal data, zooplus.co.uk uses the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) security protocol with 128-bit encryption. This technology offers the best possible security and is also used by all major high street banks to protect online banking data. All payment methods offered by us are fully protected by these safety standards. You will be able to identify that the website is using encrypted data transmission by the closed padlock symbol visible in the bottom status bar of your browser.

**3\. Safer shopping with zooplus**

In detail, our security guarantee is as follows:

Our software, which uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) as standard, encrypts your personal data such as your name, address, bank account number and credit card number whenever you make an order. SSL is supported by most browsers and ensures that your data reaches our server in a form of code that is unreadable for unauthorised persons.

To date, no damage has been incurred by a zooplus customer due to the illegal use of their credit card or bank information. Should a case of misuse occur during a purchase on our website, please get in touch with your bank or credit card company. Should your bank or credit card company require you to pay an initial amount, we will reimburse you for this amount. A condition of this is that you contact your bank or credit card company immediately if you suspect your bank or credit card details have been used fraudulently.
