# ZooLoo Privacy Policy - Your Name. Your Domain. Your Life.

**What This Privacy Policy Covers**  
This policy covers how ZooLoo, along with its partners, (collectively, "ZooLoo," "we," "us," or "our") treats personal information that it collects and receives on ZooLoo.com. We are not in the business of selling information about you: we use information shared with us for the purpose of running and improving our services. This notice tells you what information we collect, steps we take to protect and secure it, how we use and share information, and finally, how you can contact us with questions or concerns.

**Information We Gather**  

  * ZooLoo collects personal information when you register with us, use ZooLoo products or services or post content on a ZooLoo web site. This information is typically limited to your email address, username, survey information and any information you post on your site. Your password is stored using a one way hash function.
  * ZooLoo may register a domain name and maintain ownership and control of it on your behalf. Any transfer of a domain name is subject to ZooLoo Terms of Service.
  * ZooLoo may also collect personal information if you enter into promotions or sweepstakes.
  * ZooLoo may automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookies, and the pages you request.
  * ZooLoo uses information for the following general purposes: products and services provision, identification and authentication, services improvement, support, contact, research, and anonymous reporting.

We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we enforce physical access controls to our buildings and files, and we authorize access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities.
  * If your subscription is auto-renewing, a recurring subscription will be created at our payment gateway and we store your billing information in our secure payment gateway for as long as necessary to carry out the terms of your subscription.
