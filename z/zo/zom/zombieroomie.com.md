# Zombie Roomie - Privacy Policy

_Zombie Roomie_ is owned and operated by John Wigger. **We value your readership and will not sell any information that is collected from visitors of zombieroomie.com, at any time, ever.**

Information is collected via cookies, which may log data regarding your visit such as your IP address and the name and/or location of your internet provider. The visitor may opt to enter additional information (such as name, valid e-mail address) to participate in the site’s interactive or community features, such as the comment system.

A “cookie” is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a Web site’s computers and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies can be used to target advertisements relevant to your interests, based on your visits to different Web sites, to provide traffic measurement and other analytics and to conduct research.

A “Web beacon” is an electronic file on a Web page that allows a Web site to count users who have visited that page, to access certain cookies and to provide auditing, research and reporting for advertisers.

When your browser requests a page that displays advertising from one of the Advertisers, the Advertiser may view, edit or set its own cookie through your browser. In addition, the Advertiser may place its own Web beacon in the page, which may be triggered by your browser’s request.

**Advertising data**

_Zombie Roomie_ has partnered with third-party advertisers to deliver ads (contextual and non-) that may be tailored to the visitor using information gathered by the code provided by these advertisers. Their privacy policies can be found at the following URLs: [Scribol](http://scribol.com/privacy-policy) and [Project Wonderful](http://www.projectwonderful.com/tos.php).
