					<h1>Zopim Privacy Policy</h1>
				</div>
					<div class="text">
						 April 29, 2008<br>
						We at Zopim respect your privacy and take the issue of Internet privacy very seriously.  
						This Policy applies to all of the products and services offered by Zopim or its subsidiaries 
						or affiliated companies.
						If you have any questions about this Policy, please feel free to contact us through our 
						website or email us at <u>support@zopim.com</u>. 
					</div>
					<div class="titles">
					1. Information we collect and how we use it
					</div>
						<div class="text">
						<p>
						1.1 Information you provide – As an end user, we generally do not require you to provide 
						any information.  However, you may still supply us with information such as email or 
						webpage address.  If you register for an account with us, we may ask you for personal 
						information such as name, contact details, account password, instant messaging ID or credit 
						card information.
						</p>
						<p>
						1.2 Cookies -Zopim use "cookies" to enable you to sign in to our services and to help personalize 
						your online experience. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web 
						page server. Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server in the domain 
						that issued the cookie to you. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your 
						computer.
						</p>
						<p>
					    1.2.1 Zopim uses cookies to store your preferences and other information on your computer in 
						order to save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information and to 
						display your personalized content and appropriate advertising on your later visits to these sites.  
						We store your unique ID number, and the time you signed in, in an encrypted cookie on your hard disk. 
						This cookie allows you to move from page to page at the site without having to sign in again on 
						each page. When you sign out, these cookies are deleted from your computer. We also use cookies to 
						improve the sign in experience. For example, your e-mail address may be stored in a cookie that 
						will remain on your computer after you sign out. This cookie allows your e-mail address to be 
						pre-populated, so that you will only need to type your password the next time you sign in. If you 
						are using a public computer or do not otherwise want this information to be stored, you can select 
						the appropriate radio button on the sign-in page, and this cookie will not be used.
					    </p>
						<p>
						1.2.2 You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept 
						cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you 
						choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of our 
						products and services that depend on cookies.
						</p>
						<p>
						1.3 Log information - When you use Zopim services, our servers automatically record information that 
						your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include information such as 
						your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of 
						your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
						</p>
						<p>
						1.4 User communications - When you send email or other communication to Zopim, we may retain those 
						communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services. 
						</p>

					1. Information Sharing
					</div>
						<div class="text">
						<p>
						2.1 Zopim processes personal information on our servers in Singapore. 
						</p>
						<p>
						2.2 Zopim only shares personal information on our server with other companies or individuals outside 
						of Zopim in the following limited circumstances:<br>
						2.2.1 We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.<br>
					    2.2.2 We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to<br>
			            </p><blockquote>
						(a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request;<br>
			            (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof;<br>
			            (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or;<br>
			            (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of Zopim, its users or the public as 
						required or permitted by law; and
						we undertake to inform you of such disclosures at least 48 hours before hand, or as early as possible in accordance with governing laws.<br>
						</blockquote>
						<p></p>
						<p>
						2.3 If Zopim becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide 
						notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
						</p>
						<p>
						2.4 We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users 
						who searched for a particular term, for example, or how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. Such information does 
						not identify you individually. 
						</p>
						</div>
					<div class="titles">
					3. Data Integrity
					</div>
						<div class="text">
						<p>
						Zopim processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Policy 
						or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure 
						that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services. We take reasonable 
						steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to 
						update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.
						</p>
						</div>
					<div class="titles">
					4. Changes To This Policy
					</div>
						<div class="text">
						<p>
						Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Policy without your 
						explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor.  Regardless, we will post any Policy changes on this page and, 
						if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice, usually via email. When we post changes to this Statement, 
						we will revise the "last updated" date at the top of this statement.  We therefore encourage you to periodically review this page 
						for updates to this policy.
