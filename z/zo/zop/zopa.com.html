      <h3>Service Messages</h3>
      <ol class="terms">
        <li>Zopa hates spam and will never send you unsolicited communications. There are some messages ("Service Messages") that we will need to send you. These may be sent via email, post or text message and include notifications about your loan application, Repayments or balance if you are a borrower and Information about your balance and account status if you are a lender. The full list is:
          <ol>
            <li>Welcome messages with the Information you need to get started;</li>

        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Occasional Updates</h3>
      <ol start="2" class="terms">
        <li>When you register on Zopa you are offered the option to receive our occasional updates. These messages notify you about new features on the site, ask your opinion, and tell you about services you might not be using yet. We only send these messages when there is something worthwhile to tell you about. If you decide you no longer want to receive these messages you can change your contact preferences in the "My Contact Preferences" area once you're logged in.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>General Operational Purposes</h3>
      <ol start="3" class="terms">
        <li>We as Information controller may use your Personal Information for: statistical analysis; to develop and improve our products; to update your records; to identify which of our, or others', products might interest you; to assess lending and insurance risks; to arrange, underwrite and administer insurance and handle claims; to identify, prevent, detect or tackle fraud,
            money
            laundering
            and other crime; to carry out regulatory checks; keeping you informed about your lending or borrowing and for market research. In addition:
            <ol>
                <li>If false or inaccurate Information is provided and fraud is identified, details will be passed to fraud prevention agencies.</li>
                <li>Law enforcement agencies may access and use this Information.</li>
                <li>We and other organisations may also access and use this Information to prevent fraud and money laundering, for example, when:
                    <ol>
                        <li>checking details on applications for credit and credit-related or other facilities</li>
                        <li>managing credit and credit-related accounts or facilities</li>
                        <li>recovering debt</li>
                        <li>checking details on proposals and claims for all types of insurance</li>
                        <li>checking details of job applicants and employees</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Please contact us at contactus@zopa.com if you want to receive details of the relevant fraud prevention agencies.</li>
                <li>We and other organisations may access and use from other countries the Information recorded by fraud prevention agencies.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>We will keep your Personal Information confidential and only give it to others for the purposes we explained when you applied to us, and:
          <ol>
            <li>if you ask us to or give us your permission to do so;</li>
            <li>to a credit reference agency to check your identity and to prevent fraud (they will also keep a record of your request and use it whenever anyone applies to be authenticated in your name);</li>
            <li>if you are a Borrower, to tell credit reference agencies that you have an account and how you run that account;</li>
            <li>to our agents and subcontractors, acting for us or for Lenders, to use for the purpose of operating the Lending Platform and obtaining payment;</li>
            <li>to investigate, prevent or detect fraud or carry out checks against money laundering;</li>
            <li>to share Information via an organisation which provides a centralised application matching service which it collects from and about mortgage and/or credit applications, for the purpose of preventing and detecting fraud;</li>
            <li>to a reputable, licensed credit broker in the event that you apply to borrow money at Zopa, your application is declined or the loan monies are otherwise unavailable and we reasonably believe that the credit broker may be able to help you obtain a loan;</li>
            <li>to trace debtors and recover debt;</li>
            <li>to meet our obligations to any relevant regulatory authority or taxing authority;</li>
            <li>if we have to by law, the law allows it, or it is in the public interest;</li>
            <li>if all of the assets which we use to operate the Lending Platform (or substantially all of them) are acquired by a third party, we may transfer personal Information we then hold to that party so that the acquirer can continue to operate the Lending Platform; and</li>
            <li>each Business Borrower may be contacted to provide Information that will be used for statistical purposes to assess the effectiveness of the Business Finance Partnership programme. Any such Information will be treated in aggregate and without specific reference to your business activities.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>We will check your details with a fraud prevention agency or agencies, and if you give us false or inaccurate Information and we suspect fraud, we will record this. We and other organisations (including law enforcement agencies) may use, search and access these records from the UK and other countries (e.g. offshore operations of UK businesses) to:
          <ol>
            <li>help make decisions about credit and credit related services, for you;</li>
            <li>help make decisions on motor, household, credit, life and other insurance proposals and insurance claims, for you and members of your household;</li>
            <li>trace debtors, recover debt, prevent fraud, and to manage your accounts or insurance policies;</li>
            <li>check your identity to prevent money laundering, unless you furnish us with other satisfactory proof of identity;</li>
            <li>checking details of job applicants and employees;</li>
            <li>Please email contactus@zopa.com if you want to receive details of the relevant fraud prevention agencies.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Any credit reference agency you search through Zopa will keep a record of any search, and other Lenders may use it to assess applications they receive from you in the future.</li>
        <li>As a general rule, we will give you at least 28 days notice if we decide to file a default on your credit reference file. However, we may not always give you notice beforehand, for example, if we plan to take court action.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Transfer outside the UK or EEA</h3>
      <ol start="8" class="terms">
        <li>We may transfer your Personal Information abroad to countries whose Information protection laws are less strict than in the UK. If so, we will ensure the Information is held securely to standards as least as good as those in the UK and only used for the purposes set out in this clause.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Access to Your Personal Data</h3>
      <ol start="9" class="terms">
        <li>Under the Data Protection Act 1998, you have a right to access certain personal records we, credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies hold about you. This is called a "subject access request", which you can make by writing to us at contactus@zopa.com. A fee may be payable, but we will not charge you until we have told you how much the fee is and what it is for,   and you have told us you still want to proceed.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Contacting Other Customers</h3>
      <ol start="10" class="terms">
        <li>We do not disclose your Personal Information to any other Zopa Customers unless it is necessary to enforce any of your Loan Contracts. If you receive such Information, you are not permitted to use it directly, other than in communication with us about your Loan Contracts.</li>
        <li>You agree that, in the course of generating and managing your Loan Contracts, and operating My Zopa, the Lending Platform will need to send to Lenders and their assignees or the Borrower, as the case may be, certain transactional Information (for example, unique identifier, loan amount and Repayment details) but not your full name, post code address or payment details. We will not be liable for any use or misuse of the transactional data by others, but you must inform us of any misuse of the Lending Platform of which you are aware.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Monitoring and Recording</h3>
      <ol start="12" class="terms">
          <li>We may monitor, record, store and use any telephone, email or other communication with you in order to check any instructions given to us, for training purposes, for crime prevention and to improve the quality of our customer service.</li>
