# Zondervan

Zondervan (including Zonderkidz and Vida) is part of the News America Group, which has adopted a set of Privacy Principles applicable to all its U.S.-based companies. Zondervan has implemented those Principles in this Privacy Policy, which describes how we collect, use, and share personally identifiable information (“PII”) we obtain from and about individuals located in the U.S. both online and off-line.  
 

**Children’s Privacy Policy**

Some of our online activities are directed to children under 13. When those activities involve the collection of PII, we provide additional privacy protections. To read about our protections that relate to the online collection of PII from children under 13 refer to the “Kids and Internet Safety” section below.

From time to time Zondervan may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law, our PII collection and use practices, the features of our websites, or technology. Therefore, you should review it periodically so that you’re up to date on our most current policies and practices.  
 

**COLLECTION : COLLECTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (“PII”) BY ZONDERVAN**

**General -** Zondervan collects personally identifiable information ("PII"—that is, information such as your full name, email address, mailing address, or telephone number) only in order to create or enhance our relationship with you. When we collect PII from you it’s because you’re voluntarily submitting the information to us in order to participate in activities like subscription registrations, surveys, sweepstakes, contests, games, forums, in connection with content or suggestions you submit to us, chats or bulletin boards, or because you want us to furnish you with products, services, or information. On those occasions when we obtain PII from a third party, we use only reputable sources of such information.

**Cookies -** Cookies are small bits of information that the Zondervan websites place on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies remember information about your activities on the site and enable the operator of the site to make your visits to our websites more enjoyable.

We use cookies in a variety of ways, such as allowing for easier logon and relating your use of our websites to non-personally identifiable information you have provided to us, so that we can limit the online ads we display to you to those we believe are consistent with your interests.

We may also use cookies or similar tools to relate your use of our websites to PII obtained from you or a reputable third party. For example, if you ask us to send you information about our upcoming products or promotions, cookie and/or click stream data about your activities on Zondervan websites may allow us to determine the best time to send this information, as well as limit the material we send you to the types of items we believe you will find interesting, based upon your activities on our sites and your preferences. However, if we wish to coordinate your personal and website activity information in this manner, we will obtain your express affirmative consent.

You can program your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely.  
 

**NOTICE : ZONDERVAN WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH NOTICE ABOUT ITS PII COLLECTION PRACTICES**

When Zondervan collects PII from you, we’ll make sure you’re informed about who’s collecting the information, how and why the information is being collected, and the types of uses we’ll make of the information.

This Policy describes the types of other companies that may want to send you information about their products and services and therefore may want to share your personal information (See “Use” below). However, we’ll notify you of your options regarding our use of your PII, including whether we can share it with outside companies, before we use it for a purpose other than the one for which it was originally collected or disclose it to third parties, typically at the time of collection (See “Choice” below).

Sometimes we collect PII from consumers in manual format, such as a post card or subscription form. Providing detailed notice in those situations often proves impractical, so consumers will instead be provided with a short notice that describes how to obtain the full text of this Policy and other relevant information from us.

Zondervan’s websites may be linked to Internet sites operated by other companies. Some of these third party sites may be co-branded with a Zondervan logo, even though they’re not operated or maintained by Zondervan, such as websites owned and operated by our authors. Zondervan’s websites may also carry advertisements from other companies. Although we choose our business partners and advertisers carefully, Zondervan is not responsible for the privacy practices of websites operated by third parties that are linked to or from our sites, or for the privacy practices of third parties that advertise on our websites. Once you’ve left a Zondervan website via such a link or by clicking on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party to determine how they’ll handle any PII they collect from you.

Zondervan’s websites may also be linked to sites operated by companies affiliated with Zondervan. Visitors to those affiliated sites should still refer to their separate privacy policies and practices, which may differ in some respects from this Policy.  
 

**CHOICE : ZONDERVAN WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH CHOICES ABOUT THE USE OF YOUR PII**

Zondervan will provide you with the opportunity to choose whether your PII may be used for purposes different from the purpose for which it was submitted. You’ll also be able to choose whether your information is shared with companies that are not affiliated with Zondervan (i.e., not part of the News America Group).  
 

**USE : ZONDERVAN’S USE OF PII**

Zondervan will use your PII in a manner that’s consistent with this Policy and only for the purpose for which it’s submitted, unless other uses are disclosed and you allow us to use your information in these other ways.

Zondervan may share your PII with companies that are affiliated with us, that is, are part of the News America Group of companies. We may also share your PII with companies that are not affiliated with Zondervan but would like to send you information about their products and services. For example, Zondervan may offer a sweepstakes or contest in conjunction with a co-sponsor, and the co-sponsor may send you information concerning its products or services. However, you’ll always have the opportunity to instruct us not to share your information with third parties.

Zondervan’s employees, agents, and contractors must have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to your PII. Outside contractors or agents who help us manage our information activities (i.e., sweepstakes administration, order fulfillment, statistical analyses) may only use PII to provide Zondervan with a specific service and not for any other purpose.

If Zondervan obtains PII from a third party, such as a business partner, our use of this information is governed by this Policy.

There may be instances when Zondervan may disclose PII without providing you with a choice in order to protect the legal rights of Zondervan, other companies within the News America Group or their employees, agents, and contractors; to protect the safety and security of visitors to our websites; to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or to comply with the law or legal process. In addition, if Zondervan sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, Zondervan may transfer your PII to a third party as part of that transaction.  
 

**SECURITY : ZONDERVAN PROTECTS THE SECURITY OF PII**

Zondervan uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel, and physical measures to safeguard PII in its possession against loss, theft, and unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification. In addition, we use reasonable methods to make sure that PII is accurate, up-to-date, and appropriately complete.  
 

**ACCESS : HOW TO ACCESS OR CORRECT YOUR PII, OR STOP ALL FUTURE COMMUNICATIONS FROM ZONDERVAN**

You may review PII about you from our records at anytime. If you’d like to know the types of information that Zondervan collects from visitors to its websites, please send your request using our CONTACT US page [LINK TO THE CONTACT US PAGE]. Or write to Zondervan, Attn: Internet Team, 5300 Patterson Avenue SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49530. If you’d like to know whether Zondervan has collected PII about you, please send us the activities that you participated in on our websites which requested PII. After reviewing the relevant databases, we’ll confirm whether we’ve collected such information about you.

Prior to changing any information about you or stopping to communicate with you, Zondervan requires that you provide proof of your name and address, such as a valid driver’s license. Once we determine that the information provided is satisfactory, we’ll immediately modify the information about you and/or refrain from collecting PII about you and/or communicating with you in the future, if you so request. However, there may be residual information that will remain within our databases that may or may not contain PII. This residual information will not be given to any third party or used for any commercial purpose.  
 

**REMEDIES AND COMPLIANCE: HOW TO CONTACT ZONDERVAN ABOUT PRIVACY CONCERNS**

If you have any complaints about Zondervan’s compliance with this Policy, have been unable to obtain or modify your PII, or to prevent Zondervan from collecting your PII, or to stop Zondervan from communicating with you, please contact Kyran Cassidy, Esq., Assistant General Counsel at: HarperCollins Publishers Inc., 10 East 53rd Street, New York, NY 10022; kyran [dot] cassidy [at] harpercollins [dot] com (subject: Zondervan%20Privacy%20Concerns) ; or tel. no.: (212) 207-7969.

**KIDS AND INTERNET SAFETY**

We at Zondervan (including Zonderkidz and Vida) understand that the Internet presents an opportunity for us to reach the public in new and exciting ways with information about our programming, fun games, exciting sweepstakes and contests, email, chat rooms, bulletin boards, and other forms of interactivity. Zondervan also recognizes the privacy concerns of parents, and the importance of protecting the privacy of the information we collect from children on our websites. Parents of children can be confident that any personal information that may be provided to our websites will be collected and maintained in accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). Zondervan encourages parents to supervise their children’s activities online and to participate with their children’s online activities whenever possible. However, we understand that parents may not always be able to supervise their children’s activities on the Internet. That’s why Zondervan has developed websites that parents can feel are safe for their children and kids will find cool, informative, educational, and fun! Because there’s always room for improvement, Zondervan welcomes any suggestions on how to make our site a better, safer place to hang out.  
 

**COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN UNDER 13**

When a visitor to our site is under the age of 13, Zondervan does not require the disclosure of more personally identifiable information (“PII”) than is reasonably necessary for him or her to participate in an activity as a condition of such participation. Zondervan may use different types of PII submitted to our websites by children under 13 in a variety of ways, which are described below. In each instance, we comply with the parental consent requirements of COPPA.

1\. Use of a Child’s Information by Zondervan

— We may collect a child’s email address in connection with a contest, sweepstakes, or game for the sole purpose of communicating with the child on a one-time-only basis (i.e., to contact a contest winner). This information will not be used to re-contact the child, and will be deleted from our records when the contest or game is over. Parental consent will be obtained before we send the winner a prize.

— We may collect a child’s email address in order to respond more than once to a child’s specific request. For example, the child may want to subscribe to an online newsletter or receive other online communications from Zondervan. In these instances Zondervan will also obtain a parent’s email address along with the child’s. Before any further contact with the child, Zondervan will send an email to the parent (a) notifying him or her we have collected the child’s email address in order to respond more than once to the child’s request for a subscription, information, etc; (b) informing the parent that he or she can refuse us permission to contact the child, and how to do so; and © informing the parent that if he or she does not respond to the email within 72 hours, Zondervan may use the child’s information for the purpose for which it was submitted.

— We may collect a child’s PII (including name, email address, mailing address, and phone number) for such activities as chats, forums, surveys, games, guestbooks, bulletin boards, requests for suggestions, subscription registrations, content submissions, requests for products or services, or requests for additional information. In these instances we will initially collect only the child’s name and online contact information and the email address of the child’s parent. Before using this information for any purpose, we will send the parent an email that (a) informs the parent that we wish to collect and use the child’s personal information and need the parent’s consent to do so, and (b) provides the parent with a link to access to this Privacy Policy, which describes our information collection and use policies as required by COPPA. If the proposed use of the child’s personal information does not involve disclosure to a third party, then Zondervan will ask the parent to provide consent by return email. Upon receipt of the email consent, we will send the parent a confirming email. If the proposed use of the child’s PII involves disclosure to third parties, the email we send to the parent will ask the parent either to (i) return by postal mail or fax a consent form that will be attached to the email, or (ii) call a toll-free number where consent can be given over the phone. If parental consent is not obtained by one of these methods within one week, Zondervan will delete all of the child’s and parent’s PII from its records. In addition, parents can revoke a prior consent at any time.

— We may collect a child’s name and email address to the extent reasonably necessary to protect the security of this Site, to protect against liability or as required or permitted by law. Information collected for these reasons will not be used for any other purpose.

2\. Sharing Children’s Personal Information With Third Parties. Zondervan may share a child’s PII with other News America Group affiliates who may send you information about their products or services. These third parties have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal information they obtain from Zondervan. As noted above, parents may exercise their option not to consent to the disclosure of their child’s PII to third parties. Parents may consent to Zondervan’s collection and use of a child’s PII without consenting to the disclosure of the information to third parties.  
 

**LINKS /CO-BRANDED SITES**

As noted in the Privacy Policy, our websites may link directly to sites operated by third party advertisers, business partners, and affiliated companies. Those sites, which are not controlled by Zondervan, may collect PII from your child. Parents should therefore check the relevant site’s privacy policy to understand how it collects and uses children’s personal information. Zondervan will not share in any personal information obtained by a site from a child under the age of 13 unless that site follows the requirements of COPPA.  
 

**REVIEWING AND MAKING CHANGES TO PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM CHILDREN UNDER 13**

Parents of children under age 13 may review or delete personal information about their children from our records at any time. If you’d like to know the types of information we collect about children, please contact us using our Contact Us page or write to us at Zondervan, Attn: Internet Marketing, 5300 Patterson Avenue SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49530. If you’d like to know whether we’ve collected personal information about your child, please provide us with the activities that he or she participated in on one of our websites which requested personal information. After reviewing the relevant databases, we’ll confirm whether we’ve collected such information about your child.

Prior to changing or deleting such information, we require that you provide us with proof of your name and address, such as a valid driver’s license, and proof that your child resides with you or is otherwise in your custody. Once we’ve determined such information is satisfactory, we’ll immediately delete or modify your child’s information in our database and/or refrain from collecting any other personally identifiable information from your child in the future, if you so request. However, there may be residual information that will remain within our databases that may or may not contain personally identifiable information. This residual information will not be given to any other third party or used for any commercial purpose.
