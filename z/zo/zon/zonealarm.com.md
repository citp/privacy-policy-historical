What Information We Gather/Track

You may decide whether to proceed with any activity that requests personally identifiable information. If you do not wish to provide the requested information, however, you may not be able to complete the transaction. We do not collect information from individuals under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, we ask that you do not submit any personally identifiable information through the Site. If we have specific knowledge that an individual under the age of 13 has submitted personally identifiable information to the Site, we will delete such information permanently and without notice. 

Except as described below, ZoneAlarm will only disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties if acting under a good faith belief that such action is necessary (1) to conform to legal requirements; (2) to protect and defend the rights or property of ZoneAlarm; (3) to enforce the ZoneAlarm Terms of Service; or (4) in the event of a merger, acquisition or sale of all or substantially all ZoneAlarm's assets relating to the business in connection with which the information was collected. ZoneAlarm collects personally identifiable information that can be divided into the following categories: 

> **ZoneAlarm Product Registration Information** : Some ZoneAlarm products ask you for certain personally identifiable information as part of the installation/registration process (including but not limited to your name, email address, credit card information and connection type and number of computers). Certain of this information is necessary in order to conclude the transaction, and for applicable products, to be eligible to receive technical support. If you provide us with personally identifiable information, and select the "Inform me about important updates and news" option on the purchase confirmation page or in the in the "Registration Information" section located in the "Configuration Panel" of the "Control Panel" in the ZoneAlarm product, we use this information to send you communications, including informative emails/newsletters about ZoneAlarm product upgrades, product updates, new products, and services, and to provide you with special offers that may be of interest to you, including paid advertisements from third parties. In the event you no longer wish to receive such information, you may choose to opt out of receiving further communications by complying with the procedures listed in the "Updating/Unsubscribing Your Email Address" section of this Privacy Policy. Except in the case of Partner Products (see below), ZoneAlarm keeps personally identifiable information collected in the course of installation/registration of ZoneAlarm's products confidential and does not sell, trade, or exchange mailing lists with any organization. 
> 
> **Partner Product Purchases** : Some products offered via the Site are third-party products ("Partner Products") offered by ZoneAlarm's partners ("ZoneAlarm Partners"). If you purchase Partner Products from this Site, ZoneAlarm will ask you to provide personally identifiable information as part of the installation/registration process (including but not limited to your name, email address and credit card information). You are required to provide this information in order to conclude the transaction. ZoneAlarm provides this information, except credit card information, to the applicable ZoneAlarm Partner to enable the applicable Partner to register your purchase and verify support eligibility. ZoneAlarm will require the applicable ZoneAlarm Partner to use your information only to verify support eligibility and, in the case of certain Partner Products, to provide you required updates. ZoneAlarm will not share this information with any other third party. 
> 
> **Co-branded Pages** : ZoneAlarm provides commerce functionality for selected partner companies who wish to offer ZoneAlarm products to their customers and/or users. If you come to the Site by accessing a link provided by a partner company, you will be informed that your information (not including credit card) will be shared with the partner company. You will have the option to "opt-out" of promotional communications from both ZoneAlarm and the partner company when you register your product. 
> 
> **Credit Card Information** : If you use a credit card to purchase products via this Site, your name as it appears on the credit card, the credit card number, expiration date and billing address will be encrypted as it passes over the Internet. ZoneAlarm does not record or keep your credit card information for online credit-card transactions; rather such information is simply passed through to our contracted payment processing vendor. ZoneAlarm may access such information through the payment processing company, but does not do so except to process refunds or adjustments, or when annual renewal of subscription is elected, and to the extent necessary in the event of nonpayment or disputed payments, or as may be necessary for ZoneAlarm's compliance, in ZoneAlarm's discretion, with applicable law. 
> 
> **Technical Support** : If you request technical support online, we will ask you for information necessary to complete the transaction such as your name, email address and information about your computer hardware, software, and the nature of the problem you are experiencing. In the course of providing support, your data may be transmitted to service providers that are under contract to ZoneAlarm and have agreed to abide by the provisions of this privacy policy. Such transmissions of your data are encrypted and secure. 
> 
> **Volume Sales Form** : If you request volume licensing information online, we will ask you for information necessary to complete the transaction such as company name, email address, needs assessment and your organization's primary business activity. 
> 
> **Partner Application** : If you request participation in the partner program online, we will ask you for information necessary to complete the transaction such as company name, email address, and company profile.
> 
> **Analyzing Security Alerts, "SmartDefense Advisor"** : When the ZoneAlarm product detects a security threat to your computer, you can click on the "More Information" button from the product dialog box. At that point, the product sends the information about the event and your computer to ZoneAlarm to be analyzed. ZoneAlarm will display in your browser more specific guidance about the security information.* 
> 
> * - One year of updates and service access included with purchase of a ZoneAlarm product; annual subscriptions available for subsequent updates and service access. 
> 
> **Loss of Internet Connectivity During Use of ZoneAlarm Products** : If you have installed certain ZoneAlarm products, in very rare instances you may lose connectivity to the Internet due to an error on your computer or a hacker threat. In this rare event, you will receive instructions from ZoneAlarm on how to regain connectivity to the Internet. You will be given the opportunity to submit an error report to ZoneAlarm for diagnostic purposes only. Your decision to submit an error report to ZoneAlarm is purely voluntary. If you do submit such an error report, ZoneAlarm will copy error logs from your computer for error diagnosis. Any personally identifiable information contained in such error logs is purely incidental, will not be otherwise used by ZoneAlarm or shared with any third parties, and will be permanently deleted from our systems upon completion of our analysis. 
> 
> **Surveys** : ZoneAlarm periodically requests information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and you have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. ZoneAlarm uses both in-house and third-party Web-Based Interviewing Systems to compile the surveys. Information requested in the surveys may include broad demographic information (such as zip code, age level) for aggregate use and does not identify the user. No cookies are used. Survey information is not sold, shared, or rented to any third party, and is used internally solely by ZoneAlarm for purposes of improving the use and satisfaction of this Site, Services, and our products. 

**Affiliates**  
When a user or a company signs up to be a marketing program affiliate, they do so through a third-party provider of affiliate marketing programs. Such third-party provider does share personally identifiable information about affiliates with ZoneAlarm. This information is not sold, shared, or rented to any third party, and is used internally only to manage and maintain relationships with affiliates. The ZoneAlarm privacy policy governs the information that is collected on [Element5](https://sshop.element5.com/esales/affiliates/signup.html?publisherid=50319&md5=72bf9e758cd478830cbadf920601db92&languageid=1) and this information will be used in accordance with the ZoneAlarm privacy policy. 

If You Opt to Receive Communications, How We Will Contact You 

> **Email**  
>  With your permission, ZoneAlarm will send you communications, including informative emails/newsletters about product upgrades, product updates, new products, and services. These communications provide you with special offers that may be of interest to you, and may include paid advertisements from third parties. ZoneAlarm uses a third-party provider of outbound email technology to send email from their servers on our behalf. The provider does not collect information about you but does collect requests to unsubscribe.   
> **Special Offers**  
>  ZoneAlarm has relationships with business partners that provide a number of third-party products and services. With your permission, ZoneAlarm will notify you about special offers that may include links to third-party products and services. 

Site Functionality

**Cookies**  
Persistent "cookies" are small pieces of information that your browser stores on your computer on behalf of a Web site that you have visited. The Site does not use persistent cookies. In order to complete transactions on our site, we do use session cookies. These session cookies do not collect information about you, only about your browser session, and they are destroyed when you close your browser. No data is stored on your computer.

The use of third party cookies is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies.

Third parties may be placing and reading cookies on your browsers or using web beacons to collect information in the course of advertising being served. 

**Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)**  
Our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information. 

**Log Files**  
We (ZoneAlarm and/or our contracted web analytics provider(s)) do keep track of the domains from which you access our Site and Services on the World Wide Web, and may log IP addresses or other identifiers for statistical purposes. We do this to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use to identify and analyze trends and the results of our marketing efforts, to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer the Site and Services, and analyze users' movements. We may periodically share aggregate demographic information with our business partners. IP addresses and other identifiers are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

**Security of Your Information**  
All information gathered on the Site is stored and maintained in secure facilities. In addition, internal security provides that this information is coded with restricted access, and our servers are kept in a secure, locked environment that limits access to authorized personnel only. All ZoneAlarm employees, and all external service providers who may process and/or store customer data, are briefed about the company's privacy and security policies on a regular basis. The Site is regularly tested for security breaches to ensure that all information collected is secure from unauthorized viewing. Any service providers with whom ZoneAlarm contracts, and who receive, store, or process personally identifiable customer data, have committed to abide by the provisions of this privacy policy. All transmissions of personally identifiable customer data are encrypted and secure.

When you enter sensitive information (such as your credit card number) on our forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). 

If you have any questions about the security at our Site, you can send an email to [privacy@zonealarm.com](mailto:privacy@zonealarm.com). 

Please note that this email address will reject messages with attachments of any kind.

**Behavioral Targeting / Re-Targeting**  
We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish not to have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking [here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/)

Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.

**ZoneAlarm Services**  
In the course of normal operation, ZoneAlarm security products may contact servers operated by, or under contract to, ZoneAlarm. These communications are for the purpose of providing more specific information about security threats, system configuration, and the presence or properties of software, as well as to allow ZoneAlarm to aggregate data in the interest of improving our Services and products. 

No personally identifiable information is gathered during interactions with ZoneAlarm Services. We may aggregate data in order to analyze geographic or other demographic patterns, and may make such aggregated data available to Partners. Such aggregations will not reveal personally identifiable information about particular users. 

You may opt out of these communications with ZoneAlarm during the installation and registration process. If you opt out, no information will be sent to ZoneAlarm; however, this may diminish the advisory, diagnostic, or other content being served to you. 

**Links to 3 rd Party Sites**  
Our Site includes links to other Web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of ZoneAlarm. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any Web site you visit. 

**Social Media Widgets**  
Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button and Widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it. 

**Public Forums**  
Our Web site offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personally identifiable information from our blog or community forum, contact us at [privacy@zonealarm.com](mailto:privacy@zonealarm.com). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personally identifiable information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
