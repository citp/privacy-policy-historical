        <p>This Privacy Policy consists of two sections. Section I describes Zondervan's 
          policies that apply to the collection, use and disclosure of personal 
          information furnished to us by visitors to our Site who are age 13 and 
          over. Section II describes the special additional policies Zondervan 
          applies to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information 
          about visitors to our Site who are under age 13. Parents should read 
          both Sections to obtain a full understanding of Zondervan's privacy 
          policies and practices. </p>
        <p><b>I. POLICIES THAT APPLY TO INDIVIDUALS AGE 13 AND OVER</b></p>
        <p><b>COLLECTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION BY ZONDERVAN</b></p>
        <p> General. Personally identifiable information about visitors to this 
          Site (that is, information such as a visitor's name, email address, 
          mailing address, or telephone number) is collected only when knowingly 
          and voluntarily submitted. Such information may be requested in connection 
          with our sweepstakes, contests, games, surveys, forums, subscription 
          registrations, content submissions, chats, bulletin boards, guestbooks, 
          requests for suggestions, visitors' requests for products or services, 
          and visitors' requests for additional information. Zondervan does not 
          require a visitor to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary 
          to participate in the online activity he or she is interested in.</p>
        <p> Joint Collection of Personal Information. Sometimes Zondervan collects 
          personal information jointly with business partners or sponsors. The 
          identity of the entities collecting personal information will be clear 
          at the time your personal information is collected. A detailed description 
          of shared use can also be found in the specific Terms of Use for this 
          Site, and in the rules for specific sweepstakes and promotions. </p>
        <p><b>WHAT ZONDERVAN DOES (AND DOESN'T DO) WITH THE PERSONAL INFORMATION 
          WE COLLECT</b></p>
        <p> General. Zondervan uses personally identifiable information only for 
          the purpose for which it is submitted unless we disclose other uses 
          at the time of collection, in which case you will have the opportunity 
          to instruct us not to use your data in other ways (i.e., "opt-out").</p>
        <p>Sharing Personal Information. Zondervan may share personally identifiable 
          information with other News Corp. affiliates or with some of our business 
          partners who would like to send you information about their products 
          or services. However, when we collect your information you will have 
          the opportunity to instruct us not to share your information in these 
          ways (i.e., opt-out"). </p>
        <p><br>
          <b>LINKS/CO-BRANDED SITES</b></p>
        <p>Zondervan has established relationships with advertisers and reputable 
          business partners that allow visitors to our Site to link directly to 
          sites operated by these partners. Some of these sites, may be "co-branded" 
          with a Zondervan logo; however, they are not operated or maintained 
          by Zondervan. These sites may collect personal information from you. 
          This Privacy Policy will apply to any personal information we obtain 
          in this manner from our partners.</p>
        <p>Zondervan chooses its advertisers and business partners carefully. 
          However, Zondervan is not responsible for the content or practices of 
          web sites operated by third parties that are linked to our Site. These 
          links are meant for the user's convenience only. Links to third party 
          sites do not constitute sponsorship, endorsement or approval by Zondervan 
          of the content, policies or practices of such third party sites. We 
          are not responsible for any information these sites may obtain and do 
          not oversee their policies or practices in collecting personal information. 
          Therefore, once you have left this Site via such a link, you should 
          check the applicable privacy policy of the third party site. </p>
        <p>This Site may also be linked to web sites operated by companies affiliated 
          with Zondervan and/or News Corp. Zondervan may share information collected 
          by these affiliated companies; however, this Privacy Policy will apply 
          to any personal information we receive in this manner. Visitors to our 
          affiliated sites should still refer to their separate privacy policies 
          and practices when providing any personally identifiable information.</p>
        <p><b>NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</b></p>
        <p>When visitors come to our Site, we collect and aggregate information 
          indicating, among other things, which web pages were visited, the order 
          in which they were visited, and which hyperlinks, if any, were "clicked" 
          by the visitor. Zondervan, like most major web sites, collects such 
          information by placing small bits of information, known as "cookies", 
          on the hard drive of your computer to log IP addresses, operating system 
          (e.g., Windows or Macintosh), type of browser software (e.g., Netscape 
          Navigator or Internet Explorer), and Internet service providers (e.g., 
          AOL or NET.COM) used by each visitor to the Site. </p>
        <p>Cookies enable us to do a number of things to make your visit and future 
          visits to the site more enjoyable. For example, cookies allow a visitor 
          to quickly log on to a site he/she has used before by storing a password. 
          By tracking how many people visit our Site and where they go, we are 
          able to determine which part of the Site users like the best, which 
          part needs some improvement and what changes should be made. By obtaining 
          this information, we are able to continually improve our Site and bring 
          you the best online experience possible.</p>
        <p>Although the cookie itself does not collect any personally identifiable 
          information about a visitor, and Zondervan does not use cookies in order 
          to obtain such information, the cookie can be used to determine the 
          IP address of the visitor's Internet Service Provider and the geographic 
          location of his or her point of connectivity to the Internet. Zondervan 
          may also disclose some of the non-personally identifiable information 
          we obtain to advertisers to inform them how many people have seen or 
          linked to their advertisements on our Site. However, we do not disclose 
          personally identifiable information to these advertisers. Visitors may 
          also receive cookies from third parties, but Zondervan cannot control 
          the content of these cookies.</p>
        <p>Zondervan does not save credit card information in a cookie.</p>
        <p>You should consult your browser owner's manual for instructions on 
          how to refuse cookies.</p>
        <p><br>
          <b>REVIEWING AND MAKING CHANGES TO PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</b> 
        </p>
        <p>Visitors may review or delete personal information from our records 
          at any time. If you would like to know the types of personal information 
          Zondervan collects from visitiors to the Site, please contact us at 
          <a href="mailto:zpub@zph.com">zpub@zph.com</a> or write to us at Zondervan 
          Publishing House Attn: Internet Team,5300 Patterson SE, Grand Rapids, 
          MI 49530. If you would like to to know whether we have collected personal 
          information about you, please provide us with the activities that you 
          participated in on the Site which requested personal information. After 
          we have reviewed the relevant databases, we will confirm whether we 
          have collected such information about you. Prior to changing or deleting 
          such infromation, we require that you provide us with proof of your 
          name and address, such as a valid driver's license. Once we have received 
          such proof and determined that it is satisfactory, we will immediately 
          delete or modify your information in our database and refrain from collecting 
          any other personally identifiable information from you, if you so request. 
          However, there may be residual information that will remain within our 
          databases that may or may not contain personally identifiable information. 
          This residual information will not be given to any other third party 
          or used for any commercial purpose.<br>
          <br>
          <b>SECURITY AND INTEGRITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</b></p>
        <p>Zondervan has established and maintains reasonable procedures to protect 
          the confidentiality, security and integrity of personal information 
          collected by this Site.</p>
        <p><b>II. ADDITIONAL POLICIES THAT APPLY TO CHILDREN UNDER 13</b></p>
        <p><b>KIDS AND INTERNET SAFETY</b></p>
        <p>We at Zondervan understand that the Internet presents an opportunity 
          for us to reach the public in new and exciting ways with information 
          about our programming, fun games, exciting sweepstakes and contests, 
          email, chat rooms, bulletin boards, and other forms of interactivity. 
          Zondervan also recognizes the privacy concerns of parents, and the importance 
          of protecting the privacy of the information this Site collects from 
          children. Parents of children who visit this Site can be confident that 
          any personal information that may be provided to this Site will be collected 
          and maintained in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection 
          Act ("COPPA"). Zondervan encourages parents to supervise their 
          children's activities online and to participate with their children's 
          online activities whenever possible. However, we understand that parents 
          may not always be able to supervise their children's activities on the 
          Internet. That's why Zondervan has developed a Site that parents can 
          feel is safe for their children and kids will find cool, informative, 
          educational, and fun! Because there's always room for improvement, Zondervan 
          welcomes any suggestions on how to make the Site a better, safer place 
          to hang out.</p>
        <p><b>COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN 
          UNDER 13</b></p>
        <p><br>
          When a visitor to our Site is under the age of 13, Zondervan does not 
          require the disclosure of more personally identifiable information than 
          is reasonably necessary for him or her to participate in an activity 
          as a condition of such participation. </p>
        <p>Zondervan may use different types of personally identifiable information 
          submitted to this Site by children under 13 in a variety of ways, which 
          are described below. In each instance, we comply with the parental consent 
          requirements of COPPA.</p>
        <p><b>A. Use of a Child's Information by Zondervan</b></p>
        <p>· We may collect a child's email address in connection with 
          a contest, sweepstakes or game for the sole purpose of communicating 
          with the child on a one-time-only basis (i.e., to contact a contest 
          winner). This information will not be used to re-contact the child, 
          and will be deleted from our records when the contest or game is over. 
          Parental consent will be obtained before we send the winner a prize.</p>
        <p>· We may collect a child's email address in order to respond 
          more than once to a child's specific request. For example, the child 
          may want to subscribe to an online newsletter or receive other online 
          communications from Zondervan. In these instances Zondervan will also 
          obtain a parent's email address along with the child's. Before any further 
          contact with the child, Zondervan will send an email to the parent (a) 
          notifying him or her we have collected the child's email address in 
          order to respond more than once to the child's request for a subscription, 
          information, etc; (b) informing the parent that he or she can refuse 
          us permission to contact the child, and how to do so; and (c) informing 
          the parent that if he or she does not respond to the email within 72 
          hours, Zondervan may use the child's information for the purpose for 
          which it was submitted.</p>
        <p>· We may collect a child's personally identifiable information 
          (including name, email address, mailing address and phone number) for 
          such activities as chats, forums, surveys, games, guestbooks, bulletin 
          boards, requests for suggestions, subscription registrations, content 
          submissions, requests for products or services, or requests for additional 
          information. In these instances we will initially collect only the child's 
          name and online contact information and the email address of the child's 
          parent. Before using this information for any purpose, we will send 
          the parent an email that (a) informs the parent that we wish to collect 
          and use the child's personal information and need the parent's consent 
          to do so, and (b) provides the parent with a link to access to this 
          Privacy Policy, which describes our information collection and use policies 
          as required by COPPA. If the proposed use of the child's personal information 
          does not involve disclosure to a third party, then Zondervan will ask 
          the parent to provide consent by return email. Upon receipt of the email 
          consent, we will send the parent a confirming email. If the proposed 
          use of the child's personal information involves disclosure to third 
          parties, the email we send to the parent will ask the parent either 
          to (i) return by postal mail or fax a consent form that will be attached 
          to the email, or (ii) call a toll free number where consent can be given 
          over the phone. If parental consent is not obtained by one of these 
          methods within one week Zondervan will delete all of the child's and 
          parent's personally identifiable information from its records. In addition, 
          parents can revoke a prior consent at any time.</p>
        <p>· We may collect a child's name and email address to the extent 
          reasonably necessary to protect the security of this Site, to protect 
          against liability or as required or permitted by law. Information collected 
          for these reasons will not be used for any other purpose.</p>
        <p>B. Sharing Children's Personal Information With Third Parties. Zondervan 
          may share a child's personal information with other News Corp. affiliates 
          who may send you information about their products or services. These 
          third parties have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security 
          and integrity of the personal information they obtain from Zondervan. 
          As noted above, parents may exercise their option not to consent to 
          the disclosure of their child's personal information to third parties. 
          Parents may consent to Zondervan's collection and use of a child's personal 
          information without consenting to the disclosure of the information 
          to third parties. </p>
        <p><b>LINKS/CO-BRANDED SITES</b></p>
        <p>As noted in Section I of this Privacy Policy, this Site may link directly 
          to sites operated by Zondervan advertisers, business partners and affiliated 
          companies. Those sites, which are not controlled by Zondervan may collect 
          personal information from your child. Parents should therefore check 
          the relevant site's privacy policy to understand how it collects and 
          uses children's personal information. Zondervan will not share in any 
          personal information obtained by a site from a child under the age of 
          13 unless that site follows the requirements of COPPA.</p>
        <p><b>REVIEWING AND MAKING CHANGES TO PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION 
          COLLECTED FROM CHILDREN UNDER 13</b></p>
        <p>Parents of children under age 13 may review or delete personal information 
          about their children from our records at any time. If you would like 
          to know the types of personal information we collect, please contact 
          us at <a href="mailto:zpub@zph.com">zpub@zph.com</a> or write to us 
          at Zondervan Publishing House Attn: Internet Team, 5300 Patterson SE, 
          Grand Rapids, MI 49530. If you would like to to know whether we have 
          collected personal information about your child, please provide us with 
          the activities that he or she participated in on the Site which requested 
          personal information. After we have reviewed the relevant databases, 
          we will confirm whether we have collected such information about your 
          child. Prior to changing or deleting such infromation, we require that 
          you provide us with proof of your name and address, such as a valid 
          driver's license, and proof that your child resides with you or is otherwise 
          in your custody. Once we have received such proof and determined that 
          it is satisfactory, we will immediately delete or modify your child's 
          information in our database and refrain from collecting any other personally 
          identifiable information from your child, if you so request. However, 
          there may be residual information that will remain within our databases 
          that may or may not contain personally identifiable information. This 
          residual information will not be given to any other third party or used 
          for any commercial purpose.<br>
