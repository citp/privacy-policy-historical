</p><p class="none"></p><p>Zondervan is part of the 
              News America Group, which has adopted a set of <a href="http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html">Privacy 
              Principles</a> applicable to all its U.S.-based companies. Zondervan 
              has implemented those Principles in this Privacy Policy, which describes 
              how we collect, use and share personally identifiable information 
              (“PII”) we obtain from and about individuals located in 
              the U.S. </p>
            <h2>Children's Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>Some of our online activities are directed to children under 13. 
              In those instances, we provide additional privacy protections. To 
              read about our protections for children under 13 <a href="http://www.zondervan.com/desk/privacykids.asp">click 
              here</a>.</p>
            <p>From time to time Zondervan may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect 
              changes in the law, technology or industry initiatives. Therefore, 
              you should review it periodically so that you are up to date on 
              our most current policies and practices.</p>
            <h2>Collection: <br>
              <span class="label">Collection of Personally Identifiable Information 
              (“PII”) By Zondervan</span></h2>
            <p> <b>General.</b> Zondervan collects personally identifiable information 
              (“PII”; that is, information such as your full name, email 
              address, mailing address or telephone number) only in order to create 
              or enhance our relationship with you. When we collect PII from you 
              it is because you are voluntarily submitting the information to 
              us in order to participate in activities like sweepstakes, contests, 
              games, surveys, forums, subscription registrations, content or suggestions 
              you submit to us, chats or bulletin boards, or because you want 
              us to furnish you with products, services or information. On those 
              occasions when we obtain PII from a third party, we use only reputable 
              sources of such information.</p>
            <p> <b>Cookies.</b>  </p><p>Cookies are small bits of information that the operators of Internet sites place on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies remember information about your activities on the site and enable the operator of the site to make your visits to our web sites more enjoyable.</p>
<p>
At this time, Zondervan employs cookies to keep track of your online session for personalization functionality, such as storing your password for easy logon. In the future, we plan to use cookies in a variety of ways, including relating your use of our site to your PII, so that, if you ask us to send you information about our upcoming products or promotions, the cookie information will allow us to limit the material we send you to the types of items you had viewed on our site in the past. However, if we wish to coordinate personal and cookie information in this manner, we will obtain your express prior consent (i.e., "opt in"). Also, our cookies will not contain PII.</p>
<p>
You can always program your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely.</p>
<h2>Notice: <br>
              <span class="label">Zondervan Will Provide You With Notice About 
              Its PII Collection Practices</span></h2>
            <p>When Zondervan collects PII from you, we will make sure you are 
              informed about who is collecting the information, how and why the 
              information is being collected and the types of uses we will make 
              of the information. </p>
            <p>This Policy describes the types of other companies that may want 
              to send you information about their products and services and therefore 
              want to share your personal information (See “Use” below). 
              However, at the time your PII is collected, Zondervan will notify 
              you of your options regarding our use of your personally identifiable 
              information, including whether we can share it with outside companies 
              (See “Choice” below). </p>
            <p>Sometimes we collect personally identifiable information from consumers 
              in manual format, such as a post card or subscription form. Providing 
              detailed notice in those situations often proves impractical, so 
              consumers will instead be provided with a short notice that describes 
              how to obtain the full text of this Policy and other relevant information 
              from us.</p>
            <p>Zondervan's web sites may be linked to Internet sites operated 
              by other companies. Some of these third party sites may be co-branded 
              with a Zondervan logo, even though they are not operated or maintained 
              by Zondervan, such as web sites owned and operated by our authors. 
              Zondervan's web sites may also carry advertisements from other companies. 
              Although we choose our business partners and advertisers carefully, 
              Zondervan is not responsible for the privacy practices of web sites 
              operated by third parties that are linked to our sites or for the 
              privacy practices of third parties that advertise on our web sites. 
              Once you've left a Zondervan web site via such a link or by clicking 
              on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy 
              of the third party to determine how they will handle any PII they 
              collect from you.</p>
            <p>Zondervan's web sites may also be linked to sites operated by companies 
              affiliated with Zondervan. Visitors to those affiliated sites should 
              still refer to their separate privacy policies and practices, which 
              may differ in some respects from this Policy.</p>
            <h2>Choice: <br>
              <span class="label">Zondervan Will Provide You With Choices About 
              The Use Of Your PII</span></h2>
            <p>Zondervan will provide you with the opportunity to choose whether 
              your PII may be used for purposes different from the purpose for 
              which it was submitted. You will also be able to choose whether 
              your information is shared with companies that are not affiliated 
              with Zondervan (i.e., not part of the News America Group).</p>
            <h2>Use: <br>
              <span class="label">Zondervan's Use of PII</span></h2>
            <p>Zondervan will use your PII in a manner that is consistent with 
              this Policy and only for the purpose for which it is submitted, 
              unless other uses are disclosed at the time of collection and you 
              allow us to use your information in these other ways. </p>
            <p>Zondervan may share your PII with companies that are affiliated 
              with us, that is part of the News America Group of companies. We 
              may also share your PII with companies that are not affiliated with 
              Zondervan but would like to send you information about their products 
              and services. For example, Zondervan may offer a sweepstakes or 
              contest in conjunction with a co-sponsor, and the co-sponsor may 
              send you information concerning its products or services. However, 
              you will always have the opportunity to instruct us not to share 
              your information with third parties.</p>
            <p>Zondervan's employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate 
              business reason to obtain access to your PII. Outside contractors 
              or agents who help us manage our information activities (i.e., sweepstakes 
              administration, order fulfillment, statistical analyses) may only 
              use PII to provide Zondervan with a specific service and not for 
              any other purpose.</p>
            <p>If Zondervan obtains PII from a third party, such as a business 
              partner, our use of this information is governed by this Policy.</p>
            <p>Zondervan may be required to disclose PII to comply with legal 
              requirements, such as a court order, and to protect the safety and 
              security of visitors to our web sites.</p>
            <h2>Security: <br>
              <span class="label">Zondervan Protects the Security of PII</span></h2>
            <p>Zondervan uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel 
              and physical measures to safeguard PII in its possession against 
              loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. In 
              addition, we use reasonable methods to make sure that PII is accurate, 
              up-to-date and appropriately complete.</p>
            <h2>Access: <br>
              <span class="label">How To Access, Correct or Delete Your PII</span></h2>
            <p>You may review or delete PII about you from our records at anytime. 
              If you would like to know the types of information that Zondervan 
              collects from visitors to its web sites, please send your request

              you, please send us the activities that you participated in on our 
              web sites that requested PII. After reviewing the relevant databases, 
              we will confirm whether we have collected such information about 
              you.</p>
            <p>Prior to changing or deleting any information about you, Zondervan 
              requires that you provide proof of your name and address, such as

              provided is satisfactory, we will immediately delete or modify the 
              information and/or and refrain from collecting PII about you in 
              the future, if you so request. However, there may be residual information 
              that will remain within our databases that may or may not contain 
              PII. This residual information will not be given to any third party 
              or used for any commercial purpose.</p>
