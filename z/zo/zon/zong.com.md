We use this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest. 

#### For end-users

There is no need for you to register phone numbers for our payment service as these numbers are already pre-registered with the mobile network operators. When you choose to make a payment, you insert your phone number on the payment console and ZONG may send you a payment confirmation via the wireless network you have subscribed to. 

###  Service-related Announcements

We will send developers and publishers strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account. 

### Newsletters

If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter, we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe. Please see the “Choice and Opt-out” section. 

###  Agents/Service Providers 

We use other third parties such as an email service provider to send out emails on our behalf and an online survey provider to conduct anonymous surveys on our site. When you sign up for our newsletter or participate in our surveys, we will share your email as necessary for the third party to provide that service. These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for promotional purposes. 

###  Customer Service 

Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password.

### General and access

ZONG may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena.

### Disclosing

ZONG reserves the right to access and disclose your Personal Information to comply with laws, subpoena and lawful government requests, to operate its systems properly, to protect other ZONG users or third parties.

Now and in the future, there are subsidiaries, joint ventures, and one or more parent companies whom we control, who control us, or with whom we are under common control (collectively, “Affiliates”). We may share some or all of your personal information with these Affiliates for their business purposes and as required or permitted by law.

### Information Protection

ZONG protect Personal Information received by establishing appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. This helps prevent unauthorized access, maintains data accuracy and ensures that the information is used correctly.

The security of your personal information is important to us.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

### Cookies 

A cookie is a piece of information that is deposited by the ZONG computer server when you visit ZONG Web site which is stored on your computer's hard drive by your web browser. On revisiting ZONG Web site, the ZONG' server will recognize the cookies, giving ZONG information about your last visit. At your option, we link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site so as to enhance your experience. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file. 

At your option, we set a persistent cookie to store your mobile numbers which allows our application to pre-fill your mobile number so that you do not have to enter it in future sessions. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but usually you can alter the settings of your browser to prevent automatic acceptance. 

### IP addresses 

Every time you connect to ZONG's Web site, web server logs will be stored which show your IP address (the unique number which your machine uses when it is connected to the Internet); what you looked at; whether the page request was successful or not, and which browser you used to view the pages. The use of this data is strictly for statistical purposes and personalization purposes only. This helps ZONG understand where you come from, which areas of the site are of particular interest and also which pages are not being requested. We link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information. IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information to help combat fraud, improve security and provide localized content and instructions in the language native to that country. 

We use a third-party tracking service that uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate. These services track traffic volume and site statistics that are not linked to personally identifiable information. The use of cookies by our tracking utility company and other trusted partners is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies. 

### Choice and Opt-out

We will not share, sell, rent or trade your personal information in ways incompatible with the ones described above without providing you a choice. We provide you the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us at privacy@zong.com.
