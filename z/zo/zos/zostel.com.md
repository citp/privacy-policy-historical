# Zostel | Privacy Policy

Privacy policy is required by the law and this policy only applies to Zostel and not to the websites of other companies, individuals or organisations to whom we provide links to our websites.

### Use of Your Information

We collect your information for the safety of our guests, and to understand who we are accommodating at our properties, for the safety of our staff. In addition, website user and guest data is collected for statistical purposes. We also collect our guests’ nationality, date of birth, gender, for statistical analysis purposes. When you visit our websites, we may automatically log your IP address (the unique address which identifies your computer on the internet). We use IP addresses to help us manage our websites and to collect broad demographic information for analytical use. For reservations, we send guests confirmation emails and will therefore require your email address. Exceptions may occur in the case of us needing to contact previous guests in relation to post or lost property. 

### Reservation Data

In order for us to confirm a reservation for you, we do require some information. This will usually consist of:  
Your name  
Telephone or mobile number – in case of an emergency  
Gender  
Nationality  
Date of Birth  
Identification data i.e. Passport, Driving License details  
Credit card details, including the three-digit code that appears on the back of your credit card  
Date of arrival and departure  
Email address  
Upon arrival, we will require the same information from your fellow travellers, please ensure they are all aware of this to ensure a quick and efficient check-in. 

### Credit Card Data

In order to guarantee reservations via all channels (telephone, website or smartphone application, but not restricted to), we require a full 16 digit debit/credit card number, name on the card, card type (we accept VISA, Master card or Maestro), three digit security code and the expiry date. Your debit/credit card details are only used to secure your booking and Zostel will only debit the account if you do not follow our cancellation procedure. Reservations that are cancelled at least 24 hours prior to arrival are not charged for, whereas no shows or failing to cancel in excess of 24 hours will incur a charge for the first night. Zostel indemnifies itself against all data use on and reservations made via third party websites/agents. Please refer to their relevant privacy policy and terms and conditions. Guests' Personal Data Zostel respects guest privacy and will not sell or disclose guests’ personal information to any other person, business or third party unless in the case of an emergency and/or it is seen as part of our duty of care. 

### Keeping Guests' Information Updated

As an accommodation and leisure provider, we have guests returning to our properties on a regular basis. It is your duty to inform us if any of your personal information, which we hold about you, needs to be updated. We may contact you at any time, if you have booked accommodation with us and we suspect we hold false information about you. 

### Website Security

The Internet is not a secure medium. However, we have put in place various security procedures, including firewalls that are used to block unauthorized traffic to our website. 

### Third Party Websites

Our website contains links to many other websites promoting their business and needs to our guests. Zostel indemnifies itself against all data use on and reservations made via third party websites/agents. Please refer to their relevant privacy policy and terms and conditions. 

### Photography and Film

No permission is needed to take photos or film at our properties. However, we do recommend asking for permission before photographing or filming other guests who are not part of your group. Verbal consent is solicited as a goodwill gesture. On occasions we may commission crews to film or take photographs at our properties for promotional purposes. If you do not wish to be filmed or photographed, you are required to voluntarily leave the filming or photography area. 

### Disclosing Guests' Personal Information to Third Parties

Other than that for the purposes referred to in this policy, we will not disclose any personal information without your permission unless we are legally obliged to do so (for example, if required to do so by court order or for the purposes of prevention of fraud). 

### Your Rights

By submitting your information to us, you consent to the use of that information as set out in this Privacy Policy. You may request at any time that we provide you with the personal information we hold about you. You may also choose to add, modify or delete information about you stored with us. Provision of such information will be subject to proving your identity and full address with a utility bill and acceptable photo ID. For any such requests, please reach out to us on [privacy@zostel.com](mailto:privacy@zostel.com).   
You also have the right to lodge a complaint with an EU supervisory authority in case of discrepancies, however, we do hope you would give us chance to rectify it first by reaching out to us on privacy@zostel.com. 

### Changes to Our Privacy Policy

We may change our Privacy Policy at any time. Continued use of our website signifies that you agree to any such changes.
