# Privacy Policy | Zostel

Privacy policy is required by the law and this policy only applies to Zostel and not to the websites of other companies, individuals or organisations to whom we provide links to our websites.

**USE OF YOUR INFORMATION**

We collect your information for the safety of our guests and to understand who we are accommodating at our properties for the safety of our staff. In addition, website user and guest data is collected for statistical purposes.

We also collect our guests’ nationality, date of birth, gender, for statistical analysis purposes.

When you visit our websites, we may automatically log your IP address (the unique address which identifies your computer on the internet). We use IP addresses to help us manage our websites and to collect broad demographic information for analytics use.

For reservations, we send guests confirmation emails and will therefore require your email address.

Exceptions may occur in the case of us needing to contact previous guests in relation to post or lost property.

**RESERVATION DATA**

In order for us to confirm a reservation for you, we do require some information. This will usually consist of:

  * Your name
  * Telephone or mobile number – in case of an emergency
  * Gender
  * Nationality
  * Date of Birth
  * Identification data i.e. Passport, Driving License details
  * Credit card details, including the three-digit code that appears on the back of your credit card
  * Date of arrival and departure
  * Email address



Upon arrival we will require the same information from your fellow travellers, please ensure they are all aware of this to ensure a quick and efficient check-in.

**CREDIT CARD DATA**

In order to guarantee reservations via all channels (telephone, website or smartphone application, but not restricted to), we require a full 16 digit debit/credit card number, name on the card, card type (we accept VISA, Master card or Maestro), three digit security code and the expiry date.

Your debit/credit card details are only used to secure your booking and Zostel will only debit the account if you do not follow our cancellation procedure. Reservations that are cancelled at least 24 hours prior to arrival are not charged for, whereas no shows or failing to cancel in excess of 24 hours will incur a charge for the first night.

Zostel indemnifies itself against all data use on and reservations made via third party websites/agents. Please refer to their relevant privacy policy and terms and conditions.

**GUEST PERSONAL DATA**

Zostel respects guest privacy and will not sell or disclose guests’ personal information to any other person, business or third party unless in the case of an emergency and/or it is seen as part of our duty of care.

**KEEPING OUR DATA UP-TO-DATE**

As an accommodation and leisure provider, we have guests returning to our properties on a regular basis. It is your duty to inform us if any of your personal information which we hold about you needs to be updated. We may contact you at any time if you have booked accommodation with us and we suspect we hold false information about you.
