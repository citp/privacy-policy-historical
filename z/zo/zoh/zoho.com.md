# ZOHO - The Premier Online Hospitality Marketplace

This privacy policy may be updated from time to time and is incorporated in the Terms of Use for the Zoho Online Hospitality Marketplace.

Note: The Zoho Marketplace is a business-to-business service and is directed to individuals acting on behalf of the companies they work for. 

Zoho Corporation is committed to the privacy and security of individuals using our Online Hospitality Marketplace (the "Marketplace") and wants to provide you with the best possible online experience. To that end, we want you to understand what kinds of information we gather from you, how this information is used and safeguarded, and how you can control its use. 

This privacy policy addresses the following issues:

**What information is collected from me?**  
In order to browse the Marketplace or buy or sell products and services in the Marketplace on behalf of your company, you will need to register and will be asked to provide personally identifiable information ("personal information"). To register as a buyer or seller, you will be asked for identifying information including your real name, email address, work phone number, position, and your company's address. 

In addition to the information you choose to submit, our systems are set up to gather certain anonymous data to help us understand better how our sites are being used and how we can improve them. This automatically gathered data includes your computer's IP or "Internet Protocol" address, statistics about how visitors navigate through our sites, and information provided through the use of "cookies" (which are described in more detail below).

**How is my information used?**  
Cookies: These are small files that we send to and store on your computer so that we may recognize it as a unique machine the next time you visit our sites. Our cookies are used for three reasons: (1) to keep track of your information for your own convenience such as in your shopping cart; (2) to help us optimize your online experience by altering our content depending on your position or company and to provide you with information more likely to be relevant to you; and (3) to help us understand the size of our audience and their traffic patterns within our network. Some of our features, such as the shopping cart, depend on the use of cookies. Therefore, if you are a purchaser you must ensure that your browser will accept cookies.

Registration: The information you provide when you become a registered user of one of our sites is used to facilitate your buying or selling activities on behalf of you company and to send you administrative notices about your account or our services. If you submit an order for a product your name will be provided to the seller as the contact at your company for that order. Unless you specify that you'd prefer not to hear from us, we may also use the email address you provide at registration to contact you for promotional or other reasons. If you indicate that you're interested in hearing from other companies, we may also share your contact information for that purpose. To opt-out from these promotional mailings, see the section below, "What choices do I have regarding the use of my information."

Automatically Gathered Data: The information gathered automatically by our system -- such as your computer's IP address, the kind of browser you're using, and a record of your navigation through our site -- may be used by Zoho for various purposes and in particular so we can understand how to make our sites convenient and useful to our audience.
