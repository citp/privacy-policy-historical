## Overview

This page states the Privacy Policy applicable to this website which is hosted and operated by Zmags, Inc. (herein referred to as the “Website”). Please read this page carefully. As used herein, the words “user,” “you” and “your” mean users of the Website and the words “we,” “our,” and “Zmags” mean Zmags, Inc., the owner and operator of the Website. 

Zmags operates the Zmags service and related services, applications, domains and networks offered by Zmags (“Zmags Service”). Zmags’s Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how we collect, use and share the personal information and help you make informed decisions when using the Zmags Service. By using or accessing the Zmags Service, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. 

This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information you may provide to us, or that we may collect, offline and/or through other means (for example, at a live event, via telephone, or through the mail). 

## Collection and Use of Personal Information

If you visit the Website, we do not collect any personally identifiable information about you (such as your name, address, phone number or email address) unless you provide it. You must provide personal information in order to use certain optional features of the Website, including, but not limited to, sending e-mails, signing up for newsletters. We will, and by your use of these optional features you expressly authorize us to, use the information you provide in order to execute these optional features. 

We will not disclose any personal information to a third party without your express prior written authorization. Unless you explicitly ask us to or as disclosed when you sign up for an optional feature, we will not share any personal information that you provide with any third party or use the information for any purpose other than to provide the specific feature that you request. 

## Collection and Use of Non-personal Information

We collect and store non-personally identifiable (anonymous) information about you that is generated automatically as you navigate through the Website, such as your ZIP Code, City, State; your IP address (a unique number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web); your domain type (i.e., .com, .net, .edu, etc.); browser type, operating system, browser language, service provider; the content and pages that you access on the Zmags Service, and the dates and times of your visit.

We create “aggregate data” reports that we may disclose to third parties, including our clients with whom we have entered into an agreement to provide such information. We may also study aggregate data in order to enhance our existing services or develop new services. 

Additionally, we may use non-personally identifiable information about your visit to this Website to enable us or a third party to provide you with information while you are using this Website or other websites about products and services. 

Also, we use third-party advertising companies and advertising networks to serve ads to you on our behalf when you visit our Web site. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. 

We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our terms of use or to protect our service, site, customers, or other individuals. 

## Use of Browser-based Cookies and Web Beacons

Zmags uses browser based cookies and flash shared objects, which are small text files placed on your computer’s hard drive, and web beacons (also known as pixel tags), which are electronic images embedded into a web page, on the Website. Cookies, shared objects and web beacons are used for record keeping, to track your movements when you visit the Website and to help us determine what type of information to present to you. The use of cookies, shared objects and web beacons is an industry standard – you’ll find them used at most Web sites. Our cookies, shared objects and web beacons do not contain any personally identifiable information about you, and do not damage or alter your system files in any way. The first time you visit the Website, Zmags assigns you a unique, anonymous ID, which is stored in the cookie and/or shared object on your computer. You can set your browser to refuse cookies from the Zmags Service if you choose. 

## Zmags Uses of Information:

The information we collect about you in the course of our relationship is used to provide the Zmags Service to you. For example, as we endeavor to protect your identity, we may use your demographic information to create a database of user profiles, select services based on your information and for marketing analysis. In addition, we look at technical information to diagnose problems with our systems, to administer the Zmags Service, and to enhance the services we provide to you. We may use your information to track user-generated content and users to the extent necessary to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. We will use your email address, without further consent, for administrative communications such as notifying you of major updates, for customer service purposes, to address copyright infringement or defamation issues, or to contact you regarding any content that you have posted to or downloaded from the Zmags Service.

Zmags uses all of the information that we collect to understand the usage trends and preferences of our users, to improve the way the Zmags Service works and looks, and to create new features and functionality. Zmags may use “automatically collected” information, “cookies”, and Flash objects to: (a) automatically update the Zmags Service service; (b) remember your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you access the Zmags Service; (c) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages accessed; and (d) track your entries, submissions, participation and status in any promotions or other activities, and usage of the Zmags Service.

## With Whom Your Information May be Shared

Zmags does not sell, trade or rent your personally identifiable information to others. Zmags does share non-personally identifiable information. We may provide information to others as follows. (a) As discussed above under “Collection and use of non-personal information,” we may provide aggregate statistics about our users, traffic patterns and related site information and non-personally identifiable information to our clients or for other marketing and promotional purposes, including providing you with information about products and services. (b) We may share information, including your email address if you provide it to us, to our affiliates or retailer for whom we have created co-branded or private label versions of the Website. We however will not share any mobile phone numbers, if provided to us for the purposes of sending you one-time mobile text (SMS) alerts, with our affiliates or retailers. (c) We may provide information to third parties to the extent necessary to enable them to provide services on the Website, such as delivery or tracking of content, or to provide information or services requested by you. 

Please be aware that 1) any personally identifiable information that you voluntarily choose to display on the Zmags Service becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by others without restriction; and 2) as a feature of the Zmags Service, other users may become aware of your behavior or document viewing activities to their own profile pages and may use this information without restriction; provided that you will have the ability to opt out of this feature at anytime.

## Changing or Deleting Your Information:

You have the ability and control to remove or alter your account-specific information, including any user profile data that you provide to the Zmags Service at any time. Access and control over most user-provided personal information on the Zmags Service is readily available through the edit function on your profile. As a user of the Zmags Service, you may modify or remove any of your profile information at any time by logging into your account. Information will be updated promptly. If you wish to deactivate your Zmags Service account, you may do so. Removed information such as your user ID, geographical information connected to your user ID, and any documents that you have uploaded to the Zmags Service may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time, and thus may continue to be publicly available across features of the Zmags Service such as its search engine, but will not be generally accessible by Zmags or users of the Zmags service.

## Data Security:

Zmags has implemented generally accepted standards of technology security in order to protect information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction.

## Children Under 13:

Zmags complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register, publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information through the Website. Because we do not collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 via the Website, we do NOT condition the participation of a child under 13 in the Website’s online activities on providing personally identifiable information. If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information to or on the Zmags Service. If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has become a member of the Zmags Service, then please contact Zmags at [privacy@Zmags.com](mailto:privacy@Zmags.com) to have that child's account terminated and information deleted.

## Changes in Corporate Structure:

In the event that Zmags is acquired by or merged with a third-party entity, or undergoes a change of control or any form of sale or transfer of some or all of its assets, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from users as part of that merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. However, we will take steps to assure that any personal information is used in a manner consistent with the Zmags privacy policy under which it was collected.

## Changes and Updates to this Privacy Notice:

All versions of this privacy policy are dated with the effective date (the date on which the policy was posted to this Website). Zmags will only use the information we learn about you in the manner described in the Privacy Policy in effect when the information was collected from you.
