      <h1 class="content-h">Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>
        Your privacy is important to you and to us.  We recognize that we must earn and keep your trust.  This Privacy Policy outlines the types of personal information we gather when you use Zvents, as well as some of the steps we take to safeguard it. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The following principles apply to the personally identifying information we ask for and that you provide. "Personally identifying information" is information that individually identifies you, such as your name, physical address or email address.
      </p>
      <h1>Data Collection</h1>
      <p>
        Performing a Zvents search does not require any personally identifying information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Zvents collects limited non-personally identifying information your browser makes available whenever you visit a website. This log information includes your Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your query and cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. We use this information to operate, develop and improve our services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of our services require you to register for an account. Zvents asks you for some personal information in order to create an account (typically your name, email address, zip code, and a password for your account) and we will use that information to provide the service.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we require personally identifying information, we will inform you about the types of information we collect and how we use it. We hope this will help you make an informed decision about sharing your personal information with us.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to personally identifying information you provide at registration or by using the service, we collect the following information:
      </p>
      <p>
        Content. When you create an event, venue, or group, post comments or photos, that content becomes public. The public will see any information that you include in your content, and as such, Zvents has no control over how this information will be used. For that reason, please think carefully about what personally identifiable information you disclose in your content.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also collect anonymous information, such as your IP address, the type of browser you use, the pages on our site that you visit, the search terms that you enter and the advertisements that you click. This information is used to provide features and help us diagnose problems, administer the site and otherwise improve our service to you.
      </p>
      <h1>Cookies</h1>
      <p>
        Zvents uses cookies to track specific user sessions on the web site.  This lets us provide user-specific functionality without asking you to re-enter your user name on every single page.  Our cookies contain only a small, anonymous piece of identifying information called a session id (like a random number) that we map back to your account while you are on the site.  Cookies contains no other information.
      </p>
      <h1>Information Sharing</h1>
      <p>
        We do not rent or sell your personally identifying information to other companies or individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will only divulge your personal information if we are required to do so by law or have a good faith belief that disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of Zvents, its users or the public.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may store and process personal information collected on our site in the United States or any other country in which Zvents Inc. or its agents maintain facilities. By using our services, you consent to the transfer of your information among these facilities, including those located outside your country.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the event of a transfer of ownership of Zvents Inc., such as acquisition by or merger with another company, we will provide notice before any personally identifying information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may share aggregated information with others. Examples of this include the number of users who searched for "San Francisco Giants" or how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. This aggregated information contains nothing that is personally trackable to you.
      </p>
      <h1>Information Security</h1>
      <p>
        We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data.
      </p>
      <p>
        We restrict access to your personally identifying information to employees who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Zvents uses physical, electronic and administrative safeguards, including firewall and password protection for our servers, designed to protect the security of data.  While Zvents does implement commercially reasonable measures to protect information, Zvents cannot guarantee that data transmission over the Internet or information storage technology will be 100% secure.
      </p>
      <h1>Links</h1>
      <p>
        This web site may contain links to other websites. Please be aware that Zvents is not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our web site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The sites displayed as search results or linked to by Zvents' services are developed by people over whom Zvents exercises no control. These other sites may place their own cookies on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Zvents may present links in a format that enables us to understand whether they have been followed. We use this information to understand and improve the quality of Zvents' search technology. For instance, this data helps us determine how often users are satisfied with the first result of a query and how often they proceed to later results. 
      </p>
      <h1>Changes to this Policy</h1>
      <p>
        Please note this Privacy Policy may change from time to time.  We will always announce any change in advance.  If you have any questions about this privacy statement, you can <a href="/support/contact?issues=">contact us</a>.
