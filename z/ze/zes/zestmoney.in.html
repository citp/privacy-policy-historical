                <p>"Zest" is a trading name of Chalk Farm Ventures Private Limited (referred to, including its affiliates, as "we" or "us"). We are the data controller. Throughout this Privacy Policy "you" means the customer.</p>

                <p>We believe you deserve the utmost respect when it comes to the security and use of your personal information, so we have described how we look after your information as clearly as possible.</p>

                <p>Our Privacy Policy applies from when you register with us. Our Privacy Policy is regularly reviewed to make sure that we continue to serve your privacy interests. We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy and these changes will be posted on our website. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. We are committed to keeping your personal information confidential and will only give it to others for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>
