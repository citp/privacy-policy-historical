            <p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information.  We automatically collect certain information when you visit our Site, such as Internet Protocol (IP) address (if using a browser), operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring site, and any device identifier (if using a mobile device).

            <p>We also automatically collect certain information through the use of "cookies" or web beacons.  These are small files that your browser places on your computer.

            <h2>Sharing and Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
            <p>In connection with performing the Service, we are required to disclose certain information to governmental taxing authorities in order to ensure that credit is made for tax withholding deposits. We also use your information (and the information you provide to us) to perform and provide you with the Service and to communicate with you. We will not share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies, unless we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:</p>
    
            <ul>
              <li>We may share any of the information we gather about you with third party agents and service providers to facilitate the operation of the Site and Service, to provide the Site and our Service or functions on our behalf and to perform related services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the Service's features, or to process credit card payments), or to assist us in analyzing how our Site and Service is used.  These third parties may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. </li>
              <li>We will cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law and will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect our property and rights or those of a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop any activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical or legally actionable. </li>
              <li>We may share aggregated information that does not include personal information and we may otherwise disclose such information with third parties for industry analysis, demographic and analytical profiling and other purposes.  Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your personal information. </li>
              We may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of our assets, which could include your personal information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy. 
            </ul>

            <h2>Changing or Deleting Your Information</h2>
            <p>You may review, update, correct or delete your personal information through your account or by contacting us.  If you completely delete all such information, then your account will become deactivated and you will not be able to access our Service through your account.  If you would like us to delete your record in our system, please contact us with a request that we delete your personal information from our database. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request, however, we may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for other legitimate business purposes.</p>

            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>We employ administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access, however, despite those efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.</p>

            <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
            <p>The Service may contain links to other sites.  Any information you provide on those sites is provided directly to the owner of that site and is subject to that party's privacy policy.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to such sites, and we are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of those sites.</p>

            <h2>Removal of Information from Children</h2>
            <p>The Service is not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.  If we learn that we have collected personal information of a child under 13, we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as possible.</p>

            <h2>Advertising Cookies</h2>
            <p>As you browse ZenPayroll, advertising cookies will be placed on your computer so that we can understand what you are interested in.  Our display advertising partner, AdRoll, then enables us to present you with retargeting advertising on other sites based on your previous interaction with ZenPayroll. The techniques our partners employ do not collect personal information such as your name, email address, postal address or telephone number.  You can visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" target="_blank">this page</a> to opt out of AdRoll and their partners' targeted advertising.</p>

            <h2>Changes</h2>
            <p>Any information that is collected is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected.  We may, however, modify and revise our Privacy Policy from time-to-time.  If we make any material changes to this policy, we will notify you of such changes by posting them on our site, through the Service or by sending you an email or other notification, and we will indicate when such changes will become effective.  By continuing to access or use our Service after those changes become effective, you are agreeing to be bound by the revised policy.</p>
