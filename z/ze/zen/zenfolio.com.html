    <h1>Privacy Statement</h1>

    <p>Please refer to the <strong>Definitions</strong> section set forth in the
        <a href="/z/terms">Zenfolio Website Terms and Conditions of Use</a> agreement.
    </p>
    <p>Your privacy is important to us so we will strive to keep Your information safe and secure.
        This privacy policy will explain the kind of information we collect about You and how we
        use it. By accessing and using the Website, you agree to our Privacy Policy as
        outlined below.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Information We Collect from You and How We Use It</h2>

    <p>The Website collects and stores the following information: Your name, email address,
        and display preferences. When subscribing for paid Services or placing e-commerce orders
        on our Website we may also collect Your name, billing address, telephone number, billing
        and credit card information, shipping addresses, and payment preferences. If you sign up to 
        receive marketing emails, we may contact you about our Services and promotions. Users who request
        payments to be made to them from products sold on Zenfolio may also need to provide their
        tax ID information for tax reporting purposes.  
    </p>
    <p>We may also collect IP addresses for administration and demographic purposes and may use 
    	this information to help identify fraudulent transactions. We do not, however, link IP 
    	addresses to your computer's User ID.  Additionally, we use third party analytic tools 
    	and reporting technologies to collect non-personal information such as operating system, 
    	browser software, Internet domain and host names, and activity on the Website.
    </p>
    <p>Zenfolio uses the information submitted by or collected from You to optimize the Website or
        services to better suit You, to process e-commerce orders or enable Photographers to process
        orders, and to protect against potentially fraudulent transactions.
    </p>
    
    <h2>We Use Cookies to Collect Information</h2>
    
    <p>Like almost all e-commerce web sites, we use "cookies." Cookies are bits of information 
		that are stored on your computer by your web browser. Although our cookies don't store any 
		of your personal information, they do allow us to provide you with a more personalized user 
		experience, to track your use of the Website, to analyze Website activity and to allow you 
		to login and begin use of the Website automatically when you visit. 
	</p>
	<p>Whether you want your web browser to accept cookies or not is up to you. The Help portion of 
		the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new 
		cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies 
		altogether. If you haven't changed your computer's settings, most likely your browser 
		already accepts cookies. You can also disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, 
		such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-ons settings or visiting the Web site of its 
		manufacturer. However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of features and 
		services, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block our cookies, 
		you will not be able to add items to your Cart, proceed to checkout, or use any services 
		that require you to sign in.
	</p>

    <h2>How We Protect Your Information</h2>

    <p>Zenfolio uses standard industry security practices to protect Your personal information
        including Secure Socket Layer (SSL) transmission technology for all sensitive information
        exchanges. This technology encrypts information You send us to avoid it being intercepted
        before reaching our secure HTTPS servers.
    </p>
    <p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted 
    	to us from unauthorized access or disclosure, both during transmission and once we receive it. 
    	However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% 
    	secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your 
    	personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We assume no liability for 
    	any disclosure of data due to errors in transmission, unauthorized third party access or other 
    	acts of third parties, or other acts or omissions.
    </p>
    
    <h2>When We Disclose Your Information to Third Parties</h2>
    
    <p>Under no circumstances do we rent, trade or share your e-mail address with any other company for 
    	their marketing purposes without your consent.  We may disclose the personal and non-personal 
    	information of our customers to any successor-in-interest of ours, such as a company that 
    	acquires our business. We may need to disclose your personal information when required by law 
    	or when we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a judicial 
    	proceeding, a court order or legal process. We may share your mailing address with select third 
    	parties.  Additionally, we contract with third party service providers who provide analytic 
    	tools and reporting technologies that may collect certain non-personal information via cookies, 
    	web beacons, or other types of tracking pixels.
    </p>
   
    <h2>Information You Disclose to Third Parties</h2>

    <p>Zenfolio assumes no responsibility for the disclosure of information of any subscriber or
        visitor to Photographers in the event an order is placed for fulfillment with Photographer.
        You specifically agree to hold Zenfolio harmless from any liability arising out of the use
        or misuse of any information submitted in the process of placing orders to be fulfilled by
        Photographers.
    </p>
    <p>Zenfolio does not control the privacy policies of any third-party sites linked to our
        Website. Zenfolio assumes no responsibility or liability for the actions of such third
        parties. It is Your responsibility to be informed of and be comfortable with the privacy
        policy of any third-party Website that You access. Zenfolio assumes no responsibility or
        liability for information that You voluntarily disclose in a public area or forum.
    </p>
    <p>In order to insure Your privacy, you must keep the secrecy of any password or personal
        information at all times. The ultimate responsibility for the protection of Your
        information rests with You.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Collected from Children</h2>

    <p>Zenfolio will not knowingly collect or use any personal information from children we know
        to be under the age of thirteen. In addition, once Zenfolio is notified that we are in
        possession of such information, we will delete any information in our databases that
        originates from a child under the age of thirteen.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Data Transfer and Storage</h2>

    <p>Zenfolio is a California corporation operated from within the United States. Accordingly, information 
    	collected by Zenfolio will be stored in the United States.  If you are accessing the Website from outside 
    	of the United States, you acknowledge and agree that your information will be received by or transferred to 
    	servers located within the United States.
    </p>

    <h2>Opting Out of Certain Communications</h2>

    <p>If you are no longer interested in receiving e-mail announcements and other marketing information from us, 
    	please e-mail your request to support@zenfolio.com. Please include your complete name, e-mail address and 
    	mailing address. Note that you may still receive transaction related communications from us.
    </p>

    <h2>Changing Your Personal Information</h2>

    <p>You have a right to access the personal information held about you.  You can obtain a copy of your personal 
    	information and request changes or deletion of your personal information and/or account by emailing us at 
    	support@zenfolio.com. For your protection, you may be required to provide proof of your identity before 
    	obtaining a copy of your personal information.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Changes to our Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>If we change our Privacy Policy, we will post a new version on our Website, which will become effective 
    when posted. The new policy will apply to all current and past users of the Website and will replace any 
    prior policies that are inconsistent with it.
