**What do we mean by Personal Information?**

In this Policy, personal information means information or an information set that identifies or could be used by or on behalf of Zendesk to identify an individual and includes Personal Data as such term is defined in our Terms of Service. Except as described in this Policy, Zendesk will not give, sell, rent or loan any personal information to any third party.

Personal information does not include Usage Data which we define as encoded or anonymized information or aggregated data that we may collect about a group or category of services, features or users which does not contain personally identifying information. Usage Data helps us understand trends in usage of the Service so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor the Service. In addition to collecting and using Usage Data ourselves, we may share Usage Data with third parties, including our customers, partners and service providers, for various purposes, including to help us better understand our customers’ needs and improve the Service as well as for advertising and marketing purposes.  We do not share Usage Data with third parties in a way that would enable them to identify you personally.

**How Do We Collect, Use and Share Your Personal Information and Other Information?**

_Information You Provide to Us_

When you register for the Service, we ask for personal information such as your name, address, phone number, e-mail address and credit card information, as well as certain related information like your company name and website name.  We also collect personal information such as an email address and a name or alias of any Agents or End-Users you authorize to log into and utilize the Service in connection with your Account and a password from these Agents when they first access the Service.  If you sign-up for a free trial account, you are not required to enter your credit card information unless and until you decide to continue with a paid subscription to the Service.  A third-party intermediary is used to manage credit card processing.  This intermediary is not permitted to store, retain, or use your billing information for any purpose except for credit card processing on Zendesk’s behalf.

Zendesk may use the personal information provided to operate the Service and tailor its customers’ needs, for billing, identification and authentication, to contact and communicate with you and your Agents about the Service and your and their use of the Service, send marketing materials (subject to your opt-out option), for research purposes, and to generally improve the content and functionality of the Service.

Zendesk may also share personal information with its third-party service providers (such as its credit card processors and hosting partners) to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and other services we use to operate the Service and maintain a high quality user experience. We do not permit our service providers to use the personal information that we share with them for their marketing purposes.

Some of our pages utilize framing techniques to serve content to/from our partners while preserving the look and feel of our site. Please be aware that you are providing your personal information to these third parties and not to Zendesk.

This information includes internet protocol addresses browser, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data as well as certain personal information such as user name, user email address and other information that may be included in open textual fields. We generally use this information as we would Usage Data to analyze trends, administer and maintain the Service, or track activity within the Service. Our application log files are subject to the same strict data security policies and procedures as the application databases for our Service.

We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or site functionality.

If customers wish to update or delete your testimonial, they can contact us at [privacy@zendesk.com](mailto:privacy@zendesk.com).

**Protection of Information**

Zendesk is committed to ensuring the security of your personal information. We utilize robust precautions to protect the confidentiality and security of the personal information within the Service, by employing technological, physical and administrative security safeguards, such as firewalls and carefully developed security procedures. For example, when you enter confidential information (such as login credentials or information submitted from within the Service) we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). These technologies, procedures and other measures are used in an effort to ensure that your data is safe, secure, and only available to you and to those you authorized to access your data. However, no internet, e-mail or other electronic transmission is ever fully secure or error free, so you should take care in deciding what information you send to us in this way.

**Safe Harbor Data Privacy Notice**

Zendesk has certified compliance with the U.S. – EU and U.S. – Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks for protecting the privacy of data flowing from the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland to the United States, as set forth by the US Department of Commerce. Zendesk and the other entities that comprise the Zendesk Group are committed to adherence to the principles set forth in these frameworks regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from EU member countries and Switzerland as well as related principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access and enforcement.

We frequently enter agreements with our customers located in the EEA to provide them access to our Service, which includes the processing of information relating their customers. In providing our Service, we do not own, control or direct the use of the information stored or processed on our platform at the direction of our customers, and in fact we are largely unaware of what information is being stored on our platform and only access such information as reasonably necessary to provide the Service (including to respond to support requests), as otherwise authorized by our customers or as required by law. We are the data processors and not the data controllers of the information on our platform for purposes of the EU Directive on Data Protection (Directive) and the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection. Our EEA or Switzerland based customers, who control their customer data and send it to Zendesk for processing, are the “controllers” of that data and are responsible for compliance with the Directive. In particular, Zendesk’s customers are responsible for complying with the Directive and relevant data protection legislation in the relevant EEA member state before sending personal information to Zendesk for processing. We work with our customers to help them provide notice to their customers concerning the purpose for which personal information is collected.

As the processors of personal information on behalf of our customers, we follow their instructions with respect to the information they control to the extent consistent with the functionality of our Service. In doing so, we implement technical, physical and administrative measures against unauthorized processing of such information and against loss, destruction of, or damage to, personal information as more fully described above under the section above entitled, “Protection of Information”.

**Hosting and Data Transfer**

Unless we expressly agree otherwise (including through our Terms of Service), we may host and process data, including personal information, in the United States and in other countries through the Zendesk Group and third parties that we use to operate and manage the Service. When you access or use the Service, or otherwise provide information to us, you are consenting, on behalf of you and your authorized Agents or End-Users, (and representing that you have the authority to provide such consent) to the processing and transfer of information in and to the United States and other countries which may have different privacy laws from your or their country of residence.

**Choice**

We process and store information on behalf of our customers.  Zendesk has no direct relationship with the individuals with whom our customers may interact using the Service.  If you are an individual interacting with a customer of the Service and would no longer like to be contacted by that customer, please contact that customer directly. We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the Terms of Service with our customers.

If you are a Zendesk customer and would like to opt-out of getting marketing communications from Zendesk please contact us at [privacy@zendesk.com](mailto:privacy@zendesk.com) or follow the unsubscribe instructions included in each marketing email. Requests to opt-out of transfers to our third-party vendors may also be submitted, but limitations on data sharing may make it difficult or impossible to provide the Service in this manner.

**Correcting and Updating Your Information**

Customers may update or change the personal information they have provided Zendesk by logging into the Service and providing such additional information where applicable.  If you are our customer and would like to gain access to, or request deletion of information we have collected as “data controllers,” please contact us at [privacy@zendesk.com](mailto:privacy@zendesk.com).  We will respond to such queries within thirty (30) business days.

Individuals seeking access to, or who would like to correct, amend, or delete data which may be stored in the Service should direct his query to the applicable Zendesk customer acting as the “data controller” for such information. If requested to remove individual’s data by our customer, we will respond within thirty (30) days.

**Data Retention**

Zendesk will retain personal information we process on behalf of our customers or collect directly from our customers for as long as needed to provide Service to our customers, subject to our compliance with this Policy.  We may further retain and use this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, maintain accurate accounting, financial and other operational records, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.  We have established internal policies for the deletion of data from customer accounts following termination of a customer’s subscription to the Service.

**Children’s Personal Information**

Zendesk does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13.  If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any personal information through our Service. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our Policy by instructing their children never to provide personal information through our Service without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided personal information to Zendesk through our Service, please contact us, and we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete that information.

**Changes to the Privacy Policy**

If we make any material changes to this Policy, we will notify you by email, through the Service, or by posting a prominent notice on the Zendesk Websites prior to the change becoming effective.  We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.  Your continued use of the Service constitutes your agreement to be bound by such changes to this Policy.  Your only remedy, if you do not accept the terms of this Policy, is to discontinue use of the Service.

**Business Transactions**

Zendesk may assign or transfer this Policy, and your user account and related information and data, including any personal information, to any person or entity that acquires all or substantially all of the business, stock or assets of, or is merged with, Zendesk.
