# Zenfolio - Privacy Policy

Please refer to the **Definitions** section set forth in the [Zenfolio Website Terms and Conditions of Use](https://web.archive.org/z/terms) agreement. 

Your privacy is important to us so we will strive to keep Your information safe and secure. This privacy policy will explain the kind of information we collect about You and how we use it. By accessing and using the Website, you agree to our Privacy Policy as outlined below. 

## Information We Collect from You and How We Use It

The Website collects and stores the following information: Your name, email address, and display preferences. When subscribing for paid Services or placing e-commerce orders on our Website we may also collect Your name, billing address, telephone number, billing and credit card information, shipping addresses, and payment preferences. If you sign up to receive marketing emails, we may contact you about our Services and promotions. Users who request payments to be made to them from products sold on Zenfolio may also need to provide their tax ID information for tax reporting purposes. 

We may also collect IP addresses for administration and demographic purposes and may use this information to help identify fraudulent transactions. We do not, however, link IP addresses to your computer's User ID. Additionally, we use third party analytic tools and reporting technologies to collect non-personal information such as operating system, browser software, Internet domain and host names, and activity on the Website. 

Zenfolio uses the information submitted by or collected from You to optimize the Website or services to better suit You, to process e-commerce orders or enable Photographers to process orders, and to protect against potentially fraudulent transactions. 

## We Use Cookies to Collect Information

Like almost all e-commerce web sites, we use "cookies." Cookies are bits of information that are stored on your computer by your web browser. Although our cookies don't store any of your personal information, they do allow us to provide you with a more personalized user experience, to track your use of the Website, to analyze Website activity and to allow you to login and begin use of the Website automatically when you visit. 

Whether you want your web browser to accept cookies or not is up to you. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. If you haven't changed your computer's settings, most likely your browser already accepts cookies. You can also disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-ons settings or visiting the Web site of its manufacturer. However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of features and services, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block our cookies, you will not be able to add items to your Cart, proceed to checkout, or use any services that require you to sign in. 

## How We Protect Your Information

Zenfolio uses standard industry security practices to protect Your personal information including Secure Socket Layer (SSL) transmission technology for all sensitive information exchanges. This technology encrypts information You send us to avoid it being intercepted before reaching our secure HTTPS servers. 

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us from unauthorized access or disclosure, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We assume no liability for any disclosure of data due to errors in transmission, unauthorized third party access or other acts of third parties, or other acts or omissions. 

## When We Disclose Your Information to Third Parties

Under no circumstances do we rent, trade or share your e-mail address with any other company for their marketing purposes without your consent. We may disclose the personal and non-personal information of our customers to any successor-in-interest of ours, such as a company that acquires our business. We may need to disclose your personal information when required by law or when we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process. We may share your mailing address with select third parties. Additionally, we contract with third party service providers who provide analytic tools and reporting technologies that may collect certain non-personal information via cookies, web beacons, or other types of tracking pixels. 

## Information You Disclose to Third Parties

Zenfolio assumes no responsibility for the disclosure of information of any subscriber or visitor to Photographers in the event an order is placed for fulfillment with Photographer. You specifically agree to hold Zenfolio harmless from any liability arising out of the use or misuse of any information submitted in the process of placing orders to be fulfilled by Photographers. 

Zenfolio does not control the privacy policies of any third-party sites linked to our Website. Zenfolio assumes no responsibility or liability for the actions of such third parties. It is Your responsibility to be informed of and be comfortable with the privacy policy of any third-party Website that You access. Zenfolio assumes no responsibility or liability for information that You voluntarily disclose in a public area or forum. 

In order to insure Your privacy, you must keep the secrecy of any password or personal information at all times. The ultimate responsibility for the protection of Your information rests with You. 

## Information Collected from Children

Zenfolio will not knowingly collect or use any personal information from children we know to be under the age of thirteen. In addition, once Zenfolio is notified that we are in possession of such information, we will delete any information in our databases that originates from a child under the age of thirteen. 

## Data Transfer and Storage

Zenfolio is a California corporation operated from within the United States. Accordingly, information collected by Zenfolio will be stored in the United States. If you are accessing the Website from outside of the United States, you acknowledge and agree that your information will be received by or transferred to servers located within the United States. 

## Opting Out of Certain Communications

If you are no longer interested in receiving e-mail announcements and other marketing information from us, please e-mail your request to support@zenfolio.com. Please include your complete name, e-mail address and mailing address. Note that you may still receive transaction related communications from us. 

## Changing Your Personal Information

You can obtain a copy of your personal information and request changes or deletion of your personal information and/or account by emailing us at support@zenfolio.com. For your protection, you may be required to provide proof of your identity before obtaining a copy of your personal information. 

## Changes to our Privacy Policy
