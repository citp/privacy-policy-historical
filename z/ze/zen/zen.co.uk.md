  1. **1 PURPOSE OF THIS POLICY**
    1. This policy gives the following information about personal data: 
      * what information we collect from you;
      * where we keep it;
      * why we collect it;
      * how we use it; and
      * your rights in relation to it.
  2. **2 WHAT INFORMATION MAY WE COLLECT FROM YOU?**
    1. We may collect and process the following data about you: 
      * information that you provide by filling in forms on our site [zen.co.uk](https://web.archive.org/) ( **our site** ). This includes information you provided at the time of registering to use certain elements of our site, subscribing to our services, posting material or requesting further services. We may also ask you for information when you enter a competition or promotion sponsored by Zen, and when you report a problem with our site;
      * if you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence;
      * we may also ask you to complete surveys that we use for research purposes, although you do not have to respond to them;
      * details of transactions you carry out through our site or via other means (eg telephone orders) and of the fulfilment of your orders;
      * you can access the site home page and browse the site without disclosing personal information. We collect standard Internet log information and details of visitor behaviour patterns to help us identify things such as the number of visitors to the various parts of our site. We collect this information in a way which does not identify anyone (please see **[our Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/policies/cookie-policy.aspx)** for more details); and 
      * communication and usage data, whether this is required for our own billing purposes or otherwise and the resources that you access. We may also use this data for diagnostic purposes, for planning and capacity management and to assist us in the prevention or detection of faults and/or misuse. We do not collect the content of emails that you have sent or received or keep a record of individual web pages that you have visited.
  3. **3 WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA**
    1. The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
    2. In addition, if you place your personal information on publically available parts of our site, this will be accessible to people in countries outside of the EEA. Such countries may not have data protection laws as comprehensive as those that exist within the EEA.
    3. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
    4. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Athough we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

      * to carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us;
      * to allow you to participate in any interactive features of our services, if you choose to do so; 
      * to ensure that content from our site is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer; and
      * to notify you about changes to our service.
    2. We may also use your data to provide you with information about goods and services which may be of interest to you and we may contact you about these by post or telephone.
    3. If you are an existing customer, we will only contact you by electronic means (email or SMS) with information about goods and services similar to those which were the subject of a previous sale to you.
    4. If you are not a customer we will contact you by electronic means only if you have consented to this.

    1. We may disclose your personal information to third parties: 
      * in order to fulfil your order for goods or services; 
      * to enable us to provide maintenance, engineering or troubleshooting services to you in connection with goods or services supplied to you;
      * in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets;
      * if Zen or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets;
