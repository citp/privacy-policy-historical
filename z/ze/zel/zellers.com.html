  		<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        <p>
        	<strong>Q:</strong> What is "personal information"?<br>
			<strong>A:</strong> "Personal information" is any information about an identifiable individual. This includes information such as a person's name, address and home phone number. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        	<strong>Q:</strong> Do I have to give Hbc my personal information in order to conduct business with Hbc?<br>
			<strong>A:</strong> There are several instances where you are required to give us your personal information for operational and/or administrative purposes. For example, we require your personal information in order to manage your Hbc credit or Hbc Rewards account, deliver an item to you that you may have purchased, or maintain your gift registry. Giving us your personal information for these kinds of primary operational purposes is necessary to obtain certain products and services from Hbc. 
        </p>

        <p>However, agreeing to the use of your personal information for additional secondary marketing purposes is entirely up to you. You may contact our Privacy Office at any time to request that we not use your personal information for marketing purposes.</p>
        
        <p>
        	<strong>Q:</strong> What are the differences between primary and secondary purposes of personal information collection?<br>
			<strong>A:</strong> Primary purposes are those purposes that are operational and are absolutely necessary for Hbc to be able to provide the products and/or services that you request from us. For example, a primary purpose for our collecting your address may be to ensure we can successfully deliver to your home an item you may have purchased. <br>
            Secondary purposes are any purposes that are over and above the primary/operational purposes, like sending you communications that may include notifications of sales, special events, store promotions and other exclusive offers.
        </p>

        <p>
        	<strong>Q:</strong> Will I be advised of the collection purposes prior to giving my consent?<br>
			<strong>A:</strong> Yes. When you fill out an Hbc form that asks for your personal information (e.g. credit card enrollment form, gift registry form, Hbc Rewards enrollment form, etc.) there is a privacy notice that outlines both our primary and secondary purposes for collecting your information. 
        </p>

        <p>
        	<strong>Q:</strong> Why is it important to keep Hbc up to date with regards to my personal information?<br>
			<strong>A:</strong> Keeping your personal information as accurate and up-to-date as possible ensures that you will get the best possible information and service offerings from Hbc.
        </p>

        <p>
        	<strong>Q:</strong> What are my opt-out choices?<br>
			<strong>A:</strong> You can opt-out of receiving communications via specific contact channels. For example, you can choose to no longer receive marketing-related phone calls, but you may choose to continue receiving notification of sales and exclusive offers in the mail. You cannot restrict your communications to specific programs. For example, you cannot choose to opt-out of Hbc Rewards-related offers, and still continue to receive credit-related offers. Contact our Privacy Office for more details on your opt-out choices.
        </p>


        <p>
        	<strong>Q:</strong> If I opt-out, how long will it take to stop receiving marketing materials after I contact you?<br>
			<strong>A:</strong> Many will stop immediately or within days, while others may take longer.
        </p>


        <p>
        	<strong>Q:</strong> May I review the personal information Hbc has about me? Can I obtain copies of that information?<br>
			<strong>A:</strong> Yes. You can review the personal information we have about you on file by contacting our Privacy Office. There is no cost for reasonable requests for access to your personal information, but there may be a fee to supply you with copies of records. We will advise you of the fee, if any, at the time of your request.
        </p>


        <p>
        	<strong>Q:</strong> Where can I get a copy of Hbc's Customer Privacy Brochure?<br>
			<strong>A:</strong> There are two ways you can obtain our Customer Privacy Brochure:
