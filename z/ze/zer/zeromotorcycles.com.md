## Reviewing or removing personal information

Under certain circumstances, you have the legal right to: (i) request access to your personal data; (ii) request the rectification of your personal data; (iii) request the erasure of your personal data; (iv) request the restriction of processing of your personal data; (v) object to the processing of your personal data where Zero Motorcycles relies on a legitimate interest; (vi) withdraw your consent to specific processing for which consent has previously been provided, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal; and (vii) request the transfer of your personal data to a third party.

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights).

## Zero’s security measures to protect personal information

We take reasonable organizational and technical measures to help secure your personal data, ensure availability and to help prevent unauthorized access, illegal processing or distribution, as well as accidental loss, modification or destruction. Your personal information is not stored on our public web server. In a very few cases an error log entry may be made when your personal information is submitted. Log information is retained for six months.

## Transferring information outside of the EU

Your personal information may be stored and processed in any country where we have operations. Zero Motorcycles is based outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) in the USA and your personal data will be transferred to and processed in the USA. The USA is not deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data. However, your personal data will be processed in compliance with EU data protection legislation under specific contracts approved by the European Commission which ensures the same level of protection of your personal data it has in the EEA. 

Many of our data processors are based outside the EEA so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA. 

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented: 

  * We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see [European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en).
  * Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see [European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en).
  * Where we use providers based in the USA, we may either use the above contracts approved by the European Commission or we may transfer data to them if they are part of the EU–U.S. Privacy Shield which, as outlined above, requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the USA. For further details, see [European Commission: EU-U.S. Privacy Shield](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/eu-us-privacy-shield_en).



Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.
