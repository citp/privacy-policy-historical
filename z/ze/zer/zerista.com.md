### Zerista Privacy Policy

The Zerista site, www.Zerista.com and any related web services delivered by Zerista on partner sites ("Site"), are owned and operated by Zerista, Inc. ("Zerista"). 

Zerista is committed to maintaining your confidence and trust with respect to the information we collect from you. This privacy policy sets forth the information we collect about you, how we use this information, and the choices you have about how we use such information. Your use of the Site and our use of the personal information you provide to us is subject to the terms of this privacy policy and our Terms of Use. 

### Collection and Registration of Personal Information

We sometimes request users of the Site to provide personally identifiable information. For example, in order to become a registered user of the Site, you will be required to submit certain personally identifiable information. The information collected from you is strictly voluntary. You may decline to submit personally identifiable information, in which case we may not be able to provide certain services to you. The type of information collected during the registration process may include your contact information, such as your name, e-mail address, postal address, phone number and country of residence ("Registration Information"). You may choose to provide optional profile information such as your real name, photo, company/organization affiliation, profile description, tags, location and other information which may be collected and displayed on your public profile. It is your choice to post content (for example, company affiliation) and make it publicly available. You are solely responsible for the content you post. 

### Use of Personal Information

If you submit personally identifiable information to us through the Site, then we use your personal information to operate, maintain, and provide customized features and functionality. 

Any personal information or other content that you voluntarily disclose online (for example, on your public profile, in posts, comments, or notes) becomes publicly available and could be collected and used by others. Your account User Name is displayed to other users when you post, send direct messages, or comment. Any post made in public mode or comment that you submit to the Site may be redistributed through the Internet and other media, and could be viewed by the general public. 

We do not use your email address, phone number, or other personally identifiable information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major Site changes or for customer service purposes). 

We use certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, and user location) to improve the quality and design of the Site and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing user preferences and trends. 

We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors or pages viewed; and (e) track your posts, submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests. 

### Disclosure of Personal Information to Third Parties

Access to your personal information is restricted to use by Zerista, and entities acting as our agents, representatives, or partners. We do share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, and user location) with interested third-parties to assist with understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality for the Site. 

We will not otherwise disclose any personal information without your consent except: in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our rights to defend against legal claims; and if we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, safety of person or property, violation of our policies, or as otherwise required by law. 

### Access and Changes to Your Registration Information and Preferences

You may update or correct your personal information and email preferences at any time. The accuracy of such information is solely your responsibility. 

To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting for registered users, we may receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from the Site. We may also compare our registered user list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our registered users. 

### Retention of Personal Information

We retain the personal information we collect from you for as long as the information is relevant to our business purposes or until you request that we remove the data by contacting Zerista using the contact information provided below. 

### Our Commitment to Data Security

We recognize that your privacy is important to you, and therefore we endeavor to keep your personal information confidential. For example, to protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique Password) to verify your identity before granting access to a user's account or making changes to a user's account information. However, we do not represent, warrant, or guarantee that your personal information will be protected against unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or alterations, and do not accept any liability for the security of the personal information submitted to us nor for your or third parties' use or misuse of personal information. You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique Password and account information at all times. 

### In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy

In the event that Zerista is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from our users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used
