# ZeroChaos | Privacy Policy

ZeroChaos is committed to maintaining the privacy and integrity of all information gathered for its users. We adhere to the following guidelines in the collection, storage, tracking, usage, and dissemination of your personal information.

ZeroChaos abides by the US Department of Commerce [Safe Harbor framework](http://export.gov/safeharbor/) which dictates policy on the collection, use, and retention of information from the European Union. 

You may visit the ZeroChaos web site and not be required to provide any personal information. However for our suppliers, client managers, and client workers we do collect, store, and use personal information for legitimate business purposes only. We limit the information collected to that which we believe is appropriate and necessary to conduct business, provide our services, meet client contractual terms, and comply with applicable law.

We require our employees provide personal information as required by law. We will only share that information with state and federal regulatory agencies and ZeroChaos approved banking relationships. If elected by the employee, information can be sent to ZeroChaos approved benefits providers. We may also use third parties that provide service required by law or at the request of our client. ZeroChaos will not release personal information to nonessential third parties. ZeroChaos is required by law to maintain certain personal information even after you terminate your relationship with ZeroChaos.

If you represent a ZeroChaos supplier our primary contact with you will be through our supplier portal. We may use the information provided on that site in connection with entering into or performing business with you. For example, this may include sharing information with other parts of ZeroChaos to work with other customers, financial institutions, or government authorities involved in fulfillment. It may also be used to administer and develop our relationship with you, the supplier you represent and/or other ZeroChaos suppliers generally.

In connection with a job application or inquiry, you may provide us with information about yourself, such as a resume or curriculum vitae. We may use this information throughout ZeroChaos and its related entities for the purpose of employment consideration on any job opening. We will retain this information for future job openings and will remove your profile upon written notice.

ZeroChaos is a global organization, with legal entities, business processes, clients, and systems that cross international borders. Our privacy practices are designed to provide protection for your personal information, across the globe.

We also reserve the right to provide any of your information as required by law, court order, or other valid legal processes.

Other than specified within ZeroChaos does not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others without your prior consent.

Our employees are committed to maintaining accurate information and are responsible for its protecting. Your information is safe guarded by multiple layers of access, use of encryption, and control systems including firewalls. ZeroChaos has undertaken appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to protect information we collect online.

You can change your personal information on-line or by calling Customer Service at (407) 770-6161.

We sometimes collect non-identifiable information from visits to our Web sites to help us provide a better web experience. We collect the information through the use of various technologies, including one called "cookies". A cookie is a piece of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer but not you. Some ZeroChaos pages use cookies for tracking of anonymous users and to remember registered users. You can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You can also set your browser to turn off cookies. If you do so, however, some Web sites may not work properly.
