## Privacy Policy

### Privacy

7hops.com Inc. (“ZergNet”) provides this Privacy Policy to inform users of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information received from users of ZergNet’s website, located at the domain zergnet.com (the “ZergNet Website"). Please note that this Privacy Policy only applies to the ZergNet Website.

### Information Collection and Use

It is not necessary to provide ZergNet with your personally identifiable information to use the ZergNet Website, and ZergNet does not collect personally identifiable information in connection with the operation of the ZergNet Website. If you contact ZergNet by email through the ZergNet Website, ZergNet may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence, and may use your email address, and any information that you provide to ZergNet in your message, to respond to you. ZergNet treats this information as it would treat any other unsolicited business correspondence, and has no obligation to keep this information confidential, nor to take any security measures to protect this information.

When you visit the ZergNet Website, ZergNet’s servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider, the IP address will be different every time you log on. ZergNet uses Log Data to monitor use of the ZergNet Website and the services we offer via the ZergNet Website and for the ZergNet Website’s technical administration.

### Cookies

Like many websites, ZergNet also uses "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve the ZergNet Website and the services offered via the Web Site. A cookie is a small data file that ZergNet’s servers transfer to your computer’s hard disk. ZergNet does not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information. However, IP addresses are collected by the use of cookies.

ZergNet mainly uses "session cookies", which enable certain features of the ZergNet Website and services offered via the ZergNet Website, to better understand how you interact with the Web Site and services we offer via the ZergNet Website, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the ZergNet Website, and to improve the ZergNet Website and services offered via the ZergNet Website. Session cookies should be deleted from your computer when you disconnect from or leave the ZergNet Website.

ZergNet also uses a persistent cookie that stays on your computer after you leave the ZergNet Website, for the sole purpose of ensuring that you receive a variety of ZergNet content (also called “frequency-capping”).

Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.

### Information Sharing and Disclosure

ZergNet cooperates with government and law enforcement officials or private parties, to enforce and comply with the law. ZergNet may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as ZergNet, in its sole discretion, believes necessary or appropriate to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of ZergNet or a third party, the safety of the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to comply with the law.

If any or all of the assets of ZergNet are acquired by, or merged with another entity, ZergNet will share with this entity some or all of the information collected through the ZergNet Website.

### Security

Because ZergNet does not collect any personally identifiable information from the ZergNet Website, ZergNet does not take any specific security measures to protect the information we do collect.

### Links to Other Sites

The ZergNet Website may contain links to other web sites ("Linked Sites") operated by ZergNet or third parties. Linked Sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. This Privacy Policy addresses only the use and disclosure of information that ZergNet collects through the ZergNet Website. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. ZergNet does not exercise control over third party Linked Sites. Your use of any Linked Site operated by ZergNet is subject to the terms and conditions provided by ZergNet for such Linked Site. ZergNet encourages you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.

### Our Policy Towards Children

The ZergNet Website is not directed to children under 18. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided ZergNet with personally identifiable information without their consent, he or she should contact ZergNet at info@zergnet.com. If ZergNet becomes aware that a child under 13 has provided ZergNet with personally identifiable information, ZergNet will remove such information from our files.

### Changes to this Privacy Policy

ZergNet reserves the right to change this policy at any time without prior notice. Any changes to this policy will be posted here. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at info@zergnet.com.
