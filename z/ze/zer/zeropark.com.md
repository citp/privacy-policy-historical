Mobile analytics we use within Mobile Apps allows us to improve our understand their functionality on your mobile device by tracking the events that constitute your use of the App, such as when you scroll through the App, switch to another screen, push a button, or interact with the App in another way. We do not register what you see on your screen, text you type in on your device. 

By default, Firebase collects identifiers for mobile devices (for example, Android Advertising ID and Advertising Identifier for iOS) and utilizes technologies similar to cookies. 

Firebase also collect certain information automatically, including, but not limited to, the type of mobile device you use, your client ID, the IP address of your mobile device, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browsers you use, and information about the way you use the App as well as aggregate Mobile App usage data (such as the overall number of users, session, session duration).

If the App crashes during the time you are using it, Firebase also generates for us a report including information about the type of device used, history of the user’s activity within the app before the crash and stack trace. We use this information only for diagnostics purposes to improve the functionality of our Mobile Apps. For further information how Google’s Firebase collect your data please see: https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/6318039.

All Firebase services are certified by Google under the Privacy Shield Framework.

## **VIII. How Data is protected**

Codewise uses various security technologies and procedures that help protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration or destruction. 

For example:

  *  **Personnel.** Only qualified and authorized employees are permitted to access Personal Information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions;
  *  **Data Protection Officer.** We appointed a Data Protection Officer who in particular watches over the security of your Data, monitors our compliance with GDPR, and is a point of contact for you in all matters regarding Data protection; here you have contact to our Data Protection Officer: dpo@codewise.com;
  *  **Security Measures.** We use encryption in the transmission of your Personal Information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your Personal Information;
  *  **Payments.** All supplied sensitive/credit Information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the Information confidential. After a transaction, your private Information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) will not be stored on our servers;
  *  **Additional Safeguards.** We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of your Information. Our security procedures mean that we may request proof of your identity before we disclose Personal Information to you;
  *  **Trusted vendors.** We rely only on vendors who ensure an appropriate level of security of your Data. In this context, we use only secure cloud servers, including AWS cloud – a secure, private cloud platform. AWS participates in the EU-US Privacy Shield framework. Amazon Web Services is our processor. AWS Amazon cloud platform uses various security technologies and procedures to protect personal data and is compliant with third-party assurance frameworks such as ISO 27017 for cloud security, ISO 27018 for cloud privacy, PCI DSS Level 1, and SOC 1, SOC 2, and SOC 3. For more details please see AWS Amazon security and privacy policy at www.aws.amazon.com.



We want you to feel confident using our Site to conduct business. However, you should also take care of how you handle and disclose your Data and avoid sending Personal Information through insecure channels or networks. It is important for you to protect yourself against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when you finish using a shared computer and under no circumstances do not share your password with anyone, even with us – we will NEVER ask for it.

Please see more Information about security measures we use **here**. 

## **IX. International transfer of Data**

Codewise may transfer Data to a country outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), i.e. to the territory of United States of America for which the European Commission has adopted an adequacy decision ( **Privacy Shield** ), in order to protect storage and processing of data using IT services, as well as operating the Site and providing the Services. 

The EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework is a “partial” adequacy decision, as, in the absence of a general data protection law in the U.S., only the companies committing to abiding by the binding Privacy Shield principles benefit from easier data transfers.

For the above reasons, in such cases your Personal Data will be transferred to the territory of USA in accordance with applicable laws, with appropriate safeguards in place, **only to Privacy Shield certified vendors** (according to the EU Commission Decision 2016/1250) or **by using standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission** (EU Commission Decision on standard contractual clauses for the transfer of Personal Data to processors established in third countries under Directive 95/46/EC (the “Model Contract Clauses”), or based on other applicable transborder data transfer mechanisms.

If you are located in the EEA, you may contact us if you require a copy of the safeguards which we have put in place to protect your Data transferred outside of the EEA and your privacy rights in these circumstances.

Please note, that for marketing purposes your Data will be processed until such time you object to it.
