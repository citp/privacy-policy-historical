# Map with Confidence - Privacy

Zee Source recognizes and respects the privacy of users of this Web site.

When you choose to provide us with information about yourself, Zee Source will act in a responsible manner. Zee Source may store and disclose personal information as allowed or required by applicable law, including making disclosures that are necessary or advisable to: (i) protect the rights, safety or property of Zee Source or others and (b) conform to legal or regulatory requirements.

For strong password protection, we store them using the [bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt) hashing function.

When you upload data from a Cloud Drive Spreadsheet, e.g., Google GDrive or Microsoft’s OneDrive, we only read information from your spreadsheet to place information on your maps. We do not modify your Cloud Drive spreadsheet in any way. We might ask you to provide us with your email address when you access the cloud drive spreadsheet, so we can inform you about the status of your data upload to the maps. The Cloud Drive spreadsheet data is not used in any other way except to place the information on your maps.

Without your express approval, however, Zee Source will not trade, sell or rent your personal information but may collect and/or provide aggregate statistics about its Web site and users to other parties.

When you view certain parts of the Web site, information may be stored on your computer. This information will be in the form of a “Cookie” or similar file and will permit tailoring of the Web site to better match your interests and/or preferences.

This site, however, contains links to other Web sites and Zee Source does not control the privacy policies of those sites.
