Our website may also contain links and advertisements which link to third party websites.  We have no control over the privacy policies of such third parties and we encourage you to review such policies prior to providing any information to or purchasing goods or services from such third parties.

## 2\. How we use information collected

We may use the personal information collected by us for the following purposes:

We store and process information (both personal and non-personally identifiable information) on servers in several different countries around the world, including New Zealand, Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom.  We may, therefore, hold or process your personal information on a server located outside the country where you live.  Information held in another country may be subject to the privacy laws of that country and may permit government and other regulatory authorities to access such information in certain circumstances.

## 3\. Information Zeald shares

Ensuring and respecting your privacy is important to us.  We do not sell, trade, rent or otherwise share your personal information with third parties unless one of the following circumstances apply:

  * **With your consent:  **We may share personal information with third parties when we have your express consent to do so.
  * ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ **With your employer:  **If your employer is our customer and your interactions with us or use of our services is in the course of your employment, your employer will have access to the information you have provided to us (including records of communications, login information and other data).
  * **With our contractors and service providers:** We sometimes engage other trusted businesses and persons to provide services and perform functions on our behalf (for example, our digital business specialists, content specialists and credit card providers).  We may provide such persons with access to personal information needed to perform their functions, based on our instructions and in accordance with appropriate security, privacy and confidentiality measures.
  * **Jointly provided services:  **In some cases, we may provide services jointly with other businesses or organisations.  For such ‘co-branded’ offerings in which a third party is involved, we may share or jointly collect customer information with that third party.  In such cases, we will make it clear at the outset who is collecting or receiving the information and whose privacy statement governs its use.
  * **For legal purposes:** We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect or enforce our rights, to protect against harm or the rights, property or safety of others or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us.



Also, in the event that Zeald or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, our customer information will be one of the transferred assets.  In that case, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and will give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

Occasionally we may send information or offers to you on behalf of other organisations or businesses.  When we do this, however, we do not share your personal information with those other organisations or businesses.  

We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our contractors, service providers and other third parties such as marketing, search and research organisations, for example, Google.

## 5\. Accessing and Correcting Personal Information

You have a right to access and ask us to correct or delete any inaccurate personal information we may hold about you.  If you would like to review or correct your personal information, please contact us using the details at the bottom of this Privacy Policy:

If you contact us we may, for your protection, ask you for additional information to verify your identity.  We will use all reasonable efforts to provide the access you request within 10 working days and will correct or delete any inaccurate personal information you discover unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes.  

Please be aware that even after your request for a change or deletion of information is processed, we may keep a copy of the information that you originally provided to us in our archives for uses documented in this Privacy Policy and may for a time, retain residual information about you in backup and/or archival copies of our databases.

## 6\. Information Security

To protect your private information as you enter it on our website, Zeald uses encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.  When you pay online by credit card, Zeald uses a PCI-DSS compliant third-party payment gateway, Payment Express to securely process the payment.  Click here to view the [Payment Express Privacy Policy](http://www.paymentexpress.com/privacy-policy).

## 7\. How we retain your personal information

We retain personal information regarding you for as long as your account is active, to provide you with the services contracted. We also retain personal information for as long as necessary to achieve the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, for example, to comply with our legal obligations, to protect us in the event of disputes and to enforce our agreements and to protect our and others’ interests.  

The precise periods for which we keep your personal information vary depending on the nature of the information and why we need it. Factors we consider in determining these periods include the minimum required retention period prescribed by law or recommended as best practice, the period during which a claim can be made with respect to an agreement or other matter, whether the personal information has been aggregated or pseudonymised, and other relevant criteria. For example, the period we keep your email address is connected to how long your account is active, while the period for which we keep a support message is based on how long has passed since the last submission in the thread.

You may have a seasonal site or come back to us after an account becomes inactive, we don’t immediately delete your personal information if you cancel all services. Instead, we keep your personal information for a reasonable period of time, so it will be there for you if you come back.

You may delete your account by contacting us at accounts@zeald.com and Zeald will delete the personal information it holds about you (unless we need to retain it for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy).

Please note that in the course of providing our services, we collect and maintain aggregated, anonymised or de-personalised information which we may retain indefinitely.
