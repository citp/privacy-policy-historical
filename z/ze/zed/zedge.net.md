####  **1\. What information do we collect?** 

When you enter this website, we collect your browser information (which typically includes browser type, version, host operating system and browser language) and IP address. This information is gathered for all visitors. In general, you can browse this website without giving us any additional information. However, to enjoy the benefits of a number of the services offered on this website, we need to have certain information about you. To access these services, you will, from time to time, be asked to submit personal information about yourself. In order to provide you with an account at Zedge that allows you to store your preferences and which includes other benefits and conveniences of our service, we need to collect information from you when you register such as your screen name and password, gender, date of birth, email address, mobile phone information, location (by country) and local time zone. You will also be asked about your desire to receive a number of optional services that include newsletters, competitions, alerts, SMS text messages, live chats, message boards and other benefits of Zedge membership. You may view and make adjustments to your user preferences at any time by logging into Zedge and selecting "My Account > Settings > Privacy".

Should you choose to include additional personal information to be displayed on your user profile on our website we will necessarily process these details. Voluntarily submitted profile details means we may also collect from you information such as:

  * more detailed contact information (including hometown and/or a picture of yourself);
  * information regarding your personal or professional interests;
  * your likes and dislikes; and
  * information regarding your experiences with our services.



If you choose to submit information about your religious or philosophical beliefs, your health, sexual life, racial or ethnic background, criminal history or trade union membership Zedge would necessarily have to process those details in operating your account and profile and your submission of such information would be your explicit consent for us to do so.

You will have the opportunity to make your user profile information visible (public) or invisible (private/hidden). By default, profile information is set to visible. You can change your profile to invisible (and vice-versa) at any time by going to "My Account" selecting the link for "Edit Profile" and then making the selection under "Public Profile Status".

If you make any postings to public areas, such as forums, guestbook, or by providing content, then this information will be stored on our databases for public viewing, and in such case any personally identifiable information you submit will be publicly available and can be read, collected and used by other users, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.

By entering your details in the fields requested, you enable Zedge and its service providers to provide you with the services you select. Whenever you provide such personal information, we will treat that information in accordance with this policy.

####  **2\. Information on visitors** 

During the course of any visit to Zedge, the pages you see, along with something called a "cookie", is downloaded to your computer. Most websites do this, because cookies allow the website publisher to ascertain whether the computer (and probably its user) has visited the site before. Any information that is supplied by cookies can help us to provide you with a better service and assists us to analyze the profile of our visitors. Cookies make it easier for you to maintain your preferences on Zedge, and by seeing how you use Zedge; we can tailor our website around your preferences. For example: if on a previous visit you went to the mobile wallpaper section, then we might find this out from your cookie and highlight wallpapers that might interest you on your next visit.

####  **3\. More information about cookies** 

The purpose of cookies used by Zedge has been previously explained above in this Privacy Policy. When you enter a site that utilizes "cookies" your computer will automatically be issued with a cookie, provided your internet browser is set to accept them (most are by default). Cookies are text files that identify your computer to our server. Cookies in themselves do not identify the individual user, just the computer used. Cookies themselves only record those areas of the site that have been visited by the computer in question, and for how long. Users have the opportunity to set their computers to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. The last of these, of course, means that certain personalized services cannot then be provided to that user. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. You can, should you chose, disable the cookies from your browser and delete all cookies currently stored on your computer. For example, if you are using Internet Explorer, this can be done by selecting "Tools / Internet Options" and then reviewing your privacy settings or selecting "delete cookies". This may, however, prevent you from taking full advantage of the services that this website has to offer.

More information can be obtained on cookies by visiting [www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html) which is run by the Interactive Advertising Bureau.

####  **4\. Use and storage of your personal information** 

When you supply any personal information to Zedge (e.g., for competitions, Zedge Community services or Zedge membership) we may have legal obligations towards you based upon privacy laws and regulations in the way we deal with that data. We will collect the information fairly, that is, we will explain how we will use it and tell you if we want to pass the information on to anyone else.

The information you provide to Zedge will be used for the following reasons:

  * to ensure that content from our site is presented to you in the most effective manner and to personalize your visit to our site;
  * to enable us to continuously enhance the Zedge service, to serve advertising, and to provide to you information, products or services which we feel may be of interest to you (which also helps keep our service free);
  * to occasionally carry out market research including internal analytical research which will enable us to constantly improve your experience on Zedge;
  * to carry out our obligations arising from any agreements that may have been entered into between you and us;
  * to allow you to participate in interactive features of our service, when you choose to do so; and
  * to notify you about changes to or other information about our service.



We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as you use the service(s) you have requested, and remove it in the event that the purpose has been met, or, in the case of you no longer wish to continue your status as a Zedge member. In some circumstances it may be necessary to retain your personal information to deal with any disputes. Accordingly, Zedge may store messaging transcript data (including message content, member names, times and dates) arising from the use of Zedge Community services for a period necessary to fulfill such purpose. Where personal information is held for people who are not yet registered but have taken part in other Zedge services (e.g. competitions), that information will be held only as long as necessary to ensure that the service is run smoothly. We will ensure that all personal information supplied is held securely, in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.

Your personal data will be stored on our backup system, which is kept in case of loss of data. It may be that where data is lost, the personal data held on you as part of our backup system is used to restore your account to its status before the loss of data. All personal data (including communication data) stored on the backup system shall be held in accordance with the Data Retention Directive.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access. Zedge may contact you for a number of purposes related to the service you have signed up for. For example, we may wish to provide you with password reminders or notify you that a particular service has been improved or suspended. The only way you can opt out of receiving these types of administration communications would be to close your registration, which can be accomplished by following the link indicated "To close your Zedge account" in the "My Account" area.

####  **5\. Disclosure of your information** 

We will not pass on your personal information to third parties except in accordance with (i) this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service, (ii) where there is a proposed sale or restructuring of Zedge Ltd. or (iii) where we are required by law to disclose that information. We do not share, sell, rent or trade personally identifiable information with third parties for their promotional purposes. Your personally identifiable information will never be supplied to anyone outside Zedge without first obtaining your consent, except where we are obliged or permitted by law to disclose it without obtaining your consent in advance, or where there is a proposed or consummated sale or restructuring of Zedge Ltd. Accordingly, we reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our web site. Additionally, we may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the Zedge service or using the Zedge name, or to prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies. We employ service providers and other companies and individuals to perform functions and provide services on our behalf who may have access to your member information needed to perform their functions and also to provide you with the services that you have requested, but may not use it for any other purpose. Such service providers may include credit card transaction processors, communication platform providers, and hosting services providers, and the information that could be provided to these service providers may include names, credit card numbers, email addresses and mobile phone numbers. Such service providers will be subject to appropriate contractual arrangements and security obligations as required by law. Zedge may also provide aggregate (but not personally identifiable) statistics about our members, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third-party vendors. In addition, Zedge will make your personal information available to its US parent company IDT Internet Mobile Group for the purposes of group management, statistical analysis, product development and content moderation, provided that it will not use your personal information for promotional purposes.

Zedge does contain third party advertising and sponsorship. These third-party websites and advertisers, or Internet advertising companies working on their behalf, sometimes use technology to send (or "serve") the advertisements that appear on our website directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads, to personalize advertising content, to compile anonymous statistics and otherwise monitor the effectiveness of their campaigns. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features that they may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third-party websites are not covered by this policy.

Zedge has a "Share with Friends" feature that allows you to send email messages to your friends that contain links to content at Zedge. In order to use this feature, you will need to enter the third party's email address. Zedge will only use this third party email address for transmitting the email message and Zedge does not thereafter retain these email addresses.

####  **6\. Direct Marketing** 

We would like to provide you with information via email about new products, promotions, special offers and other information which we think you may find interesting. We fully appreciate that "spam" has become a problem in recent years and this is why we make sure you have the power to choose whether or not you want to receive such mailings. We will give you the option of opting in to receive any such marketing mailings when you register for Zedge, or afterwards via an email message or web page screen. If you choose to opt in, you may at any time afterwards change this preference by logging into your account and accessing "My Account > Account", and select that you want to opt out of receiving specific mailings.

####  **7\. Access to your personal information** 

You have the right to request a copy of the personal information Zedge holds about you and to have any inaccuracies corrected under the Data Protection Act 1998. There may be a small charge for such administration requests. All such enquiries should be sent to our Data Protection Officer whose contact information is listed at the bottom of this Privacy Policy. Additionally, you may at any time change your personal information by logging into your account, following the "My Account" link and then going to the "Edit Profile."

####  **8\. Links to other websites** 

Our site may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.

####  **9\. Users under age 16** 

If you are under the age of 16, you are not permitted to register as a user of the Zedge website.

 **A Note for Parents Concerning Privacy**

Our web site is not intended for use by children under the age of 16, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 16. Zedge seeks to encourage children to consult with their parents before submitting their data. However, Zedge believes that parents should supervise their children's online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a safe online environment for children to work within. These tools can also prevent children from disclosing personal information without parental permission. For additional information about parental control tools, please consult the "Consumer Assistance" page of the Direct Marketing Association home page which can be found at [www.the-dma.org](http://www.the-dma.org/).

####  **10\. Ownership Changes** 

If the ownership of all or substantially all of the Zedge business, or individual business units owned by Zedge Ltd., were to change, your user information may be transferred to the new owner so the service can continue operations. In any such transfer of information, your user information would remain subject to the provisions of the current privacy policy.

####  **11\. Changes to this Privacy Policy** 

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy policy page, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently, and at least each time you submit personal information to Zedge. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our homepage. The date of the most recent revisions will also appear on this page. Unless stated otherwise, our current privacy policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account.
