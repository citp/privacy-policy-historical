    <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>

    <p><em>Date of Last Revision: October 7th, 2016</em></p>

    <p>This privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") describes how Zedge, Inc. ("Zedge" or
        "we" or "us") uses personal information in running our business. Zedge is available from our
        websites, including but not limited to, www.zedge.net, m.zedge.net and t.zedge.net
        ("Websites") and mobile applications ("Mobile Apps"). We refer to our Website visitors and
        Mobile App users as users ("Users") of Zedge's Services ("Services"). Please read our
        <a href="/terms/">Terms of Service</a>&nbsp;and our <a href="/online-safety/">online safety and
            best practices guidelines</a>. By visiting any of the Websites or using any of the
        Mobile Apps, you are accepting and consenting to the practices described in the Privacy
        Policy.</p>


    <h5>1. WHAT TYPES OF INFORMATION DOES ZEDGE COLLECT?</h5>


    <p><strong>User Provided Information</strong>.&nbsp;We obtain certain information when you provide it
        to us: for
        example, if you setup your account profile, participate in a discussion board or report a
        problem on one of the Websites, you may provide your name, email address, your date of
        birth, photograph, and a list of interests such as your favorite music and television shows.
        Some of that information can be used by Zedge to identify or contact you directly and is
        sometimes referred to as personally identifiable information.</p>


    <p><strong>Information from Use of our Services</strong>.&nbsp;Zedge also gathers non-personally
        identifiable
        information from Users of our Services. Non-personally identifiable information is
        information that usually cannot by itself be used to identify a particular person or entity,
        and may include: the Internet Protocol (IP) address, unique device identifiers, anonymous
        IDs for advertising, operating system, mobile network information, browser type, existing
        applications, browsing activity and non-precise device location information (e.g., city or
        region). Zedge enables you to send messages to other Users in the Zedge community. We
        ordinarily don't read the content of these messages unless we reasonably believe the Service
        is being misused or as required by law; we keep track of the number of messages sent and
        similar information to keep our Services running smoothly. Zedge also enables you to
        'friend' other members of the Zedge community, and records which members of the community
        you've friended, which Zedge groups you've joined, and what pieces of content you've
        uploaded via the Services.</p>


    <p><strong>Zedge Login</strong>. When you login directly through Zedge, we can access the
        information you
        provided during your account profile setup.</p>


    <p><strong>User Generated Content</strong>.&nbsp; We offer our Users the opportunity to post reviews,
        upload images
        and audio, and offer opinions. Such postings are governed by our&nbsp;<a href="/terms/">Terms of
            Service</a>. In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when
        searches are executed on the subject of your posting. Whenever you voluntarily disclose
        personally identifiable information on publicly viewable web pages or applications, that
        information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others and
        reproduced on websites or services over which we have no control. Further information is
        contained in the&nbsp;Zedge online safety and best practices guidelines.</p>


    <p><strong>Facebook Connect</strong>.&nbsp; When you choose to connect or login to Zedge with your
        Facebook account,
        we can access certain information you've added on Facebook in order to provide a social and
        personalized experience while using the Service. We adhere to the
        <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/policy/">Facebook Platform Policies</a> which
        restrict how we may can access and use this information. If you log into
        our services via Facebook Connect, we collect information from your Facebook account,
        including but not limited to: your name, city, your birthday, your Facebook Connect ID, and
        the list of your Facebook friends.</p>


    <p><strong>Google +</strong>. When you choose to connect or login to Zedge with Google +, we can
        access certain
        information you've added on Google + in order to provide a social and personalized
        experience while using the Service. We adhere to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/+/web/policies">Google + Platform Developer
            Policies</a>
        ,&nbsp;which restrict how we may can access and use this information. If you log into
        our services via Google +, we collect information from your Google + account, including but
        not limited to: your name, city, your birthday, and contacts.</p>


    <p><strong>Other Login Methods</strong>. Zedge may also incorporate alternative log in methods
        not listed here,
        which may follow a similar protocol to the log in methods listed above.</p>


    <p><strong>Device Information</strong>. When you access the Services on your wireless device, we
        may obtain
        information from your wireless carrier about the type of device you are using. We may use
        this information to notify you about what type of features and products from Zedge may be
        available to you on your device.</p>


    <p><strong>Mobile Phone Number</strong>. Certain features of the Services may require our
        collection of the phone
        number of your device. We may associate that phone number to the mobile device
        identification information. We will not use that number for telemarketing.</p>


    <p><strong>Location</strong>. Depending on the provider, we may automatically receive general
        location
        information when you use our Services. In the future, if we begin to offer Services that use
        technology that pinpoints precise geolocation, we will ensure that we have your consent (an
        opt-in) before doing so. We may use and store this information to provide enhanced
        location-based Services as well as to serve location-targeted advertising without your
        express opt-in, which includes communication to third party Services providers who have
        agreed with Zedge to keep such information confidential and only use such information to the
        extent necessary to perform the Services as required by Zedge.</p>


    <p><strong>Zedge Beta Users</strong>. From time to time, Zedge will offer to its users the
        opportunity to Beta
        test a new Mobile App or Mobile App feature. Participation is entirely voluntary. Users who
        elect to sign-up to Beta test these features are "Beta Users". Beta Users may be asked to
        provide additional personal information as part of the Beta test, such as precise
        geolocation, or will be able to access certain other features, such as making in-app
        purchases. For each Beta test, the Beta User will be provided with a disclosure about the
        data collection, use, and sharing practices specific to that Beta test, and will only be
        permitted to become a Beta User upon acceptance of those specific terms.</p>


    <p><strong>Cookies</strong>. Zedge uses a number of cookies to collect non-personal information
        for many
        purposes. You can see a list of the cookies we use in our <a href="/cookies/">Cookie
            Policy</a>. Please note that by using the Services you are consenting to the
        use of cookies.</p>


    <h5>2. HOW DOES ZEDGE USE INFORMATION?</h5>


    <p><strong>User Provided Information</strong>.&nbsp;We use the personally identifiable information in
        the file we
        maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on
        the Services to: deliver the products and services that you have requested, manage your
        account and provide you with customer support, communicate with you about products or
        services that may be of interest to you, and to monitor compliance with the rules governing
        the Services. We don't sell your personally identifiable information to third parties.</p>


    <p><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information from the use of our Services</strong>.&nbsp;Zedge
        analyzes
        non-personally-identifying information gathered from users of the Services to help better
        understand how our Services are being used and to help tailor content and advertising across
        the Services. By recognizing patterns and trends in usage, Zedge is able to better design
        the Services to improve Users' experiences, both in terms of content and ease of use. We
        also may share non-personally-identifying information with third parties, including but not
        limited to advisors, advertisers, analytics providers, and investors, for the purpose of
        conducting business.</p>


    <p><strong>Friend information</strong>&nbsp;- Zedge enables you to 'friend' other members of the
        Zedge community.
        Further information can be found in our <a href="/online-safety/">online safety and
            best practices guidelines</a>. Your "friends" can see certain information about you,
        including: links to your
        Facebook account (if you have connected that account to your Zedge account), a list of your
        friends, and the content you've uploaded into the Zedge Services. We offer you the ability
        to control the types of information that is available to friends, and to the public via the
        Services. As part of connecting you to your friends, we may search your phone's contacts for
        other friends using Zedge who you may want to connect with and let you know who they are.
        However, we do not store the information from your phone's contact list on our servers.</p>

        facilitate the purchase of such content, our advertisers and their partners may collect
