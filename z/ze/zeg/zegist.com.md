# Privacy Policy - Zegist - Join the Conversation

Our privacy policy provides information on how we collect, use, share and protect information of our members and visitors when they use our site. By becoming a member of our community, you are agreeing to our policies, rules, as well as our terms of services.

## Information

We do our best to protect the information of our members. You can manage information that is visible to the public by clicking on your profile settings and selecting choice information that should be made public. 

The nature of information we collect is also dependent on how you use our services. You can either be a Guest User or a Registered User. A Guest User has limited access, and can only go through topics without being able to join in the conversation. A Registered User however has full license to participate in conversations and also the ability to share topics from our site to their various social media pages.

## Notifications

Part of the reasons why we collect information such as email address, is to notify users about a new topic, or their involvement in a conversation. If a user responds to the topic started by a user, or mentions them in a post, a notification will be sent via email informing them of their involvement in a new or existing topic. Some people may view the notifications as being intrusive depending on how often they are involved in a conversation. Users can however change notification settings from their profiles and choose whether or not to receive these notifications.

## Being Anonymous

The fact that you can send messages without other people knowing your true identity is what makes Zegist unique. We understand that some people better express themselves when they are not known. So Zegist has provided that avenue for people to join conversations on the basis of being anonymous.

Note that if you are a Registered User and you participate in a conversation anonymously, our Service will still have a record of the fact that you are the person behind the anonymous account, even if we keep this private. However, if someone abuses the option of being anonymous by making offensive comments and insulting words because they know people don’t know who they are, you have the ability to report that user to us so that we will take appropriate action. We have also built in site moderation techniques to protect you and to prevent users from transmitting harmful content.

## Online Analytics

For better understanding of the way you use our services, we may use third-party web analytics, particularly Google Analytics. This is to help us monitor traffic on our site. The information collected by this technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate Zegist users’ use of the services. To prevent Google 

Analytics from collecting or using your information, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on.

## Plagiarism

We do not claim ownership of any of the images or stories put up on our site. To avoid copyright and plagiarism issues, we advise every member of the community to give credit to the owners of every form of intellectual property they use. 

## Language

We are very diverse and are particular about every of our members. We advise that members refrain from making comments that are offensive, defamatory and slanderous. The opinions of every member should be respected.

## Account Deactivation

Users have the right to deactivate their accounts if they are no longer interested in our services. At this, we will no longer have any information about them in our database. We also reserve the right to delete member profiles that are libelous, defamatory, invasive of privacy, in violation of copyright law, inappropriate or otherwise deemed unacceptable. Users that repeatedly create such accounts will continue to be banned.

## Changes to our Policy

Our policies are subject to change, and if there is need for any of them to be changed, we will post them on this page. So please check this page periodically to get updates on any changes.
