<span class="content_yellowtext"><b>PURPOSE</b></span>
<br>
<p>1.1) Where the Company and its group of radio stations are 
engaged in Commercial Activities that sometimes involve the collection of 
personal and private information from customers, suppliers and the general 
public; and <br>
1.2) Where the Company and its group of radio stations are sensitive 
to the collection and use of that information because of its importance to the 
individual from whom it was collected; and <br>
1.3) Where the Company and its group 
of radio stations wish to be in compliance with certain federal legislation as 
it relates to the collection and use of personal private information; THE 
COMPANY HEREBY ENACTS THIS POLICY ON THE COLLECTION AND RETENTION OF PERSONAL 
PRIVATE INFORMATION.</p>

<span class="content_yellowtext"><b>SCOPE</b></span>


<p>2.1) This policy is intended to address the collection and use 
of information that is both personal and identifiable to an individual. Personal 
and Identifiable Information includes personal characteristics such as home 
address, telephone number, social insurance number and financial information.<br> 
2.2) For clarity, this policy is not meant to capture the collection of 
corporate information from other companies or businesses. 2.3) This policy shall 
also apply to any consultant such as lawyers and accountants that the Company 
may engage in the regular course of business.</p>

<span class="content_yellowtext"><b>SOURCE OF INFORMATION</b></span>

<p>Clients 3.1) The Media Industry is driven primarily by 
advertising. Private individuals often purchase ad time, which necessitates the 
collection of contact information and financial information for proper contract 
maintenance and collection. <br>
3.2) Further, the collection of contact information 
allows the company to follow up with clients to offer future advertising time as 
it becomes available. General Public <br>
3.3) The Radio Business is interactive in 
nature and engages its audience. As a result, listeners will often be invited to 
“call-in” for reasons such as contests or making requests. <br>
3.4) The contact 
information of the caller will be recorded in order to ensure the proper 
collection of prizes. Upon claiming a prize, photo identification is recorded 
for accounting purposes. <br>
3.5) In the past few years, Radio has expanded onto the 
internet to allow for more personalized listening. Information gathered through 
the use of our web-site on cookies can NOT identify users and is beyond the 
scope of this policy. Identifiable information is voluntarily provided by 
listeners in order to join fan clubs, participate in surveys or contests and to 
provide feed-back. We may use this information to provide listeners with 
promotional material of general interest. A listener may “opt-out” at any time 
and the Personal Information is removed from our data-base. <br>
3.6) Occasionally, 
listeners may take offence to an item they heard, or thought they heard, on our 
stations and may file a complaint with the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council 
(CBSC). Under CBSC guidelines, we are required to respond to the complainant 
directly and will receive their contact information in order to comply with the 
regulations. <br>
3.7) Our stations are continuously updating our talent-banks. As a 
result, we are provided with resumes and demos from members of the public. As a 
result, we require contact information in order to conduct interviews, etc. 
Although we do not require certain information, some individuals may also 
provide us with birthdates and Social Insurance Numbers which are held in the 
strictest confidence. Employees/Independent Contractors <br>
3.8) To ensure proper 
payment and accounting of staff and contractors, we are required to collect 
Identifiable Information from individuals such as contact information, banking 
information, legal status to work in Canada, Social Insurance Numbers. <br>
3.9) To ensure the safety of Employees and Contractors, we also collect family 
information to be used in the case of an emergency which occurs during work 
hours. Students <br>
3.10) Our stations will often work with Universities and 
Colleges through their Co-Operative Education programs and will hire students 
for a determined work-term. <br>
3.11) In order to determine we have hired qualified 
candidates, the Company will collect academic information including academic 
records and student numbers. <br>
3.12) In order to ensure the effectiveness of the 
Co-Op program, the Company will continue to collect personal information such as 
performance reviews of students throughout the work-term. Students acknowledge 
the importance of this collection process to the program and understand that it 
will be shared with their academic institution whatever its content. </p>

<span class="content_yellowtext"><b>USE AND DISCLOSURE</b></span>
<p>4.1) None of the Personal and Identifiable Information 
collected shall be used for any purpose other than those outlined in this 
policy.  <br>
4.2) It is rare that the Company would disclose any Personal and 
Identifiable Information without the consent of the individual concerned. There 
are certain instances, however, where such consent is not required such as 
medical emergencies, debt collection, reporting to federal agencies (such as 
Canada Revenue Agency) and the Courts or during the investigation of a criminal 
activity. </p>

<span class="content_yellowtext"><b>STORAGE OF PRIVATE INFORMATION</b></span>

<p>5.1) The Company shall endeavour to keep the information 
covered by this Policy secure during the entire time is in the possession of the 
company. To that end, information is held and viewable only by employees whose 
job requires them to have access to that information. <br>
5.2) As a general rule, 
Personal Information shall be maintained for a minimum period of seven (7) years 
to satisfy the audit requirements of the Canada Revenue Agency. At the end of 
that period, all documents shall be destroyed in a manner that is acceptable to 
the tax authorities. <br>
5.3) Employee/Contractor personnel files will be maintained 
for the duration of employment and will be kept for the length of any limitation 
period in which an employee can bring suit against the Company. <br>
5.4) Applications received from the general public will be held only as long as 
required to staff vacant positions. </p>

<span class="content_yellowtext"><b>ACCESS TO INFORMATION</b></span>

possession of Personal Information is entitled to know the degree and content of 
that information. <br>
6.2) In order to view the Information, an individual must

nature of the information sought with as much precision as is possible in the 
circumstances. No information will be revealed in any manner other than during a 
personal meeting with the Privacy Officer. <br>
6.3) We may charge a fee to recover 
any expenses incurred in processing your request. <br>
6.4) Not every request to view 
personal information will be granted. There are certain legal exceptions to the

6.5) upon viewing the information, an individual may request
