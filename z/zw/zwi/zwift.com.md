# Zwift

**Last Updated June 25, 2018.**

Zwift is an at home social fitness service. We create virtual experiences, structured workouts, and group events so that you can reach your training goals and interact with other people who use Zwift. This means that Zwift is a social platform, and that your profile information and information about your rides, runs, races, and other workouts is shared with other users and, with your permission, shared with companies that allow users to connect with each other on other platforms.

The privacy of our users is important to us and we have prepared this Privacy Policy to explain to you how we collect, use, and share information we obtain through your use of the websites, applications, virtual cycling and other workout games, and other services (“Services”) that are operated or controlled by Zwift, Inc. (collectively, “we,” “us” or “our”).

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.

#### Collection of Information

##### Information You Provide to Us

To work out with Zwift, you’ll need to create an account. To create an account, we ask you to provide your first and last name, your email address, your country, and information about you such as your date of birth, gender, height, and weight, so that we can accurately calculate information about your workout. We also collect any information you provide to customize your profile, such as a profile picture or avatar. **Your profile information, including your name, gender, age, height, and weight, is public, so you should use caution in deciding what name to use.**

If you subscribe to the Services or make a purchase, we collect your payment method and your home address. Finally, we collect any other information you provide to us, such as to sign up for an event, fill out a form, participate in a survey or contest, apply for a job, communicate with us via third party social media sites, or request customer support.

##### Information about Your Workouts

When you work out with Zwift, we collect information about that workout, such as your route, your cadence, your effort, how long you rode or ran, your total output and total calories burned, elevation gain, and, if you are using a heart  rate monitor, your heart rate. We also collect information about any screen shots you take, challenges and missions completed and your experience level (e.g., Academy status), and fitness test results.

##### Other Information about Your Use of the Services

In the Services, you can chat with other users, give them a “Ride On” (like a “thumbs up”), and find and follow other users. Whatever you do, we collect and store information about that activity.

##### Automatically Collected Information

When you access or use our Services, we automatically collect information about you, including:

  * **Log Information:**  We collect log information about your use of the Services, including the type of browser you use, app version, access times, pages viewed, your IP address and the page you visited before navigating to our Services.
  * **Device Information:  **We collect information about the computer or mobile device you use to access our Services, including the hardware model, operating system and version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information.
  * **Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies:**  We use different technologies to collect information, including cookies, web beacons, and software development kits or “SDKs.” Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us improve our Services and your experience, see which areas and features of our Services are popular, and count visits. Web beacons are electronic images that may be used in our Services or emails and help deliver cookies, count visits, and understand usage and campaign effectiveness. SDKs operate similarly to cookies and web beacons, but in applications rather than on websites. For more information about cookies and how to disable them, please see "Your Choices" below.



##### Information We Collect from Other Sources

If you create or log into your account through a social media site or ask another fitness service to share information with us, we will have access to certain information from that site or service, such as your name, account information, and friends lists, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such social media or fitness site or service.

#### Use of Information

We use the information we collect to provide, maintain, and improve our Services, such as to track your workouts, show you information about who else is working out with you, publish information about your workouts to other users, and allow you to connect with and engage with other users. We also use the information we collect to:

  * Send you technical notices, updates, security alerts, and support and administrative messages and to respond to your comments, questions, and customer service requests;
  * Communicate with you about products, services, offers, and events offered by Zwift and others, and provide news and information we think will be of interest to you;
  * Monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities in connection with our Services;
  * Detect, investigate, and prevent fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities and protect the rights and property of Zwift and others;
  * Personalize and improve the Services and provide advertisements, content, or features that match user profiles or interests;


  * Facilitate contests, sweepstakes, and promotions and process and deliver entries and rewards; and


  * Carry out any other purpose described to you at the time the information was collected.



##### Sharing of Information

Part of the fun of Zwift is connecting with other users around the world.  So, when you use Zwift Services, we share information about you with other users. This includes your profile information (including your first and last name, country, gender, height, weight, and age) and information about your workouts (such as what ride or run you took and when, how fast you went, and how you performed). This information is available to other users both while you workout and after, and your workout may be broadcast on a service like Twitch TV or YouTube by Zwift or by other users. In addition, your posts on message boards and in discussion rooms will be visible to Zwift and other Zwift users. We do not share your date of birth or your email address with other users without your consent.

Zwift’s Services may also allow you to share your information outside of Zwift. For instance, you may integrate your Zwift account with third-party fitness apps such Strava, Fitbit, Garmin, and others. When you integrate with other services in this manner, we will share information in accordance with your interactions and preferences. In addition, you may choose to share your profile and workout information with select Zwift partners, such as Zwift Power, to enable them to extend your Zwift experience. When you share information in this way, your information may be publicly available.

We do not share your information outside of Zwift and the Zwift community except in the following circumstances:

  * With vendors, consultants, and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work on our behalf;
  * In response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law or legal process, including lawful requests by public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements;
  * If we believe your actions are inconsistent with our user agreements or policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of Zwift or others; and
  * In connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company.



We may also share aggregated information, which cannot reasonably be used to identify you.

##### Social Sharing Features

The Services may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools (such as the Facebook “Like” button), which let you share actions you take on our Services with other media _._ Your use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature.  For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the entities that provide these features.

##### Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others

We may allow others to provide analytics services and serve advertisements on our behalf across the internet and in applications. These entities may use cookies, web beacons, SDKs, device identifiers, and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and other websites and applications, including your IP address, web browser, mobile network information, pages viewed, time spent on pages or in apps, links clicked, and conversion information. This information may be used by Zwift and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our Services and other websites and better understand your online activity.

Your device may also include a feature (“Limit Ad Tracking” on iOS or “Opt Out of Interest-Based Ads” or “Opt Out of Ads Personalization” on Android) that allows you to opt out of having certain information collected through apps used for behavioral advertising purposes.

##### Data Retention

We store the information we collect about you for as long as is necessary for the purpose(s) for which we originally collected it. We may retain certain information for legitimate business purposes or as required by law.

##### Transfer of Information to the U.S. and Other Countries & Privacy Shield

Zwift is based in the United States and we process and store information in the United States.  Therefore, we and our service providers may transfer your information to, or store or access it in, jurisdictions that may not provide equivalent levels of data protection as your home jurisdiction.  We will take steps to ensure that your personal data receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it.
