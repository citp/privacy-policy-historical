This website contains links to websites owned and maintained by other companies. Such websites may also collect personal information and such collection of personal information will be subject to the privacy policies of the site and company at which it is collected. 

Information Collected via Marketing Activities   
ZWSOFT conducts many different marketing activities by which it may collect your personal information. For example, we collect contact information at trade shows, we rent email and physical mail addresses for marketing campaigns, we invite the public to download free software from our website in return for providing us contact information, we run contests for which participants provide basic information on registration, and we obtain addresses from publications that target the industries from which we hope to attract customers. When we rent lists of names and addresses, we rent them from entities that provide only names of individuals who have "opted in" to receive communications from companies such as ZWSOFT and we typically do not receive the actual contact information but only the ability to send an email or mail to the contact from a bonded mailhouse. 

Information Collected via License Activation and/or License Registration   
At the time customers register or activate their license of ZWCAD and/or ZW3D, ZWSOFT collects information such as Company name, shipping address, contact name, contact email address, telephone number, title, role, products designed, primary CAD product in use and industry sector. ZWSOFT requests this information because it believes it is important to understand who its customers are and how to contact them with relevant product information. In some circumstances, ZWSOFT may be obligated to make this information available to third parties who license to ZWSOFT technology that is included in the products being activated. If ZWSOFT receives an inquiry from a person at the licensee company as to which individual at the company has activated a given license, ZWSOFT will supply the contact name in response to enable the company to understand where its licenses are being used. 

The Use of Personal Information   
ZWSOFT may use the personal information you provide us for a variety of purposes, including registration, authentication, and marketing. We may use the information to inform you of special offers, contests, upgrades, and other ZWSOFT products and services that may be of interest to you. When you are a customer of ZWSOFT products or services, we may use your personal information to contact you for a wide array of customer relation/customer service purposes, such as to inquire whether you intend to renew subscription service agreements or other contracts with ZWSOFT or to request that you respond to a survey concerning our products and services or to address a question regarding an order.   
Since ZWSOFT resellers are our primary sales channel and provide the first line of support to our customers, we share personal contact information with the reseller assigned to a particular customer or prospect.   
We may also provide you with materials concerning the products and/or services of other third parties we think may be of interest to you. We may do this by emailing information to you or providing your name and address to a bonded mailhouse that mails information on behalf of a third party. The bonded mailhouse is prohibited from providing the third party with your name and contact information and is obligated to either return the information to us or destroy the list following the mailing. Unless we inform you otherwise at the point at which we collect your information, we will not provide your personal contact information directly to a third party not otherwise described herein. If you do not wish to receive information about additional ZWSOFT products or services or those of its partners and other companies, please let us know (contact information below) and we will respect your wishes. Emails we distribute describing offers we think may be of interest to you also contain instructions as to how you can opt-out of future emails.   
ZWSOFT stores the personal data of web site visitors and customers indefinitely and may maintain and process such information directly or indirectly in one or more databases in the United States and elsewhere. We may hire other companies to provide services on our behalf that may involve the storage and use of your personal information, such as for delivering mailings or emails.

At the time the order is placed we may ask you to "opt in" for further contact regarding such things as sales and special offers and we may contact you following that "opt in" permission. If you opt in we may also share your information with other companies and organizations whose products we think may be of interest to you so that they may contact you.
