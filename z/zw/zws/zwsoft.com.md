The data controller shall be ZWCAD SOFTWARE CO., LTD., 32nd floor, Zhujiang City, No. 15, West Zhujiang Road, Tianhe District, Guangzhou. For any privacy-related question, please contact privacy@zwsoft.com directly.

Legally, you do not need to provide ZWSOFT with the Personal Data described in this Privacy Statement. In addition, the contractual relationship you conclude with us by purchasing our Products does not imply an obligation to provide your Personal Data. However, if you do not provide us with certain data or object to the use of them, you may not be able to fully enjoy our services.

The legal Basis for Processing the Data

We will process your Personal Data according to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is a legal framework for the standardization of data protection within the EU. ZWSOFT shall mainly process data as a controller, for the purposes described in Section 1 and 2, which represent our legitimate interest in Article 6 (1) f) of the GDPR. At the same time, some Personal Data processed are necessary for us to enter into a contract or to take measures in accordance with your requirements before signing the contract. For example, if you want to purchase one of our Products, such as filling out the online form, we will process the submitted Personal Data to meet your requirements. It may include sharing your Personal Data with one of our authorized distributors, and then they will use your Personal Data to complete the purchase transaction. In addition, we are legally obligated to provide certain information to criminal prosecution or tax authorities in some cases as required. In these circumstances, we may take the legal requirement of Article 6(1) c) of GDPR or the public interest reason of Article 6(1) e) of GDPR as the legal basis.

Transmit Data to Areas outside the EU or the EEA

ZWSOFT operates mainly in China, which is the "Third Country" under the GDPR. Third Countries are widely considered unable to provide the data protection at the level same as the EU. However, ZWSOFT will provide you adequate level of protection as in these countries.

We guarantee that our service providers shall be certified according to the EU–U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and all Personal Data from the EU members shall be processed in line with the Privacy Shield Framework or we have entered into a contract with these states to provide an adequate level of protection for your data in strict accordance with the contract provisions. 

User Profiles

We will use your data for "Profiling". This means that we use your data to help us serve you, understand how users use our Websites, products and to provide and enhance your user experience. However, we will never process and analyze your Personal Data in the context of Profiling in a way that would lead to an automated decision legally binding upon you, or that would significantly impair you similarly.

Your right to process your Personal Data

As a natural person, you have certain rights of the “Data Subject”. According to the GDPR, you can claim for the following rights:

•   Your right to information and access under Article 15 GDPR,  
•   Your right to correction under Article 16 GDPR,  
•   Your right to erasure under Article 17 GDPR,  
•   Your right to restriction of processing under Article 18 GDPR, and  
•   Your right to data transferability under Article 20 GDPR.

In addition, according to Article 77 of GDPR, you will have the right to reject the competent data protection supervisory authority but only limited to the data processing conducted by ourselves, as the controller in our own name. If ZWSOFT acts as a third-party data processor, this right must be claimed with reference to the entity acting as the controller.

If you disagree, we will not process your personal data unless we can prove that it is far more than your interests, rights, and freedom or helpful for maintenance, exercise or defend legal claims.
