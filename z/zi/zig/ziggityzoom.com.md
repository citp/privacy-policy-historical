# Ziggity Zoom Privacy Statement | Ziggity Zoom

ZiggityZoom.com is committed to providing activities and entertainment online that are fun and educational in a safe environment. The following page discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices we follow at Ziggityzoom.com.

We ensure that our privacy policy and our information gathering and notification practices adhere to the U.S. Department of Commerce's Safe Harbor Principles. We are also committed to complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998.

  1. **The Information We Collect**  


At ZiggityZoom.com it is our policy to create online content that requires the collection of as little information as possible from our users. ZiggityZoom.com generally limits its collection of information to non-personal information, such as a username, password, a child's age, zip code and gender). The above information is collected when a parent registers to receive certain information (ex. Newsletter, coloring pages or educational worksheets).
ZiggityZoom.com offers parents the opportunity to sign up for our ZiggityZoom.com email newsletter. If a parent signs up for our email newsletter, we ask them to provide their email address. We send a confirmation email with his/her request to receive the ZiggityZoom.com newsletter via email on an ongoing basis and give them an option to be removed from our newsletter list. A parent can be removed from our newsletter email database at anytime by following the Unsubscribe instructions found in our email newsletters, as well as, by going to our Email Signup page and following the instructions on how to unsubscribe.
In some cases we may use a third party to deliver our email newsletter, therefore, all information collected for ZiggityZoom.com newsletters may be transferred, disclosed or shared with these third parties. The third parties may not use the information for other purposes and have agreed to maintain the confidentiality of the information.
ZiggityZoom.com may offer parents the opportunity to enter a contest. The parent may be asked to provide his/her first name and email address. All information collected for the contest is used only for the purpose of conducting the contest. After the contest if completed, we then delete any personal information collected in conjunction with the contest entry.
  2. **How the Information is Used**  


We do not ask or require any personal information to use ZiggityZoom.com. However, if a parent or guardian signs up for one of our newsletters, we will collect a username, and their email address.
  3. **With Whom the Information Will Be Shared**  


We do not disclose personally identifiable information to third parties. However, we may transfer, share or disclose such information with third parties who may need to have access to users' information needed to perform their role, but may not use it for any other purpose (ex. Send out email newsletter).
For those who purchase an item from our online store, it should be noted that we offer products through a third party and that all transactions and information are collected by the third party's online store and therefore is subject to the store's own privacy policy. We offer t-shirts, bags, mugs and other products through our store at CafePress ([Click here to see the Cafe Press Privacy Policy](http://www.cafepress.com/cp/info/help/privacy_policy.aspx "Click here to see the Cafe Press Privacy Policy"))
In the event that all or a portion of ZiggityZoom.com is sold to another entity, ZiggityZoom.com may transfer information collected from parents or guardians to the acquiring entity. If required, we may also disclose personally identifiable information to third parties when required by law or as pertaining to a government or judicial proceeding, or to protect ZiggityZoom.com and its users. In the event that ZiggityZoom.com has a change in ownership we will make an effort to email those parents and guardians who have registered their email address with us.
  4. **Children's Guidelines**  


At ZiggityZoom.com we do not require any user to sign up or give personal information to use the site at this time. When a user signs up for one of our newsletters we collect an email address, and username. We then send an email confirmation asking the parent to confirm the request for the newsletter signup.
