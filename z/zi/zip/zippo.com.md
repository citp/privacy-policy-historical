Zippo Manufacturing Company (Zippo) respects the privacy concerns of the users of its Internet Sites ("Sites"), and has created this privacy statement to explain what information we gather from your visit to our Sites, and how such information may be used.

Use of Information:

** As a general policy no personally identifiable information, such as your name, address or e-mail address, is automatically collected from your visit to Zippo Sites. However, certain non-personal information is recorded by the standard operation of Zippos Internet servers. Information such as the type of browser being used, its operating system, and your IP address is gathered in order to enhance your online experience.

Our Sites' various registration forms and surveys may request that you give us contact information (such as your name, mailing and/or e-mail address) demographic information (such as your age and gender) and profile data (such as your preferences in entertainment). Information submitted at the time of registration or submission may be used for marketing and promotional purposes by Zippo and its subsidiaries, and may be shared with our promotional partners (Zippo Partners). Personally identifiable information is never sold or leased to any third parties. With your permission, we may use your contact information to send you information about our companies. You may always opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the Choice/Opt-out section below. 

Our Sites use various order forms for you to request information, products, and services. We collect contact information (such as your name, mailing and/or e-mail address), and when appropriate, financial information (your credit card number) to process your request or purchase. Contact information from an order form is used to fulfill orders, and to provide information about our company to you if requested. The contact information is also used to get in touch with you when necessary regarding your order. Financial information that is collected is used to process your request for products and services, and will not be shared with third parties who are not involved with the transaction. When credit card information is transmitted, we use industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption. 

Zippo may disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe this information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference (either intentionally or unintentionally) with Zippo's rights or property, other Zippos web site users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. 

To the extent that any of our Sites accessible through the URL [www.zippo.com](http://www.zippo.com/) have additional or different practices or policies, these practices will be explained at that Site.

 ** **Security**:** Security for all personally identifiable information is extremely important to us. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Zippo cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.

 ** **For Parents Concerning Privacy**** : Zippo complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. 

****Use of Cookies:**** Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual's computer hard drive for record keeping purposes. Cookies make using our Sites easier by, among other things, saving your passwords and preferences for you. As an example, we use cookies to keep track of your shopping cart when you visit our online store, and help identify you when you return to the Store. These cookies are restricted for use only on our Sites, and do not transfer any personal information to any other party. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies; however, you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. (Note: you will need to consult the help area of your browser application for instructions.) If you choose to disable your cookies setting or refuse to accept a cookie, some parts of Zippo's web sites will not function properly or may be considerably slower. For example, without cookies, you will not be able to set personalized preferences or you may have difficulty completing shopping transactions, entering contests, or playing games.

 ** **Use of IP Addresses**** : An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet provider whenever you are surfing the Web. When you request pages from Zippo Sites, our servers log your IP address.

We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that your session will be logged, but you anonymous to us. We may use your IP addresses in cooperation with your Internet provider to identify you if we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our Terms of Use or to protect our service, Sites, customers, or others.
