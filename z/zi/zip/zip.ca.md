Contacting Us

When you subscribe to the Zip.ca DVD rental service or submit a purchase order for a DVD, we ask for your email address and a password, for your name, postal address, telephone number and a valid credit card number. We use this information to process your rental requests and to ship requested or ordered DVDs to you. We use your telephone number for the sole purpose of contacting you in the event of shipping or order-related issues, and not for marketing or other purposes. We request that you provide a valid credit card number during any Promotional Period period in the event that DVDs shipped during this period are not returned and monthly charges must be incurred until all outstanding rentals are returned or charges for lost or stolen DVDs are assessed. If you are paying by credit card, we continue to use the credit card number provided by you initially for billing purposes should you continue as a Zip.ca member following any Promotional Period. If you select the automatic debit payment option for your subscription, we will ask you for the name of your bank, your account number and other bank identifiers.

We use your email address to notify you that DVDs in your rental list or shopping cart have been shipped to you, to answer inquiries that you send to us, and to communicate with you when necessary concerning billing, the administration of your account and the processing of your rental or purchase requests. As these functions are necessary to the proper administration of your subscription account, we do not offer an opt-out from such email communication.

We track and retain your order history so that you can access the DVDs you have rented previously, and to remove shipped titles from your rental list. You can access your order history in the Your Account section of the website. This information is available to you alone and is not disclosed to other users, members or unaffiliated third parties.

We track and retain your purchase order history which is accessible in the Your Account section of the website. This information is available to you alone and is not disclosed to other users, members or unaffiliated third parties.

Our website contains a "Rating" feature where you can, at your option, rate any DVD in our library on a scale of 1 to 5. If you rate a movie you have rented, we use this information to personalize the Recommendations feature of the website that is accessible to you when you log in. If you do not wish to receive personalized recommendations, please do not use the "Ratings" feature. Subscribers who do not use the Ratings feature will receive standard Recommendations issued by Zip.ca.

Zip.ca also offers an Affiliate Program, where affiliate members direct customers to Zip.ca through links on their Web sites. We ask affiliate members for their site name (URL), mailing address, primary contact, pay-to address, technical contact, and other site-related information to determine whether a site will be included in our Affiliate Program. You can go to the Affiliate Program area for more details. The information collected from our affiliates is used strictly for that program; none of this information is used for general marketing purposes. In order to administer the Affiliate Program we log information from the URL of a referring website when members subscribe to Zip.ca. We do not use this information for any other purpose, nor do we disclose any Zip.ca member information to affiliate members.

When you register as a guest of Zip.ca in order to access our website, we ask for your name and email address.  We use your name and email address to track your visit to our website, to determine how many guests visit our website, and to assist you in the sign-up process should you decide to become a member of Zip.ca. This information is not disclosed to other users, members or unaffiliated third parties.

Share With a Friend Feature

You can use the Share With a Friend feature on the Zip.ca website to inform others about our services or website. We provide an email transmission for you to send for this purpose. While we facilitate this email transmission, we do not retain any text or the email address(es) to which you send when using this feature.

As a member or guest of Zip.ca, you may receive email communications from us that inform you about new DVDs, promote new or additional services or contain special offers from Zip.ca and our corporate affiliates in the Internet services sector. You may opt-out of receiving such email communications by adjusting your [Email Settings](http://www.zip.ca/MyAccount/EmailSettings.aspx) in My Account or by contacting member services.  If you do not opt-out, we will use your personal information for these purposes and may also disclose your email address and/or name to our corporate affiliates so that they can send you such information directly.

We retain your personal information, including contact account, shipping information, rental history and financial information, for the period that you remain a member, for the purposes described above, and following the termination or suspension of your rental membership for such further periods as required by applicable laws or limitation periods and as necessary to allow us to guard against fraud and unauthorized further free trials or other promotions. In the event you decide to reactivate your account with Zip.ca, you may be prompted to confirm your personal information at that time if your personal information continues to be retained by Zip.ca for the purposes described above.

Zip.ca is not responsible for how such third parties collect, use or disclose your personal information, so it is important to familiarize yourself with the privacy policies of these websites before providing your personal information on those sites.
