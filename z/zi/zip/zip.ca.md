### How We Collect and Use Your Personal Information

We at Zip.ca ("Zip", "we", "our", "us") respect and are committed to protecting our users ("you", "yourself", "your") privacy, and to making sure you know how we collect, use and disclose your personal information. By creating a free Zip.ca account, subscribing to a Zip.ca Mail plan or renting from a Zip.ca Kiosk, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

We recommend that you take the time to read this Privacy Policy so that you understand how we handle and process personal information provided when you use Zip.ca. As we develop and expand our services, this Privacy Policy may also change. We will include a "last amended" date on the Policy as displayed on the website. We strongly encourage you to refer back to the Privacy Policy periodically. 

You can contact us if you have a question about our Privacy Policy or want to change or update your personal information at any time. For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, "personal information" means information about an identifiable individual, but does not include the name, title or business address or telephone number of an employee of an organization. Zip.ca will not collect, use or disclose your personal information in a way that is incompatible with this Privacy Policy.

Only those Zip.ca employees who have a legitimate business purpose for accessing the personal information collected are authorized to do so. Unauthorized access to or use of personal information by an employee is prohibited and constitutes grounds for disciplinary action. In addition, our management systems are configured so as to block or restrict employee access from those without access privileges.

In the event that certain services provided to you by or through Zip.ca or one of its business partners are to be provided to you by a substitute service provider, your information may be transferred to the substitute service provider provided that such substitute entity agrees to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy in effect at the time of performance of the services.

Zip.ca may also disclose personal information about account holders to a third party if a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order legally requires or authorizes us to do so, to enforce and protect the terms and conditions of our agreement(s) with you or the Terms of Use applicable to our website, or to collect on outstanding accounts.

Zip.ca also reserves the right to disclose and/or transfer personal information to a third party in the event of a proposed or actual purchase, sale, lease, merger, amalgamation or any other type of acquisition, disposal or financing of all or any portion of Zip.ca or of any of the business or assets or shares of Zip.ca, provided the third party represents that it will continue to use the information for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy and in accordance with applicable privacy protection laws.
