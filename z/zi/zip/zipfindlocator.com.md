During the course of service to your business we may collect corporately identifiable information such as: an IP address, a contact name, email address, or other information you volunteer. It is your choice to divulge this information and we encourage you to verify its accuracy. This information is dealt with confidentially, and used for internal purposes throughout our service to you. Residual information is retained within our archival system. 

A "cookie" is a small portion of data that is sent from a web server to your browser and subsequently stored on your computer's hard drive. Various sites use this device to track information about you, providing customization of services. Though useful, only our OFAC Online product web sites currently employ this device. 

We have security measures in place to further protect your corporately/individually identifying information. Credit Card transactions/information submitted via the Internet using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) are encrypted and are not sold, rented, or leased to a third party.

Be aware that the sites and pages that you may link to from these web pages may collect information from you, and the practices of those web sites, use of cookies etc., are not covered under this disclosure. We advocate that you read their privacy disclosures, in order to be further aware of what information is collected about you and how it is used.

We thank you for choosing us to service you. We want you to be aware that when you purchase the [ZIPFind® Locator](http://www.findlocation.com/) web based dealer locator system, or if you place an ad on our [AgDirect](http://www.agdirect.com/) pages, that both require us to make certain portions of your corporately identifying information public (such as your company name and business address). This is accomplished to further your business objectives by giving prospective customers an ability to contact you.

There may be times when we make general statistics or our Client List available to a third party who is a prospective customer or business partner (excluding exempting licensing agreements with us). However, we do not rent, lease, trade, or sell the individually/corporately identifiable information that we collect. If we choose to do so in the future, we will only do so with trustworthy third parties, and will disclose these changes to you by posting the modified policy at: <http://www.link-usa.com/PrivacyDisclosure.htm>

It Is Your Choice  
Linking to our web site, engaging in email correspondence, sharing any identifiable information with us, and engaging us in service for you is a choice you make. Unfortunately, nothing on the Internet can be guaranteed 100%, so we encourage you to use discretion and proceed at your own risk as you make these choices. 

Please be advised that there may be occasions where we are legally required to disclose information, such as in response to a legally permitted inquiry. We reserve the right to change and modify our policies, disclosures, and privacy statement, at any time and in order to keep you aware of those changes, we will post the most current privacy disclosure at: <http://www.link-usa.com/PrivacyDisclosure.htm>
