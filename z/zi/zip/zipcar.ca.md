## What is personal information?

Personal information means information that identifies you as an individual, or that we can combine with readily available information to identify you as an individual. 

## What personal information we collect and how we use it

The principal purposes for which we collect and store your personal and financial information are to process your application, allow you to reserve and use our vehicles, authorize payment, bill you, respond to your inquiries, improve and communicate with you about our products and services and maintain your account with us. 

**When you visit the Zipcar websites, mobile sites and applications,** our servers automatically log certain information about your use of our websites, mobile sites and applications ("sites") such as your IP address, your browser type, operating system and browser language. We also collect information about your activities on our sites, such as the pages you visit or the ads or links you click on. When you visit a Zipcar site, Zipcar places a cookie on your computer or device. These cookies enable us to measure the effectiveness of content on the sites and refine and tailor that content to suit our visitors' interests. If you have joined Zipcar, you can agree to accept a cookie to allow Zipcar to remember you when you visit our sites. To learn more about cookies and how Zipcar customizes the content and offers for you, please see **"Advertising and Personalized Content"** below. 

**Zipcar collects information that you voluntarily submit to us** , such as your name, email address, postal address or telephone number, if you include that information in your profile or provide it via an email, or text message sent to us or that you tell us over the telephone or by other means. Your telephone calls and other communications with us may be recorded or monitored for quality control, training and similar purposes. By using these communication methods you are consenting to the recording or monitoring of your calls and communications with Zipcar. 

**If you apply to join Zipcar** , we collect personal and financial information as you proceed through the stages of our online application, membership agreement and reservation process. In addition to your name and contact information, we will also collect your driver's license number and the jurisdiction in which you are registered and credit card or other payment information. We may also collect information such as your driving record from you, regulatory bodies where you live, and from third parties. This information is used to process your application and for the purposes described below. 

**If you join Zipcar and use our services** , we collect information about your reservations (dates, times, locations, etc.) and your use of the Zipcar service (return time, mileage, accidents, etc.). We use this information to bill you, respond to your inquiries, provide and improve our products and services and maintain your account with us, to personalize your Zipcar experience (e.g., by understanding your preferences), and to provide content and offers that we think may be of interest to you. To learn more about how Zipcar customizes content and offers please see **"Advertising and Personalized Content"** below. From time to time we may send commercial communications. To edit your preferences, please go to your account settings page. 

**Zipcars may be equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS) vehicle tracking technology.** GPS is a network of satellites that allows us to determine the location (latitude and longitude) of Zipcars during your reservation. This information is transmitted to Zipcar and stored (including while it is hired to you). Zipcar uses this information for a variety of important purposes. For example, we may use GPS data to help you find a car you have reserved, to provide roadside assistance when you need it, to assist in making a car available at the place and time you have reserved, to alert us when a Zipcar is likely to be returned late and to locate lost or stolen Zipcars. We do not actively track or monitor vehicle location, and we generally do not store historical GPS data. 

**Refer a Friend.** If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Zipcar stores this information for the purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at [privacy@zipcar.com](mailto:privacy@zipcar.com) to request that we remove this information from our database; however, if someone else subsequently refers the same friend, their email address may be stored again. 

## Children's privacy

We do not knowingly solicit or collect individually identifying information from children under the age of 13. 

## Where we hold personal information

Zipcar maintains servers within the European Union and in the United States of America. Please note that the laws governing the processing of personal information in the United States of America may not be as rigorous as they are in your home country. By joining Zipcar and using our services, you consent to the transfer of your personal and financial information outside of the European Economic Area or your home the country, as applicable, for the purposes described in this privacy notice.

##  To what third parties might we transfer personal information? 

Except as described in this privacy notice, Zipcar will not share your personal information with third parties outside the Zipcar group unless it is necessary to provide the Zipcar service, fulfill a transaction you have requested, or in other circumstances with your consent. We do however disclose your personal information within the Zipcar group and to contractors, advisors, consultants and service providers acting on our behalf or under our instructions, including for purposes relating to the provision, operation, maintenance, administration, promotion, improvement, and oversight of our services, sites and advertising services, or to fulfill your requests for information or service. If you apply for Zipcar membership, some of the information you supply may be shared with regulatory bodies where you live and/or service providers we utilize to obtain your driving record from such regulatory bodies. We do not share your personal information with such regulatory bodies or service providers beyond what is necessary to approve your application. In addition, if you are associated or affiliated with another, primary account (for example, if you are an associate member or affiliated with a business's or university's account), the primary account holder or administrator of that account may have access to certain information regarding your account or use of our services. 

We may disclose your personal information in connection with a corporate transaction, proceeding, or reorganization involving the business activities for which the information is maintained. In the event that ownership of Zipcar or its business was to change as a result of a merger, acquisition or transfer to another company, your personal information may be shared or transferred. If such a sharing or transfer results in a material change in the way your personal information is used, we will provide notice about the choices you have to decline to permit such sharing or transfer. 

Zipcar may disclose your personal information, including location/GPS data, in response to legal process (for example, a court order, search warrant or subpoena) or requests from law enforcement authorities; in other circumstances in which Zipcar believes the sites, the Zipcar service or our vehicles are being or has been used in violation of our policies, applicable law or otherwise in the commission of a crime; when we have a good faith belief that there is an emergency that poses a threat to the safety of you or another person; or when necessary to protect the rights or property of Zipcar or third parties.

Each independent licensee may collect personal information and use the personal information for its own purposes. Zipcar does not control the independent licensee's use of personal information. For credit card transactions, the independent licensee - not Zipcar – may collect and process credit card information and receive payment for the Zipcar services. In this case, the independent licensee is subject to the merchant rules of the credit card processors it selects. This privacy notice also does not apply to any independent licensee's website.
