<p class="textsubheader"><font color="#000000">Processing of Orders and Subscriptions</font></p>
<p class="textbody"><font color="#000000">When you subscribe to the Zip.ca DVD rental service or submit a purchase order for a DVD, we ask for your email address and a password, for your name, postal address, telephone number and a valid credit card number. We use this information to process your rental requests and to ship requested or ordered DVDs to you. We use your telephone number for the sole purpose of contacting you in the event of shipping or order-related issues, and not for marketing or other purposes. We request that you provide a valid credit card number during any Promotional Period period in the event that DVDs shipped during this period are not returned and monthly charges must be incurred until all outstanding rentals are returned or charges for lost or stolen DVDs are assessed. If you are paying by credit card, we continue to use the credit card number provided by you initially for billing purposes should you continue as a Zip.ca member following any Promotional Period. If you select the automatic debit payment option for your subscription, we will ask you for the name of your bank, your account number and other bank identifiers.</font></p>
<p class="textbody"><font color="#000000">We use your email address to notify you that DVDs in your rental list or shopping cart have been shipped to you, to answer inquiries that you send to us, and to communicate with you when necessary concerning billing, the administration of your account and the processing of your rental or purchase requests. As these functions are necessary to the proper administration of your subscription account, we do not offer an opt-out from such email communication.</font></p>
<p class="textsubheader"><font color="#000000">Rental History</font></p>

You can go to the Affiliate Program area for more details. The information collected from our affiliates is used strictly for that program; none of this information is used for general marketing purposes.
