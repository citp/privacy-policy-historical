      <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
      <h5>User-Provided Information:</h5>
      <p>You provide us information about yourself, such as your name and e-mail address and phone number, if you register for an account with or respond to a post on or through the Service.  If you correspond with us by email, we may retain the content of your email messages, your email address and our responses.  We may also retain any messages you send through the Service.  You may provide us information in User Content you post to the Service.</p>

The additional information we may collect is as follows; information about candidates such as their name, email address, phone number, resume, experience, education, country and zip code.  You may also export your candidates to an excel spreadsheet to make it easier to manage.

      <h5>Cookies Information:</h5>
      <p>When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets ZipRecruiter help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site.  A cookie may also convey anonymous information about how you browse the Service to us.  A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser's directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.</p>

      <h5>Log File Information:</h5>
      <p>Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page.  When you use the Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.</p>

      <h5>Clear Gifs Information:</h5>
      <p>When you use the Service, ZipRecruiter or our third party analytics providers may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously and help us better manage content on our site by informing us of what content is effective.   No personally identifiable information from your ZipRecruiter account is collected using these clear gifs.  In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients.  The information is used to enable more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our marketing, and make ZipRecruiter better for our users.</p>

      <h5>Third Party Services:</h5>
      <p>ZipRecruiter uses third party analytics service to help understand use of the Service. These third party analytics services collect the information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, including cookies and your IP address. Their use of this information is governed by their Privacy Policy.</p>

      <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
      <p>We use the personal information you submit to create your account, allow you to add candidates and other users, operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service.  We use this information to allow you to better manage who is able to access the service, view resumes, set up resume alerts (which you may turn off at any time by logging into your account), view posted jobs, view archived jobs, create a new job, rate candidates, view receipts, determine who may be the right fit as a candidate for the positions you have open, and to contact you in response to your inquiries.</p>

[You also agree that we may send you notifications of activity on the Service to the email address you give us, in accordance with any applicable privacy settings.]  We may use your email address to send you other messages, such as newsletters, changes to features of the Service, or special offers.

Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers.  You may not opt out of Service-related e-mails. </p>

      <p>If you choose to use our invitation service to invite a friend to the service, we provide you with a link to copy and paste to share with your friends, or spread the word on linkedin, facebook or twitter. &nbsp;We provide you with a unique link ID so that you earn credit for each friend that joins the site by following your link. Your friend may contact us to request that we remove this information from our database at <a href="mailto:privacy@ziprecruiter.com">privacy@ziprecruiter.com</a>.</p>

      <p>If you wish to invite a friend to view our blog posts we will ask you for that person's email address and automatically send an email invitation.

We reserve the right to remove any such information or material for any reason or no reason, including without limitation if in our sole opinion such information or material violates, or may violate, any applicable law or our Terms of Use Agreement, or to protect or defend our rights or property or those of any third party.  ZipRecruiter also reserves the right to remove information upon the request of any third party.</p>

      <p>We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems reported by our Users or engineers that are associated with certain IP addresses; (f) help you efficiently access your information after you sign in; and (h) track User Content and Users to the extent necessary to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act; and (i) automatically update the ZipRecruiter application on your devices.</p>

      <h3>How We Share Your Information</h3>
      <h5>Personally Identifiable Information:</h5>
      <p>ZipRecruiter will not rent or sell your personally identifiable information with third parties other than as disclosed within this privacy policy. ZipRecruiter may share your personally identifiable information with third parties for the purpose of providing the Service to you. The types of third parties who we may share your personally identifiable information are credit card processing company, customer service provider, and an email service provider.  If we do this, such third parties' use of your information will be bound by this Privacy Policy. We may store personal information in locations outside the direct control of ZipRecruiter (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).</p>

      <p>Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User Content, becomes available to the public.  If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if other Users have copied or saved that information. If you respond to a job posting on the Service, we will share your response with the Employer that posted the job.</p>

      <p>From time to time, we may run contests, special offers, or other events or activities ("Events") on the Service together with a third party partner.  If you provide information to such third parties, you give them permission to use it for the purpose of that Event and any other use that you approve. We cannot control third parties' use of your information. If you do not want your information to be collected by or shared with a third party, you can choose not to participate in these Events.</p>

      <p>As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution. You will be notified via email and/or prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.</p>

      <p>Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, ZipRecruiter will not disclose personal information to any third party unless required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law, comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce our <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of ZipRecruiter, our Users or others.</p>

      <h5>Non-Personally Identifiable Information:  </h5>
      <p>We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to help them understand the usage patterns for certain ZipRecruiter services.</p>

      <p>ZipRecruiter may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve advertisements on the Service. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on ZipRecruiter. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content.  ZipRecruiter does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks ZipRecruiter to show an advertisement to a certain audience and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.  In addition, third-party advertisers may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, see http://preferences-mgr.trustee.com<a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html">Google Privacy Center</a> or <a href="http://networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">The NAI Tool to Opt Out of Behavioral Advertising</a>.  The ZipRecruiter Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers.  Please consult the respective privacy policies of such advertisers for more information.</p>
