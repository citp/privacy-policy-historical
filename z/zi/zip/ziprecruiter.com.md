# Privacy Policy | ZipRecruiter

This Privacy Policy describes how ZipRecruiter.com handles personal information for the services on the ZipRecruiter websites and other related websites ("the Sites"). By using the Sites, you expressly consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.

You may be able to browse the Sites without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. If you choose to provide us with personal information, you consent to the transfer and storage of that information to our servers located in the United States.

We may collect and store: (1) email address, physical contact information, and financial information, such as credit card or bank account numbers; (2) transactional information based on your activities on the Sites (such as marketing, buying, or selling products, and the content you generate or that relates to your account); (3) shipping, billing and other information you provide to purchase or ship an item; (4) community discussions, chats, postings, correspondence through the Sites, and correspondence sent to us; (5) computer sign-on data, statistics on page views, traffic to and from the Sites, and advertisement data; (6) other information, including IP address and standard web log information, and (7) supplemental information from third parties. For example, if the information you provide cannot be verified, we may ask you to send us additional information (such as your driver's license, credit card statement, or other information), or to answer additional questions to help verify your information. 

We may combine your information with information we collect from other individuals or companies (such as demographic data) to improve and personalize our services. If you do not wish to receive marketing communications from us, simply indicate your preference once you sign-in on ZipRecruiter, or modify your account page, or follow directions to opt-out within an email. 

We store and process your information on computers located in the United States that are protected by physical as well as technological security devices. You can access and modify the information you provide us and choose not to receive certain communications by signing-in to your account. If you object to your information being used in this way, do not use our services.

You agree that we may use your personal information to: (1) provide services and customer support; (2) resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems; (3) prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and enforce our [Terms of Service Agreement](https://web.archive.org/terms); (4) customize, track, and modify our services and the Sites' content and layout; (5) contact you about marketing, service updates, and promotional offers; and (6) verify information for accuracy, including with third parties as appropriate. 

We may disclose your personal information to respond to legal requirements, enforce our policies, respond to claims that content violates the rights of others, or protect anyone's rights, property, or safety.

We may also share your personal information with: (1) marketing affiliates; (2) service providers who help perform our business operations (such as website hosting, fraud investigations, and bill collection); (3) other third parties to whom you ask us to send your information; and (4) other business entities, should we merge with or be acquired by that business entity. 

Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and our ability to keep the Sites free from abuse, we will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement, other government officials, or other third parties without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity.

Some personal information is displayed on certain web pages of ZipRecruiter and may therefore be available to the public. Your activities on the Sites may be traceable to you. Other people may see your products and services, feedback, ratings and associated comments, and similar information. Notices may be sent to other ZipRecruiter members regarding suspicious activity and policy violations on the Sites and refer to your personal information and specific products or services. 

ZipRecruiter Sites enable you to share personal and other information in order to facilitate your transactions. We cannot guarantee the privacy or security of your information and therefore we encourage you to evaluate the privacy and security policies of those other companies before entering into a transaction and choosing to share your information. When users are involved in a transaction, they may have access to each other's name, personal information, email address, and other contact information. 

You agree to use user information only for: (1) ZipRecruiter transaction-related purposes that are not unsolicited commercial messages; (2) using services offered through ZipRecruiter (e.g. fraud complaints), or (3) other purposes that a user expressly chooses. 

ZipRecruiter uses "cookies" (small files placed on your hard drive) on certain pages of the Sites to help analyze our web page flow, and customize our services. With respect to cookies, you are advised that: (1) certain features are only available through the use of cookies; (2) cookies help identify you and maintain your signed-in status; (3) some cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session; (4) you may decline our cookies if your browser permits, although doing so may interfere with your use of the Sites; (5) you may encounter cookies from third parties on certain pages of the Sites that we do not control. (For example, if you view a web page created or linked by another user, there may be a "cookie" placed by that web page.) 

Use unique numbers, letters, and special characters and do not disclose your ZipRecruiter password, if any, to anyone. If you do share your password or your personal information with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions taken in the name of your account. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately notify ZipRecruiter and change your password.

Once you make a public posting, you may not be able to change or remove it. We retain personal information from closed accounts in order to comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our ZipRecruiter Terms of Service Agreement, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law. 

We treat data as an asset that must be protected and may use tools (encryption, passwords, physical security, etc.) to protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the Sites. Therefore, although we try to protect your privacy, we cannot promise that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.

This Privacy Policy is effective upon use of the Sites for new users and is otherwise effective on January 1, 2010. We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended terms on the Sites. All amended terms automatically take effect 30 days after they are initially posted on the Sites. In addition, we may notify you in accordance with your account preferences.
