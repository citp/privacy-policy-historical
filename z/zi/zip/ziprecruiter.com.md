Where permitted by applicable law, we may share your Non-Personal Data for any purpose not prohibited by applicable law or inconsistent with this Privacy Policy or any written representation we have made to you at the point and time of the data collection.

### 7) WHERE YOUR DATA IS TRANSFERRED top

We transfer Non-Personal Data in accordance with applicable laws. We share your Personal Data within the ZipRecruiter Group as permitted by applicable law. This means that the Personal Data that we collect from you may be transferred to, accessed in, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area. In such event, we ensure your Personal Data is protected by requiring companies within the ZipRecruiter Group to follow the same rules when processing your Personal Data. These rules are called "binding corporate rules". Many of our external third-parties are based outside the EEA so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.

### 8) HOW LONG YOUR DATA WILL BE KEPT top

We will not retain your Personal Data for longer than necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. Different retention periods apply for different types of Personal Data and in determining the appropriate retention period, we consider several criteria, including, but not limited to, the purpose for which we hold your Personal Data, our legal, accounting, reporting and/or regulatory obligations in relation to that Personal Data, e.g., financial or tax reporting obligations, whether our relationship with you is ongoing, e.g., where you use more than one of our products and/or services, any specific request you may have made in relation to the deletion of your Personal Data, or where we have a legitimate interest in relation to the management of our own rights, e.g., the defence of any claims. In some circumstances we may anonymize your Personal Data so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case we may use such information without further notice to you. Once you no longer have a relationship with us, we will retain and securely destroy your Personal Data subject to the foregoing and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. If you request to receive no further contact from us, we will keep some basic information about you on our suppression list in order to avoid sending you unwanted materials in the future.

### 9) YOUR DATA SUBJECT ACCESS RIGHTS (for data subjects in the EEA) top

Data subjects in the EEA have the following rights with respect to their Personal Data:

YOUR RIGHTS | WHAT YOU CAN REQUEST  
---|---  
Right to **Information** | The right to know what Personal Data we hold about you and how we use it.  
Right to **Access** | The right to be provided with a copy of your Personal Data (subject to certain restrictions).

If you have a user account with us, you also have the option of correcting your information directly in your account.  
Right to **erasure/be forgotten** | This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Data where there is no good reason for us to continue to process it. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request for erasure and in such circumstances, will notify our reasons to you.  
Right to **restrict processing** | The right to require us to restrict processing of your Personal Data, i.e., you can request that we suspend the processing of your Personal Data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.  
Right to **request data portability** | In certain circumstances, you have the right to request the transfer of your Personal Data to you or to a third party in a commonly used machine-readable format. Note, however, that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.  
Right to **object to processing** | You have the right to object to the processing of your Personal Data in the following circumstances: (i) at any time to your Personal Data being processed for direct marketing (including profiling); or (ii) in certain other situations, to our continued processing of your Personal Data, e.g., our processing of your Personal Data when such processing is based on our legitimate interests. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.

**_Method for Requesting Information Pursuant to Your Rights_**

Upon request, ZipRecruiter will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. If you would like to exercise any of the data subject access rights in the table above (each, an “ _Access Request_ ”) please send an email to [dsars@ziprecruiter.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20181226081129id_/https%3A//www.ziprecruiter.com/dsars@ziprecruiter.com), and we will send you a Data Subject Access Request Form. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.

**_No Fee Usually Required_**

You will not usually be required to pay a fee to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of the other rights).  However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

**_What We May Need from You_**

Once we receive your Access Request, we may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of your other rights).  This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

**_Time Limit to Respond_**

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.  Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
