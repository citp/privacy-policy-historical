**What general information is collected and how it is used.**

When you visit zipRealty.com, our computer system, like most, will automatically log some basic information about you and your computer, including, but not limited to, your IP address, operating system and browser software. We use this information for routine maintenance and to gather broad demographic information to help us decide how better to implement our web site.

We use cookies. Cookies are used to store a session ID for tracking users as they move through the web site after logging on. The cookies are not linked to personally identifiable information. If a user does not accept cookies, they will not be able to register on our web site or re-log in as a registered user.

**With whom personally identifiable information is shared.**

We recognize that the information we collect from you may, in itself, or when tied together with other information, identify you as a specific individual. Your account information and personal data is maintained by zipRealty.com in order to fulfill our legal and regulatory requirements and to provide you with the information, products and services you have requested. As a general rule, zipRealty.com will not disclose your personal information to any third party except with your permission or under special circumstances, as discussed below.

zipRealty.com will disclose to interested parties information pertaining to the sale of a house listed in our database. This information will be posted on our web site and in the local Multiple Listing Service (MLS) for the purpose of marketing the home to the greatest number of potential buyers.

By requesting information or services from zipRealty.com, you give zipRealty.com permission to transfer your information, as necessary, to the appropriate parties, such as the title insurer, loan underwriter, appraiser, or inspector you select, so that they can fulfill your request and provide you with the services you require. All Online Agents are employees of zipRealty.com. All personally identifiable information you provide to zipRealty.com will be made available to your Online Agent. Generally, your Online Agent will coordinate the disclosure of your information to third parties. This will be done in much the same way as a traditional Real Estate Agent shares information with third parties. For example, your Online Agent may disclose your name and the address of the property you want to purchase to a building inspector when you request our assistance in arranging an inspection of the property. Your Online Agent will also share certain information with zipRealty.com Field Service Agents who will assist you in viewing properties.

The various lending institutions, title companies and other service providers involved in your real estate transaction may each have their own privacy policies governing how they handle your personally identifiable information. We endeavor to review these other policies in order to ensure that the philosophies and values of our affiliates are in alignment with our own. However, zipRealty.com accepts no responsibility or liability for third party privacy policies or the actions of any third party with respect to your personally identifiable information. 

zipRealty.com does conduct research on our users' demographics, interests and behavior based on the information provided by the user and from our server log files. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis only. For example, we may review how many users are women, or the average price range of our users. zipRealty.com may share this aggregated data with our business affiliates or, if required by law, any government agency. However, we will not sell or lease personally identifying information to any third party.

If you came to our website through a link on eBay's website ("eBay Referred Users"), zipRealty.com may provide eBay reasonably requested aggregated and personally identifiable data. zipRealty.com has also agreed to provide eBay reasonable access to its database of eBay Referred Users in order to support communication with and surveys of the eBay Referred Users.

zipRealty.com may disclose personally identifiable information in certain circumstances when we have reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to contact, identify or bring legal action against someone who may be intentionally or unintentionally causing injury to or interference with our rights or property, our users, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. We may disclose personally identifiable information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative or other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain and improve our products and services.

Our web site provides links to other web sites. Please be aware that when you click on one of these links, you are going to another web site even though the zipRealty.com logo, banner, or tool bar may still be visible.
