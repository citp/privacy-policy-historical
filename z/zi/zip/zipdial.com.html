<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<div class="">
<h4>ZipDial Mobile Solutions Pvt. Ltd.</h4>
<p>ZipDial knows that you, the user, care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy  policy. By visiting ZipDial’s web site [www.zipdial.com], submitting information or using any of  our services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy  Policy.
					</p>
<p></p></div>
<div class="">
<h4>What does this privacy policy cover?</h4>
<p>This Privacy Policy covers ZipDial’s treatment of your personally identifiable information  (“Personal Information”) that ZipDial gathers when you are accessing ZipDial’s web site or  when you use ZipDial’s services. The types of Personal Information collected may include your  full name, address, e-mail address, phone or other communication device number and other  data related to your account (including contact lists and preferences). Also, this Policy covers  ZipDial’s treatment of any Personal Information that ZipDial’s business partners or customers  share with ZipDial. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that ZipDial does  not own or control, or to individuals that ZipDial does not employ or manage.
					</p>
<p></p></div>
<div class="">
<h4>What Personal Information does ZipDial collect?</h4>
<p>The information we gather from users enables us to personalize and improve our services. We collect the following types of information from our users.
					</p>
<p></p></div>
<div class="">
<h4>Personal Information you provide to us.</h4>
<p>We may receive and store any information you enter on our web site or in connection with our  services or that you provide to us in any other way. It is important to note that we only store  Personal Information provided to use ZipDial services. For example, if you link your mobile  number to your Twitter account through ZipDial, we do not store your Twitter password; it is  only used by Twitter to authorize a one-time linkage with ZipDial. The Personal Information  you provide may be used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain services,  customizing the content you see, and communicating with you about the services and anything  else that you might opt-in for.
					</p>
<p></p></div>
<div class="">
<h4>Personal Information collected automatically.</h4>
<p>We may receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our web  site or services. ZipDial may choose to automatically receive and record information on our  server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you  requested. ZipDial may also choose to automatically collect information from your use of the  services, including account activity (e.g. storage use, number of log-ins, number of calls, phone  numbers dialed), data displayed and clicked on, and other usage information (e.g. the identity  of your mobile operator, your mobile subscriber circle, subscription and response data while  using ZipDial services). This type of data allows us to improve and personalize our services and  content delivered to you. ZipDial will not share any of your Personal Information including  mobile number, individual profile information, individual usage data or any data generated while  linking third party services through ZipDial, with any third party, business partner or customer  of ZipDial that did not previously store such information, except as described below. As part of  this use of information, we may provide aggregate, not individual specific, information to our  partners about how our users and customers, collectively, use our site and mobile services and  about the collective responses and opinions of our users and customers as expressed through use  of our services.
					</p>
<p></p></div>
<div class="">
<h4>Communications</h4>
<p>We may receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail or text message if your computer or phone or other communication device supports this type of program. We may also compare our  user and/or customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending  unnecessary messages to our users. If you have subscribed to any ZipDial mobile services,  ZipDial will provide you a toll free number to dial in and OPT OUT of the service. You may  dial that number at any time if you wish to discontinue receiving SMS communications for a  particular ZipDial service.. ZipDial fully supports and complies with TRAI regulations regarding  SMS services, notifying customers at least every 6 months of how they may opt out of an SMS  alerts service.
					</p>
<p></p></div>
<div class="">
<h4>What About Cookies?</h4>
<p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we may transfer to your computer’s hard drive through  your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages  in our site and on our service are visited and by how many people. ZipDial cookies do not  collect Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through  cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are or to identify your screen name  or e-mail address. Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will  prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of  your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of<br>
						ways.
					</p>
<p></p></div>
<div class="">
<h4>Will ZipDial share any of the Personal Information it receives?</h4>
<p>Personal Information about our users is an integral part of our business. We neither rent nor  sell your Personal Information to anyone. We may share your Personal Information only with  your consent to our customers in respect of whom you have chosen, or in respect of whom you  have acted upon, to use the services of ZipDial (For example, if you dial a ZipDial number after  seeing an ad for company X that says something such as ‘ZipDial 080xxxxxxxx and we’ll call you back’ or ‘ZipDial 080xxxxxxxx for more information’ you are providing consent to ZipDial  to share your phone number to company X) or to business partners and affiliates as described  below:
					</p>
<p><strong>Agents: </strong>We may employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need  to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you  differently, ZipDial’s agents do not have any right to use Personal Information we share with  them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal  Information for the above purpose.
					</p>
<p><strong>Business partners and customers: </strong>In some cases we may enter into business partnership  arrangements wherein we will share your Personal Information with such partner only to enable  such partner to integrate its technology with ZipDial’s technology and render its own services  bundled with our services. This would include services like Customer Feedback, where you have  already provided your Personal Information to a ZipDial customer. Unless you are previously  notified, all business partners will treat your information in the same manner as ZipDial under  this policy. However, ZipDial is not responsible for monitoring or enforcing each customer’s handling  of your Personal Information. As for our customers, in cases where you utilize the services of  ZipDial pursuant to any advertisement of any of ZipDial’s customer to know more about the  advertising customer or his/its products/services, your Personal Information may be shared  with such customer of ZipDial as already detailed previously. Each customer is responsible for  following TRAI rules protecting against further contact and spamming.
					</p>
<p><strong>Business Transfers: </strong>In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types  of transactions, user / customer information is typically one of the business assets that is  transferred. Moreover, if ZipDial, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, user / customer  information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You  acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of ZipDial may continue to  use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.
					</p>
<p><strong>Protection of ZipDial and Others: </strong>We may release Personal Information when we believe in  good faith that release is necessary to comply with any law or regulation; enforce or apply our  terms of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of ZipDial, our  employees, our customers, or others.
					</p>
<p><strong>Compliance with law enforcement and judicial authorities: </strong>We shall be bound to disclose  Personal Information in response to a request/summons from a law enforcement authority; a  court of law; or a quasi-judicial body.
					</p>
<p></p></div>
<div class="">
<h4>What choices do I have?</h4>
<p>As stated previously, you can always unsubscribe (opt-out) from any ZipDial services which you were previously using. As explained earlier, the majority of browsers allow you to monitor and restrict our use of  cookies. Please note, however, that if your browser does not accept cookies, you may not be able  to take advantage of some of our services or web site features.
					</p>
<p></p></div>
<div class="">
<h4>Effective date of this privacy policy</h4>
<p>This policy is effective from the date you access this Privacy Policy or the services of ZipDial. All personal and confidential information collected is maintained and treated in the manner set  forth in this policy. If you disagree with the treatment of your personal information as per this  policy, please immediately refrain from using the services on www.zipdial.com and unsubscribe  from the services.
					</p>
<p></p></div>
<div class="">
<h4>Changes to this privacy policy</h4>
<p>ZipDial may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect is  subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. If we make  changes thereby diluting the stringency in the way we use Personal Information, we will notify  you by posting an announcement on our web site.
