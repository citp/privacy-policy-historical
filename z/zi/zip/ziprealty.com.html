Depending on the services you request, this personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to, your name, address, zip code, e-mail address, telephone number, and information about the properties in which you are interested.

 <li> <font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" size="2"> <b>Purchase Negotiations</b>

 This information will include such items as the title and escrow company you
 would like to use, what inspections you will require or waive, what warranties
 you will require or waive, the amount of any deposits you will make, and your

<p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" size="2"> We recognize that the information
 we collect from you may, in itself, or when tied together with other information,
 identify you as a specific individual. Your account information and personal
 data is maintained by zipRealty.com in order to fulfill our legal and regulatory
 requirements and to provide you with the information, products and services
 you have requested. As a general rule, zipRealty.com will not disclose your
 personal information to any third party except with your permission or under
 special circumstances, as discussed below.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" size="2"> zipRealty.com will
 disclose to interested parties information pertaining to the sale of a house
 listed in our database. This information will be posted on our web site and
 in the local Multiple Listing Service (MLS) for the purpose of marketing the
 home to the greatest number of potential buyers.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" size="2"> By requesting information or services from zipRealty.com, you give zipRealty.com permission to transfer your information, as necessary, to the appropriate parties, such as the title insurer, loan underwriter, appraiser, or inspector you select, so that they can fulfill your request and provide you with the services you require. All Online Agents are employees of zipRealty.com. All personally identifiable information you provide to zipRealty.com will be made available to your Online Agent. Generally, your Online Agent will coordinate the disclosure of your information to third parties. This will be done in much the same way as a traditional Real Estate Agent shares information with third parties. For example, your Online Agent may disclose your name and the address of the property you want to purchase to a building inspector when you request our assistance in arranging an inspection of the property. Your Online Agent will also share certain information with zipRealty.com Field Service Agents who will assist you in viewing properties.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica" size="2"> The various lending institutions, title companies and other service providers involved in your real estate transaction may each have their own privacy policies governing how they handle your personally identifiable information.

However, zipRealty.com accepts no responsibility or liability for third party privacy policies or the actions of any third party with respect to your personally identifiable information. </font></p>

 personally identifiable information in certain circumstances when we have reason
 to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to contact, identify
 or bring legal action against someone who may be intentionally or unintentionally

 anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. We may disclose personally
 identifiable information when we believe in good faith that the law requires
 it and for administrative or other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain
