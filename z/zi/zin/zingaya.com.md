We ensure that those companies are contractually bound to confidentiality and use the data received on our behalf in line with this Privacy Policy and guarantee an adequate level of data protection. We will remain liable for any failure by the third party that receives Personal Data on our behalf, unless we prove that the event giving rise to the damage was solely caused by the third party.

As discussed above, Zingaya’s Hosting Providers may physically have servers located anywhere in the world (i.e. including outside the European Union). In addition, Zingaya’s Service may be used to make and receive calls anywhere in the world. If you use our Services then information (including, without limitation, Personal Data) may be transferred to other countries outside of your country of residence, depending on the type of information and how it is stored by us. Such countries (including, without limitation, the United States) may not necessarily have data protection laws as comprehensive or protective as those in your country of residence; however, our collection, storage and use of your Personal Data will at all times continue to be governed by this Privacy Policy.

How Do We Protect Your Data, Information, and Resources?

We use secure technology to protect any information you provide us. The collected passive information is stored in secure databases. 

Your Choices – Access, Correction & Deletion

We respect your privacy rights and provide you with reasonable access to the Personal Data that you may have provided through your use of the Services. If you wish to access or amend any other Personal Data we hold about you, or to request that we delete or transfer any information about you that we have obtained from an Integrated Service, you may contact us as set forth in the “Contact Us” section. At your request, we will have any reference to you deleted or blocked in our database.

You may update, correct, or delete your account information and preferences at any time by accessing your Profile page within our site. Please note that while any changes you make will be reflected in active user databases instantly or within a reasonable period of time, we may retain all information you submit for backups, archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, satisfaction of legal obligations, or where we otherwise reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so.

You may decline to share certain Personal Data with us, in which case we may not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionality of the Service.

At any time, you may object to the processing of your Personal Data, on legitimate grounds, except if otherwise permitted by applicable law. If you believe your right to privacy granted by applicable data protection laws has been infringed upon, please contact Zingaya’s Data Protection Officer at [privacy@zingaya.com](mailto:privacy@zingaya.com). You also have a right to lodge a complaint with data protection authorities.

This provision does not apply to Personal Data that is part of Client Data. In this case, the management of the Client Data is subject to the Client’s own Privacy Policy, and any request for access, correction or deletion should be made to the Client responsible for the uploading and storage of such data into the Service.

## Data Retention

We only retain the Personal Data collected from you for as long as your account is active or otherwise for a limited period of time as long as we need it to fulfill the purposes for which we have initially collected it, unless otherwise required by law. We will retain and use information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements as follows:

• the contents of closed accounts are deleted within twelve (12) months of the date of closure;

• backups are kept for twelve (12) months;

• billing information is retained for a period of seven (7) years as of their provision to Zingaya in accordance with applicable accounting and taxation laws;

• information on legal transactions between Client and Zingaya is retained for a period of seven (7) years as of their provision to Zingaya in accordance with the general limitation period set for civil claims in applicable law.

## Data Controller and Data Processor

Zingaya does not own, control or direct the use of any of the Client Data stored or processed by a Client, User or End User within the Service. Only the Client or Users are entitled to access, retrieve and direct the use of such Client Data. Zingaya is largely unaware of what Client Data is actually being stored or made available by a Client or End User to or through the Service and does not directly access such Client Data except as authorized by the Client, or as necessary to provide Services to the Client, Users and End Users.

Because Zingaya does not collect or determine the use of any Personal Data contained in the Client Data and because it does not determine the purposes for which such Personal Data is collected, the means of collecting such Personal Data, or the uses of such Personal Data, Zingaya is not acting in the capacity of data controller in terms of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679, hereinafter “GDPR”), and does not have the associated responsibilities under the GDPR, with respect to Personal Data contained in any Client Data. Zingaya should be considered only as a processor on behalf of its Clients, Users and End Users as to any Client Data containing Personal Data that is subject to the requirements of the GDPR. Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, Zingaya does not independently cause Client Data containing Personal Data stored in connection with the Services to be transferred or otherwise made available to third parties, except to third-party subcontractors who may process such data on behalf of Zingaya in connection with Zingaya’s provision of Services to Clients, User and End Users. Such actions are performed or authorized only by the applicable Client or End User.

The Client or End User is the data controller under the Regulation for any Client Data containing Personal Data, meaning that such party controls the manner such Personal Data is collected and used as well as the determination of the purposes and means of the processing of Personal Data contained within any Personal Data.

Zingaya is not responsible for the content of the Personal Data contained in the Client Data or other information stored on its servers (or its subcontractors’ servers) at the discretion of the Client, Users or End Users, nor is Zingaya responsible for the manner in which the Client, Users or End Users collect, handle disclosure, distribute or otherwise process such information.

## Dispute Resolution

If you believe your Personal Data has been used in a way that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, we invite you to contact us first at [privacy@zingaya.com](mailto:privacy@zingaya.com). We will make all efforts to resolve your complaints timely and accurately. Further, we have committed to cooperate with EU Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC), and to comply with the information and advice provided by such authorities with regard to data transferred from the EU and Switzerland.

Under certain conditions, EU individuals may seek redress from the Privacy Shield Panel, a binding arbitration mechanism. 

## Modification of Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to modify the provisions of this Privacy Policy if deemed necessary. We will inform you of these changes on our website.
