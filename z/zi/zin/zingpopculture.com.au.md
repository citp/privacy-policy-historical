### How does Zing Pop Culture Protect Your Information?

Zing Pop Culture takes appropriate steps to protect your personal information. However, we acknowledge that the Internet is not a secure environment, and any information you send to us via that method is sent at your own risk. We maintain appropriate safeguards and current security standards to protect your personal information, whether recorded on paper or captured electronically, against unauthorised access, disclosure, or misuse. For example, electronic records are stored in secure, limited-access servers; electronic data is stored behind secured encryption access; we use technological tools like firewalls and strong passwords; and we ensure our employees are trained on the importance of maintaining the security and confidentiality of personal information. Although we cannot take responsibility for any theft, misuse, unauthorised disclosure, loss, alteration or destruction of data by a third party, we take reasonable security measures to safeguard against the loss, destruction, use, modification or disclosure of, or unauthorised access to, any personal information you have given us. Zing Pop Culture also has taken precautions to prevent the fraudulent use of your information on our Websites.

Our third party credit card processor also may take actions to determine the validity of your credit card.
