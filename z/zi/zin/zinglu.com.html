      <p align="left"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" size="4"><b>Information 
        we collect and how we use it</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">We may 
        collect any of the following types of information:</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"> Information 
        you provide – When you sign up for a Zinglu Account, we ask you for 
        personal information. We may combine the information you submit under 
        your account with information from other Zinglu services or third parties 
        in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality 
        of our services. For certain services, we may give you the opportunity 
        to opt out of combining such information. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">Cookies 
        – When you visit Zinglu, we send one or more cookies to your computer 
        or other device. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service, 
        including for storing user preferences, improving search results and ad 
        selection, and tracking user trends, such as how people search. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">Log information 
        – When you access Zinglu services via a browser, application or other 
        client our servers automatically record certain information. These server 
        logs may include information such as your web request, your interaction 
        with a service, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, 
        the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely 
        identify your browser or your account.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">User communications 
        – When you send email or other communications to Zinglu, we may retain 
        those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your 
        requests and improve our services. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">Affiliated 
        Zinglu Services on other sites – We offer some of our services on 
        or through other web sites. Personal information that you provide to those 
        sites may be sent to Zinglu in order to deliver the service. We process 
        such information under this Privacy Policy.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">Third Party 
        Applications – Zinglu may make available third party applications, 
        such as gadgets or extensions, through its services. The information collected 
        by Zinglu when you enable a third party application is processed under 
        this Privacy Policy. Information collected by the third party application 
        provider is governed by their privacy policies.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">Other sites 
        – This Privacy Policy applies to Zinglu services only. We do not 
        exercise control over the sites displayed as search results, sites that 
        include Zinglu applications, products or services, or links from within 
        our various services. These other sites may place their own cookies or 
        other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information 
        from you.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">In addition 
        to the above, we may use the information we collect to:</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"> Provide, 
        maintain, protect, and improve our services (including advertising services) 
        and develop new services; and<br>
        Protect the rights or property of Zinglu or our users.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">If we use 
        this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was 
        collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">Zinglu 
        processes personal information on our servers in the United States of 
        America . </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">Zinglu 
        only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside 
        of Zinglu in the following limited circumstances:</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"> We have 
        your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive 
        personal information.<br>
        We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies 
        or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal 
        information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process 
        such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this 
        Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security 
        measures.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><br>
        We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure 
        of such information is reasonably necessary to (1) satisfy any applicable 
        law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (2) 
        enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential 
        violations thereof, (3) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security 
        or technical issues, or (4) protect against harm to the rights, property 
        or safety of Zinglu, its users or the public as required or permitted 
        by law.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">If Zinglu 
        becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some 
        or all of its assets, we will ensure the confidentiality of any personal 
        information involved in such transactions and provide notice before personal 
        information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy 
        policy.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><br>
        <b><font size="3">Information security</font></b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">We take 
        appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to 
        or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include 
        internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices 
        and security measures, including appropriate encryption and physical security 
        measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store 
        personal data.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">We restrict 
        access to personal information to Zinglu employees, contractors and agents 
        who need to know that information in order to process it on our behalf. 
        These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be 
        subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, 
        if they fail to meet these obligations.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><br>
        <b><font size="4">Accessing and updating personal information</font></b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">When you 
        use Zinglu services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access 
        to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is 
        inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise 
        required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We 
        ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested 
        to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, 
        and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive 
        or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the 
        privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests 
        concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access 
        is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access 
        and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing 
        so would require a disproportionate effort. Because of the way we maintain 
        certain services, after you delete your information, residual copies may 
        take a period of time before they are deleted from our active servers 
        and may remain in our backup systems. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><br>
        <b><font size="4">Enforcement</font></b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">Zinglu 
        adheres to the US Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of Notice, Choice, Onward 
        Transfer, Security, Data Integrity, Access. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">Zinglu 
        regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. When we receive 
        formal written complaints, it is Zinglu’s policy to contact the complaining 
        user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate 
        regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to 
        resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot 
        be resolved between Zinglu and an individual.</font></p>

        <b><font size="4">Changes to this Privacy Policy</font></b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">Please 
        note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not 
        reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. 
        We will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes 
        are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for 
        certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes). We will 
        also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your 
        review. </font></p>
