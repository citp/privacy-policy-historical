throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to their use or

the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. We
encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal
information to others.</p>

alteration of the information under our control. These security
measures include a firewall to prevent unauthorized access to our
systems and maintenance of registration information in a separate
database. Although we will exercise reasonable care in providing secure
transmission of information between your computer and our servers, we
cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted to
us over the Internet and we accept no liability for any unintentional
disclosure. We will protect the transmission of credit card information
through industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption.</p>
<h3>IP recognition</h3>
<p>An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a unique string of numbers that
is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. Web

privacy policies that differ from ours. This privacy policy only covers
our Site and does not cover any other site. While we make every effort
to keep your information secure, we do not control the policies of
other sites.</p>

letters and special characters, and do not disclose your Zibbet
password to anyone. If you do share your password or your personal
information with others, remember that you are responsible for all
actions taken in the name of your account. If you lose control of your
password, you may lose substantial control over your personal
information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your
behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any
reason, you should immediately notify Zibbet and change your password.</p>
