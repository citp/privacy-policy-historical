| Privacy Statement  
---  
  
### Privacy Policy

LandlordPortal respects and protects the privacy of the individuals that use LandlordPortal's website and services ("LandlordPortal Site Services"). Individually identifiable information about you is not willfully disclosed to any third party without first receiving your permission, as explained in this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy"). 

### LandlordPortal and Cookies 

Upon your first visit to LandlordPortal, LandlordPortal sends a "cookie" to your computer. A cookie is a piece of data that identifies you as a unique user. LandlordPortal uses cookies to improve the quality of our service and to understand our user base more. LandlordPortal does this by storing user preferences in cookies and by tracking user trends and patterns of how people search. LandlordPortal will not disclose its cookies to third parties except as required by a valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order.

Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Be aware, however, that some parts of the LandlordPortal Website Service may not function properly if you refuse cookies. 

### What Information Do We Collect? 

LandlordPortal does not collect any unique information about you (such as your name, email address, etc.) except when you specifically and knowingly provide such information. LandlordPortal notes and saves information such as time of day, browser type, browser language, and IP address with each query. That information is used to verify our records and to provide more relevant services to users. For example, LandlordPortal may use your IP address or browser language to determine which language to use when showing search results or advertisements.

### Links to Other Sites 

The sites displayed as search results or linked to by LandlordPortal Site Services are developed by people over whom LandlordPortal exercises no control. Other links, such as those for the LandlordPortal-friends mailing list archive, are also on sites not controlled by LandlordPortal. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. LandlordPortal may choose to exhibit its search results in the form of a "URL redirecter." When LandlordPortal uses a URL redirecter, if you click on a URL from a search result, information about the click is sent to LandlordPortal, and LandlordPortal in turn sends you to the site you clicked on. LandlordPortal uses this URL information to understand and improve the quality of LandlordPortal's search technology. For instance, LandlordPortal uses this information to determine how often users are satisfied with the first result of a query and how often they proceed to later results. 

### With Whom Does LandlordPortal Share Information? 

LandlordPortal may share information about you with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties. However, we only divulge aggregate information about our users and will not share personally identifiable information with any third party without your express consent. For example, we may disclose how frequently the average LandlordPortal user visits LandlordPortal, or which other query words are most often used with the query word "Linux." Please be aware, however, that we will release specific personal information about you if required to do so in order to comply with any valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order. 

### Your consent and changes to the Privacy Policy 

By using the LandlordPortal Site Services and our web site, you consent to the collection and use of your information as we have outlined in this policy and to our Terms of Service Policy.
