            <p class="blueTxt">We respect your Privacy and protect the confidentiality of your Personal Information.</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy of 407 ETR (“our”, “we” and “us”) has been established in accordance with applicable legislation and to inform our customers, service providers and other individuals (“you” and “your”) about our practices and procedures concerning the collection, use, disclosure and retention of Personal Information.</p>
            <a name="Imp" id="Imp"></a><p><span class="subTitle"><b>IMPORTANT POLICY HIGHLIGHTS</b><b></b></span><b><br>
              <br>
            </b><span class="blueTxt">Keeping You Aware of and Informed about the Collection, Use and Disclosure of Your Personal Information</span></p>
            <p>Applicable Canadian privacy legislation defines “Personal Information” as any recorded information about an identifiable individual or information that allows an individual to be identified.  For the purposes of this Policy, Personal Information means recorded information about an identifiable individual other than information which is exempt under applicable legislation.</p>
            <p>Highway 407 ETR is a state-of-the-art, <u>open access</u> electronic toll highway legislated to provide service under the Highway 407 Act (the “407 Act”).  Under the 407 Act, we are authorized to collect, use and disclose your personal information for stipulated purposes as described in this Policy if you lease a transponder, or if a vehicle with licence plates registered in your name (the “Registered Holder”) travels Highway 407 ETR without the use of a transponder.</p>
			<p>We may obtain your Personal Information from you, from the Ministry of Transportation, Ontario and similar entities for other jurisdictions (collectively, “MTO”) and, in certain cases, from a collection agency in order to bill you for use of Highway 407 ETR, to collect payment from you, as further described below.  This Personal Information includes:
			</p><ul>
				<li>Name</li>
				<li>Mailing address</li>
				<li>Telephone number</li>
				<li>Vehicle licence plate</li>
				<li>Driver’s licence</li>
				<li>Transaction history</li>
			</ul>
			<p></p>
			<p>When you lease a transponder, or when a vehicle travels Highway 407 ETR without the use of a transponder, a 407 ETR account is established upon the lease of a transponder or the first use of Highway 407 ETR, as the case may be, unless in the case of the lease of the transponder, you have registered for an <a href="../Products/transponders_anonym.htm">Anonymous Account</a>.  Except in the case of an Anonymous Account, a 407 ETR account is always established in the name and address of the transponder lessee or Registered Holder, as the case may be, regardless of who drives the vehicle at the time of the recorded trip(s).  In the case of the Registered Holder, we then collect Personal Information of that person from the MTO for billing and collection purposes. 407 ETR’s transponders are proprietary encrypted to further protect customers’ privacy and to prevent unauthorized use of the technology.</p>
			<p>If you, as a transponder lessee or a Registered Holder, as the case may be, wish someone other than yourself to have access to all information on your account (such as a spouse or relative that manages your bills), please contact us to arrange this.</p>

			<p>If you or someone on your behalf provides us and/or any of our agents with Personal Information of another individual, you represent to us at the time that such Personal Information is provided, that you have all necessary authority and/or have obtained all necessary consent from such person to enable us to collect, use, disclose and retain such Personal Information in accordance with and for the purposes set forth in this Policy.</p>
			
			<p>We cannot and do not sell or otherwise disclose your Personal Information to any other company or organization to promote the products or services of that company or organization. We only disclose your Personal Information when authorized by the Act, for example, to limited third parties (such as a collection agency) in order to administer or collect payments on our behalf.</p>

			<p>Just as 407 ETR is unique from any other highway in Canada, we are also different from many businesses you choose to deal with like your financial institution, insurance company, public utility or a credit card company. That&rsquo;s because with those companies, you need to call or sign-up with them and provide your pertinent personal information before you are provided any product or service.</p>
            <p>As a state-of-the-art, open access electronic toll highway legislated to provide service under the Highway 407 Act, when you choose to travel 407 ETR, you consent to the retrieval of your personal information as the registered owner of the vehicle plate, by use of the highway. This information is supplied to us from the Ministry of Transportation (MTO) to bill you for choosing to use 407 ETR and collect payment. In fact, we are required &ndash; by law &ndash; to use your personal information for this purpose. </p>
            <p>407 ETR cannot and does not sell your personal information to any other company or organization to promote their products or services. We only disclose your personal information, should it be necessary, to limited third parties (such as a collection agency) who must also abide with this agreement, so as to administer or collect payments on behalf of 407 ETR.</p>
            <p>It&rsquo;s important to note that account set up at 407 ETR revolves around a vehicle plate entering and exiting the highway, unless you have <a href="../Products/transponders.htm">registered for a transponder</a> or <a href="..\Products\transponders_anonym.htm">anonymous account</a>. Once a trip has been recorded with your vehicle plate, we then collect your personal information from the Ministry of Transportation and establish an account for you. A 407 ETR bill account is always set up in the name and address of the vehicle plate owner, regardless of who drives the vehicle at the time of the recorded trip(s).</p>
            <p>Similarly, if you wish for someone other than yourself (vehicle plate owner) to have access to all information on your account (such as a spouse or relative that manages your bills), please contact us to have this person(s) added to your account record as an alternate account holder.</p>
            <p>You can have your personal information deleted from our records &ndash; if evidence demonstrates that a vehicle plate registered in your name has not travelled 407 ETR &ndash; by contacting us in writing and include your name, address and 407 ETR account number.</p>
