This notice describes our privacy policy. By visiting us, you are accepting the privacy policy described <br soft="">below.<br><br>1. &nbsp;What Personal Information Do We Collect?<br><br>Information You Provide. &nbsp;We receive and store information you enter. &nbsp;For example, when you search for or buy a <br soft="">product or service, or when you supply information such as your address, phone number or credit card. You can <br soft="">choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of some of our <br soft="">features. &nbsp;We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing <br soft="">future shopping for you, improving our website, and communicating with you. &nbsp;In addition, if you choose, we may <br soft="">share your information with other companies who provide goods or services that you are interested in. &nbsp;Please see <br soft="">the “opt-in/opt-out” selection in Section 4 of this policy.<br>Cookies. Like many websites, we use "cookies". &nbsp;Cookies are small programs that we transfer to your hard drive <br soft="">that allow us to recognize you and to provide you with a customized shopping experience. &nbsp;If you do not want us to <br soft="">use cookies, you can easily disable them by going to the toolbar of your web browser, and clicking on the “help” <br soft="">button. &nbsp;Follow the instructions that will prevent the browser from accepting cookies, or set the browser to inform <br soft="">you when you receive a new cookie. &nbsp;In addition, you may visit this and other websites anonymously through the <br soft="">use of utilities provided by other private companies.<br>Other Information: Every computer has an IP (Internet Protocol) address. &nbsp;IP addresses of computers used to visit <br soft="">this site are noted. &nbsp;In addition, we automatically collect other information such as email addresses, browser types, <br soft="">operating systems, and the URL addresses of sites clicked to and from this site.<br>Information from Other Sources. &nbsp;We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our <br soft="">account information. &nbsp;This may include updated delivery and address information from our shippers or other <br soft="">sources so that we can correct our records and deliver your next purchase or communication more easily. &nbsp;<br>2. &nbsp;How Do We Use Your Information?<br><br>Customized Shopping. &nbsp;We use your information to better serve you by providing a customized shopping <br soft="">experience. &nbsp;As noted above, you may “opt-out” of this customization, or even visit and shop anonymously.<br>Agents. We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include <br soft="">delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, and processing credit card payments. They have access to <br soft="">personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.<br>Special Offers. &nbsp;We may send you special offers from time to time, unless you choose to “opt-out” of receiving such <br soft="">offers. &nbsp;In addition, we may also send you special offers from other companies. &nbsp;Again, you may “opt-out”. &nbsp;If we <br soft="">send you offers from other businesses, we do not share your personal information with them. &nbsp;The offers come <br soft="">directly through us. &nbsp;Please see the “opt-in/opt-out” selection at the end of this policy. &nbsp;<br>Business Transfers. As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores or assets. In such <br soft="">transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely event <br soft="">that we are acquired, customer information will be one of the transferred assets.<br>Law Enforcement. &nbsp;&nbsp;If we receive a lawful court order to release account or other personal information then we will <br soft="">comply with the law. &nbsp;We will also release information when necessary to protect the life, safety or property of <br soft="">others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and <br soft="">credit risk reduction.<br><br><br>3. &nbsp;How Do We Protect the Security of Your Information?<br><br>We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) <br soft="">software, which encrypts information you input.<br>We use encryption to protect your information contained in our customer list.<br>We use a firewall to protect against unlawful intrusion.<br>We limit access to your information on a “need to know” basis.<br>We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the <br soft="">entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.<br>It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to <br soft="">sign off when finished using a shared computer.<br>No system can guarantee absolute security, just as the finest lock can not guarantee physical security. &nbsp;However, <br soft="">we take every reasonable precaution to assure that your data is secure.<br>4. &nbsp;Your Choice: &nbsp;Opt-in or Opt-out.<br><br>It is your choice whether to receive emails or special offers from us or others. &nbsp;The following section provides you <br soft="">with this choice. &nbsp;Please note the default settings.<br><br>· &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please send me email or other mail informing me of special offers of your products or services.<br><br>· &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please do not send me email or other mail informing me of special offers of your products or services.<br><br>· &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please send me email or other mail informing me of special offers of related products or services from other <br soft="">companies.<br><br>· &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please do not send me email or other mail informing me of special offers of related products or services from <br soft="">other companies.<br><br>5. &nbsp;Children<br><br><br>We do not sell products or services to children. If you are under 18, you may use this site only with involvement of <br soft="">a parent or guardian.<br><br><br><br>6. &nbsp;Other Websites<br><br>Various Web sites may be linked to from this site. &nbsp;If you link to another site, your privacy depends on the policy of <br soft="">that site. &nbsp;We strongly urge you to check their privacy policy. &nbsp;Not all sites guarantee that they will not share your <br soft="">personally identifiable information with others. &nbsp;You may also wish to consult privacy guidelines such as those <br soft="">recommended by the Online Privacy Alliance (www.privacyalliance.org).<br><br><br>7. &nbsp;Contact Us<br><br><br>If you would like to learn more about our privacy policy, or to access your personally identifiable information <br soft="">contained on our website, you may contact us at ________. &nbsp;You will be required to provide identifier information to <br soft="">assure that this information is not released to others. &nbsp;We reserve the right to modify this policy in the future. &nbsp;If we <br soft="">do so, notice will be posted on our home page.<br><br>*********************************<br><br>NOTES<br><br><br><br>Section 1. &nbsp;&nbsp;Different sites will collect different information. &nbsp;For example, if you do not collect credit card <br soft="">information, do not include this. &nbsp;YOUR site must be customized for the data that you collect. &nbsp;Same with cookies. &nbsp;If <br soft="">you do not use them, simply state that. &nbsp;<br><br><br><br>Section 2. &nbsp;It is highly recommended that you not sell your customer lists or other personally identifiable information <br soft="">to others, e.g. marketing firms or other companies. &nbsp;It is far better to rent out a one time use of selected customers, <br soft="">where YOU send out the email offers of another company. &nbsp;That way the information never leaves your premises <br soft="">and is always under your control. &nbsp;If however you plan to sell or rent the p.i. information of your customers, you <br soft="">should inform them of this possibility and give them an opportunity to opt-out of that action.<br><br><br><br>Section 3. &nbsp;You must provide the security you promise. &nbsp;Different levels of security are appropriate for different <br soft="">types of businesses. &nbsp;You should certainly have a firewall and limited access protection, at a minimum. &nbsp;Encryption <br soft="">of the customer list is highly recommended, and is getting easier.<br><br><br><br>Section 4. &nbsp;The opt-in/opt-out section is very important. &nbsp;The bullets represent clickable choices, that is, circles that <br soft="">can be dotted. &nbsp;You will want to set the default settings on the choices #1 and #3, that allow you to send special <br soft="">offers from your own site and also from related companies.<br><br><br><br>Section 5. &nbsp;There are special laws protecting the privacy of children, including the federal Childrens’ Online Privacy <br soft="">Protection Act (COPPA). &nbsp;It is safest not to sell to or collect information from children. &nbsp;If your site is specifically <br soft="">directed at children, then you should seek specific legal advice on how to comply with these laws.<br><br><br><br>Section 6. &nbsp;Privacy guidelines require that visitors be able to access their information.<br><br><br><br>MOST IMPORTANT: &nbsp;DO NOT MAKE YOUR PRIVACY POLICY STRONGER THAN NECESSARY, AND BE SURE <br soft="">TO FOLLOW IT. &nbsp;TAILOR THE POLICY TO YOUR SITE. &nbsp;SEEK THE ADVISE OF LEGAL COUNSEL THAT IS <br soft="">EXPERIENCED IN E-COMMERCE ISSUES. &nbsp;REMEMBER: &nbsp;IT IS FAR BETTER TO HAVE NO PRIVACY POLICY <br soft="">THAN ONE WHICH IS VIOLATED.<br soft=""></span></span>      </div>
