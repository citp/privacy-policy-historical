              <p>Privacy Policy&nbsp;<br>
                &nbsp; 
                Welcome to <a href="risk-warning.php">4XCashback</a> (the “Site”).<br>
                We   understand that privacy online is important to users of our Site, especially   when conducting business.</p>
              <p>This statement governs our privacy policies with respect to those users of   the Site (”Visitors”) who visit without transacting business and Visitors who   register to transact business on the Site and make use of the various services   offered by www. fxrebates.com (collectively, “Services”) (”Authorized   Customers”).<br>
                “Personally Identifiable Information”<br>
                refers to any   information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact, or locate the   person to whom such information pertains, including, but not limited to, name,   address, phone number, fax number, email address, financial profiles, social   security number, and credit card information. Personally Identifiable   Information does not include information that is collected anonymously (that is,   without identification of the individual user)<br>
                or demographic information not   connected to an identified individual.</p>
              <p>What Personally Identifiable Information is collected?<br>
                We may collect   basic user profile information from all of our Visitors. We collect the   following additional information from our Authorized Customers: the names,   addresses, phone numbers and email addresses of Authorized Customers, the nature   and size of the business, and the nature and size of the advertising inventory   that the Authorized Customer intends to purchase or sell.</p>
              <p>What organizations are collecting the information?<br>
                In addition to our   direct collection of information, our third party service vendors (such as   credit card companies, clearinghouses and banks) who may provide such services   as credit, insurance, and escrow services may collect this information from our   Visitors and Authorized Customers. We do not control how these third parties use   such information, but we do ask them to disclose how they use personal   information provided to them from Visitors and Authorized Customers. Some of   these third parties may be intermediaries that act solely as links in the   distribution chain, and do not store, retain, or use the information given to   them.</p>
              <p>How does the Site use Personally Identifiable Information?<br>
                We use   Personally Identifiable Information to customize the Site, to make appropriate   service offerings, and to fulfill buying and selling requests on the Site. We   may email Visitors and Authorized Customers about research or purchase and   selling opportunities on the Site or information related to the subject matter   of the Site. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to contact   Visitors and Authorized Customers in response to specific inquiries, or to   provide requested information.</p>
              <p>With whom may the information may be shared?<br>
                Personally Identifiable   Information about Authorized Customers may be shared with other Authorized   Customers who wish to evaluate potential transactions with other Authorized   Customers. We may share aggregated information about our Visitors, including the   demographics of our Visitors and Authorized Customers, with our affiliated   agencies and third party vendors. We also offer the opportunity to “opt out” of   receiving information or being contacted by us or by any agency acting on our   behalf.</p>
              <p>How is Personally Identifiable Information stored?<br>
                Personally Identifiable   Information collected by www. fxrebates.com is securely stored and is not   accessible to third parties or employees of www. fxrebates.com except for use as   indicated above.<br>
                What choices are available to Visitors regarding collection,   use and distribution of the information?<br>
                Visitors and Authorized Customers   may opt out of receiving unsolicited information from or being contacted by us   and/or our vendors and affiliated agencies by responding to emails as   instructed.</p>
              <p>Are Cookies Used on the Site?<br>
                Cookies are used for a variety of reasons.   We use Cookies to obtain information about the preferences of our Visitors and   the services they select. We also use Cookies for security purposes to protect   our Authorized Customers. For example, if an Authorized Customer is logged on   and the site is unused for more than 10 minutes, we will automatically log the   Authorized Customer off.</p>
              <p>What partners or service providers have access to Personally Identifiable   Information from Visitors and/or Authorized Customers on the Site?<br>
                  <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.fxrebates.com/');" href="http://www.4xcashback.com/" rel="nofollow">4XCashback</a> has entered   into and will continue to enter into partnerships and other affiliations with a   number of vendors.<br>
                Such vendors may have access to certain Personally   Identifiable Information on a need to know basis for evaluating Authorized   Customers for service eligibility.<br>
                Our privacy policy does not cover their   collection or use of this information.<br>
                Disclosure of Personally Identifiable   Information to comply with law. We will disclose Personally Identifiable   Information in order to comply with a court order or subpoena or a request from   a law enforcement agency to release information. We will also disclose   Personally Identifiable Information when reasonably necessary to protect the   safety of our Visitors and Authorized Customers.</p>
              <p>How does the Site keep Personally Identifiable Information secure?<br>
                All of   our employees are familiar with our security policy and practices. The   Personally Identifiable Information of our Visitors and Authorized Customers is   only accessible to a limited number of qualified employees who are given a   password in order to gain access to the information. We audit our security   systems and processes on a regular basis. Sensitive information, such as credit   card numbers or social security numbers, is protected by encryption protocols,   in place to protect information sent over the Internet. While we take   commercially reasonable measures to maintain a secure site, electronic   communications and databases are subject to errors, tampering and break-ins, and   we cannot guarantee or warrant that such events will not take place and we will   not be liable to Visitors or Authorized Customers for any such occurrences.</p>
              <p>How can Visitors correct any inaccuracies in Personally Identifiable   Information?<br>
                Visitors and Authorized Customers may contact us to update   Personally Identifiable Information about them or to correct any inaccuracies by   emailing us at <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/mailto/info@fxrebates.com');" href="mailto:info@4xcashback.com" rel="nofollow">infoat4xcashback.com</a> This e-mail   address is being protected from spam bots, you need JavaScript enabled to view   it</p>
              <p>Can a Visitor delete or deactivate Personally Identifiable Information   collected by the Site?<br>
                We provide Visitors and Authorized Customers with a   mechanism to delete/deactivate Personally Identifiable Information from the   Site’s database by contacting <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/mailto/info@fxrebates.com');" href="mailto:info@4xcashback.com" rel="nofollow">infoat4xcashback.com</a><a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/mailto/info@fxrebates.com');" href="mailto:info@fxrebates.com" rel="nofollow"></a> This e-mail   address is being protected from spam bots, you need JavaScript enabled to view   it . However, because of backups and records of deletions, it may be impossible   to delete a Visitor’s entry without retaining some residual information. An   individual who requests to have Personally Identifiable Information deactivated   will have this information functionally deleted, and we will not sell, transfer,   or use Personally Identifiable Information relating to that individual in any   way moving forward.</p>
              <p>What happens if the Privacy Policy Changes?<br>
                We will let our Visitors and   Authorized Customers know about changes to our privacy policy by posting such   changes on the Site. However, if we are changing our privacy policy in a manner   that might cause disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information that a   Visitor or Authorized Customer has previously requested not be disclosed, we   will contact such Visitor or Authorized Customer to allow such Visitor or   Authorized Customer to prevent such disclosure.</p>
