### Sharing of Information with third-parties:

### Merchandizing Partners:

Rebate Center works with Merchandizing Partners to offer consumers rebate choices such as selected merchandise or services instead of the customary cash rebate. For those customers who elect to redeem their rebate by selecting the merchandise or services offered by our Merchandizing Partners, we provide the Merchandizing Partners with the customer's information necessary for them to fulfill the customer's selection. Such information will include the name, address, phone, and email address of the customer. Use of customers' information by Merchandizing Partners is governed by the privacy policy of the company offering the particular merchandize or product.

We may employ other companies or individuals to provide certain services to us such as analyzing customer lists and data, providing marketing assistance, or consulting services. These third parties will have access to the information needed to perform their functions but cannot use that information for any other purpose. Any 3rd parties who use our data will be fully bound by this privacy policy. In no event will the data being used by any unrelated third party include your email address.

This information does not allow 3rd parties, vendors and affiliated business partners to identify you individually in any way.
