PERSONAL INFORMATION 

We collect personal information when we provide our services to you. Generally we will tell you why we are collecting information when we collect it and how we plan to use it or these things will be obvious when we collect the information. We usually collect personal information directly from you although sometimes we may use agents or service providers to do this for us. We may also acquire lists from other sources, both from other companies and from other public documents.

We usually collect personal information such as your name, address, telephone number. When you are online, we collect information regarding the pages within our network which you visit and what you click on. As a general rule we do not collect sensitive information.

Any information that we collect in relation to your credit or debit card details is not kept by us after we use it. We do pass this information on to our financial institution and to our bill payment systems provider to deal with your credit or debt card in order to process your information for the purposes of payment to us for your advertising.

USE OF AGGRAGATE DATA 

We may collect certain non-personal information to optimise our goods and services including our Web pages for your computer (e.g., the identity of your Internet browser, the type of operating system you use, your IP address and the domain name of your Internet service provider). We may use such non-personal information for internal purposes, including but not limited to improving the content of our sites. Outdoor Supacentre may use personally identifiable information in aggregate form to improve our goods and services including our Web sites and make them more responsive to the needs of our customers.

We use a variety of physical and electronic security measures including restricting physical access to our offices and firewalls and secure databases to keep personal information secure from misuse, loss or unauthorised use or disclosure. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure. 

ACCESS TO PERSONAL INFORMATION

POSSIBLE DISCLOSURE TO OVERSEAS RECIPENTS

Outdoor Supacentre uses several services that are located overseas, principally in the USA, all of which have Privacy Policies that have obligations to protect information in a substantially similar way as Australia and they have mechanisms that you can access to take action to enforce protection. Outdoor Supacentre uses Google Data analytics which does not collect your personal information.

UNSOLICITED PERSONAL INFORMATION

If Outdoor Supacentre receives information which we did not ask for we will determine whether we could have collected this information lawfully. If we determine that it could not then we will destroy it and de-identify it where it is lawful to do so.

They allow us to track usage patterns and to compile data that can help us improve our content and target advertising.

But you should note that Cookies may be necessary to provide you with features such as merchandise transactions or registered services. 

ONLINE LINKS TO THIRD PARTY AND CO-BRANDED SITES 

Outdoor Supacentre may establish relationships with business partners that allow visitors to our Internet sites to link directly to sites operated by these partners. Some of these sites may be "co-branded" with our logo; however, these sites may not be operated or maintained by or on our behalf. These sites may collect personal information from you that may be shared with us. This Privacy Statement will apply to any personal information we obtain in this manner. Outdoor Supacentre is not responsible for the content or practices of Web sites operated by third parties that are linked to our sites. These links are meant for the user's convenience only. Links to third party sites do not constitute sponsorship, endorsement or approval by Outdoor Supacentre of the content, policies or practices of those third party sites. Once you have left our site via such a link, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party site. 

WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT INTERNET PRIVACY 

Remember to close your browser when you have finished your user session. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet café. You as an individual are responsible for the security of and access to your own computer. Whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information over the Internet, this information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information in publicly accessible online forums, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your username and passwords and any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are using the Internet.
