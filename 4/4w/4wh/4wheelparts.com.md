**Your Personal Information Is Private**  
4 Wheel Parts is serious about protecting our customers’ personal information. You can always browse our site without providing any personal information.

While doing business with you, we may have to gather certain information, such as your name, home address, vehicle and email address. We will not sell, rent, trade or give away individual, personally identifiable information entered on this site to any third party. We collect such information so that we can process orders, personalize your shopping experience, or send you the latest product and other useful material. If you do not wish to receive further material from 4 Wheel Parts, you can simply respond to our email or otherwise tell us that you do not want to receive future communications.

**Online Orders**  
4 Wheel Parts also collects credit card information from you to process purchases from the site. Verisign, a leader in online credit card transactions and security, is used for credit card processing. Whenever you transmit credit card information and other personal information through our site, the numbers and letters are scrambled using encryption technology, making it nearly impossible for the information to be stolen or intercepted. To protect your security, we do not allow you to store your credit card number from session to session.

**Cookies**  
4 Wheel Parts, like most Web sites, uses a feature of your browser to set a "cookie" on your computer. We cannot tell your name or any personal information about you based solely on the cookie. Unless you specifically tell us your name and other identifying information, we will never know who you are. All the cookie tells us is what functions you perform when you are on the site so that we can keep track of your transaction. A cookie also helps 4 Wheel Parts note particular traffic patterns on the site so that we can improve what we offer.

Every browser allows you to reject cookies or to choose which cookies you will accept. Rejecting cookies, however, may sometimes interfere with your ability to use all the features and benefits of our site.

**Third Parties**  
On occasion, we provide non-personal, aggregate information about our users to third parties such as manufacturers and business partners. For example, we may inform a tire manufacturer about what other products its users buy. This information will not identify any user personally.

**Outside Links**  
4 Wheel Parts may offer links to other sites. Any time you click on a link and are transported to another site, you should be aware that the other site may have a different privacy policy than 4 Wheel Parts. We cannot control the policies of other sites.

**Changes**  
This privacy policy is subject to change at the sole discretion of 4 Wheel Parts. When we modify it, we will post the changes in a revised policy statement.
