                This Privacy Policy (the “<strong>Policy</strong>”) sets out the personal information practices for 411.ca (“<strong>411.ca</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>” or “<strong>us</strong>”) and the use of the www.411.ca website (the “<strong>Site</strong>”). These practices seek to balance an individual’s right to the privacy of his or her personal information and the need for 411.ca to collect, use, disclose and otherwise manage the personal information provided through the use of the Site and personal information submitted to 411.ca in respect of various services offered by us. We may update this Policy from time to time and you are responsible for reviewing the most current version of this Policy. This Policy was last amended on the date shown at the end of the Policy.

                Personal information is any information that can be used to identify you as an individual, including your name, age, personal telephone number, location, photograph, email address, and any other personally identifiable information that you choose to provide to 411.ca. Personal information does not include so-called “business card information” such as your business telephone number and address in your capacity as an employee of an organization.            </p>
            <p>
                We do not knowingly collect information from those under the age of majority in their province of residence. If you are a minor, you must ensure that you have your parent or guardian’s consent before using the Site, including the creation of an account and transmitting content to or through the Site.             </p>

            <p>
                411.ca collects personal information from you by asking you to provide information such as your name and email address when you create an account. Your name will be used to create your account name (first name, last name). We will use the e-mail address that you provided when you registered your account to send you updates, correspond with you about updates and provide you with products and services that you requested in connection with the Site. You must update your 411.ca account on your “Info” page if your registration information changes.            </p>

                411.ca collects personal information about users when a user contributes to the Site, including by (i) writing a review; (ii) uploading photos; (iii) filling out a public profile; (iv) voting on other users’ contributions or (v) otherwise posting, sharing or uploading content through the Site. We may store these user contributions, display them to other users and use them for promotional purposes or as otherwise permitted in our <a href="/pages/terms">Terms of Use</a>. Any information in the user’s profile that the user chooses to make public (through privacy settings) can be used and viewed by others, including through Internet search engines. Contributions to the Site, including reviews, will always be made public.  411.ca also operates a web based online reporting tool (the “<strong>Radar Software</strong>”) that is used by business customers of 411.ca to collect information regarding online reviews submitted regarding their businesses. All of your reviews on the Site will be captured by the Radar Software and disclosed to the applicable business customers of 411.ca along with your name. If you do not wish your contributions to the Site to be made public, do not contribute content to the Site. We may from time to time also offer other features or services on the Site which permit you to submit content. They will be governed by these terms as well, unless other terms are provided at that time.            </p>

            <p>
                We may record the phone numbers of businesses that users call through the Site, so that we can aggregate usage data about those businesses. Note that your call will be recorded by our third party service provider to track advertising results.            </p>
