## Security

We are committed to protecting your personal information. Security measures are in place on this Web site to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. We offer industry-standard security measures available through your Web browser. When you are on this Web site, the sensitive information you provide such as credit card and financial information is encrypted with secure socket layer (SSL) technology and scrambled en route and decoded once it reaches us. No method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Please remember that e-mail, which is different from the encrypted sessions above, is not secure. Therefore, we ask that you do not send sensitive information such as credit card or account numbers to us via an unsecured e-mail message.

Information you provide will be safeguarded according to strict standards of security and confidentiality. We recognize and appreciate the importance of responsible use of the information you choose to provide. We take steps to require that our vendors, consultants, suppliers, and contractors observe our Privacy Policy with respect to security and the collection, use, and exchange of our customers' information. They are expected to abide by the Privacy Policy when conducting work for us and are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.

In order to make your visit to our website as productive as possible, we track certain user activity. However, we want you to know that the tracking technology we use does not identify any personal information about you. It cannot retrieve data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, or capture any personal information about you, such as your name, address, phone number, or email address. We only know who you are if you tell us.

As is true with most websites, we gather certain information automatically when individuals browse our site and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this non-personal information to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, in order to improve the functionality of the website. We use a third-party tracking service that uses technology to track this non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate.

We use cookies to improve your shopping experience. Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your web browser on your computer's hard drive. A cookie may contain information (such as a unique user session ID) that is used to track the pages of the websites you've visited.

Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages.
