            <h2>HOW WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION</h2>
            <p>Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our <a href="/terms-of-service">Terms of Use</a>.</p>
            <p>We collect the following types of information about you:</p>
            <p><strong>Information you provide us directly:</strong> When you register for a 42Floors account or correspond with us as a prospective tenant, we ask for certain information such as your first and last name, phone number, email address, and the name, size, search parameters, and prospective growth of your company. When you register for a 42Floors account or correspond with us as a broker or agent, we ask for your name, ID number, name of brokerage or agency, and job title. For any and all Users, we may retain any messages you send through the Service, and may collect information you provide in User Content you post to the Service. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service.</p>
            <p><strong>Information we may receive from third parties</strong>: We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you access our websites or Service through a third-party connection or log-in, for example, through Facebook Connect, by “following,” “liking,” adding the 42Floors application, linking your account to the 42Floors Service, etc., that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to 42Floors. This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account (for example, your Facebook UID), an access token necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service. If you allow us access to your friends list, your friends’ user IDs, and your connection to those friends, may be used and stored to make your experience more social, and to allow you to invite your friends to use our Service as well as provide you with updates if and when your friends join 42Floors. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the 42Floors Service. You may also unlink your third party account from the Service by adjusting your settings on the third party service. If you unlink your third party account, we will remove the information collected about you in connection with that service.</p>
            <p><strong>Inviting a friend to use 42Floors from the “Invite collaborators” feature:</strong> If you choose to use our invitation service to invite a third party to the Service through our “Invite collaborators” feature, you may directly choose a person to invite through your email client or mobile device’s native contact list – but we do not require that you import your contacts list to the Service, and we do not retain the information contained in your contacts list. You understand that by inviting a collaborator to 42Floors through the “Invite collaborators” feature, you are directly sending a text or email from your personal accounts and that we are not storing your contact list. In addition, you understand and agree that normal carrier charges apply to communications sent from you phone. Since this invitation is coming directly from your email or phone, we do not have access to or control this communication.</p>
            <p><strong>Analytics information</strong>: We may directly collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual user.</p>
            <p><strong>Cookies information</strong>: When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets 42Floors help you log in faster, return to a previous search, and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Service), and allow us or our business partners to track your usage of the Service over time. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.</p>
            <p><strong>Log file information</strong>: Log file information is automatically reported by your browser or mobile device each time you access the Service. When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.</p>
            <p><strong>Clear gifs/web beacons information</strong>: When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our Users. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information is allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</p>
            <p><strong>Device identifiers</strong>: When you access the Service by or through a mobile device (including but not limited to smart-phones or tablets), we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers,” such as a universally unique identifier (“UUID”). Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by 42Floors. A device identifier may convey information to us about how you browse and use the Service. A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.</p>
            <p><strong>Location data</strong>: When you access the Service by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store “location data,” which may include GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device. Location data may convey to us information about how you browse and use the Service. Some features of the Service, particularly location-based services, may not function properly if use or availability of location data is impaired or disabled.</p>
            <p><strong>Commercial and marketing communications: </strong> We use the information we collect or receive to communicate directly with you. We may send you emails containing newsletters, property listings, promotions and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you will be given the option to opt out or change your preferences. We also use your information to send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, purchase and billing confirmations and reminders, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). You may not opt out of Service-related e-mails. If you are a broker, or post any listing to the Service, you may also be able to be “found” on 42Floors based on information that you provide.</p>
            <p><strong>Use of certain service type information we collect about you: </strong> We use or may use cookies, log file, device identifiers, location data and clear gifs information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) to provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems; (f) help you efficiently access your information after you sign in; (g) to provide advertising to your browser or device, and (h) automatically update the 42Floors application on your mobile devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Storage and Processing</strong>: Your information collected through the Service may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which 42Floors or its subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities. 42Floors may transfer information that we collect about you, including personal information, to affiliated entities, or to other third parties across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or any other country in which 42Floors or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p><strong>Keeping your information safe</strong>: 42Floors cares about the security of your information, and uses commercially reasonable safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of all information collected through the Service. To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to your email communications from 42Floors, at all times. However, 42Floors cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to 42Floors or guarantee that information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed. Your privacy settings may also be affected by changes to the functionality of third party sites and services that you add to the 42Floors Service, such as social networks. 42Floors is not responsible for the functionality or security measures of any third party.</p>
            <p><strong>Compromise of information</strong>: In the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, 42Floors will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information may have been compromised and take other steps, in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.</p>
