**Information Collection and Use**

451 Research is committed to safeguarding the privacy of our users. This page describes 451 Research’s privacy policy. When you register on 451 Research’s Web sites, or for 451 Research events, or you purchase products, we ask you to provide personal information.

**Collection of Personally Identifiable Information**

Personally Identifiable Information is any piece of data about a person that can, in any way, identify them or allow someone to contact them.

Aggregated information is used for any number of purposes, including future research direction, press releases and customer relations. There are no limitations on the use of aggregated information as exist with personally identifiable and personally linked information.
