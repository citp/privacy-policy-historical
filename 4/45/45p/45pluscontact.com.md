### Cookies that collect behavioural data in order to provide suitable web content

Our goal is to provide visitors of our website with information that is as relevant as possible for them. That means that we try to customize our website as much as possible to fit the needs of every individual user. We do not only do this through the content on our website, but also through the ads that are displayed. 

In order for us to make these personal adjustments we try using the websites that you visit to develop an idea of your presumed interests, without building a profile or identifying you as a person. Based on this information we adapt the content and advertising on our website for different target groups. This means that according to your online behaviour you will fit in a certain category, such as 'men in the age group 20-30 years old, married and children with an interest in football.' This group will then, of course, get different advertisements than the another ad segment, for example 'woman, age group 20-30 years old, unmarried and with an interest in travel'.

Third parties who place cookies on our website can also discover your interests in a similar way. The information about your current website visit can be combined with information from previous visits to websites other than our own.

If such cookies are not used it does not mean that you will not get advertisements on our website anymore. The advertisements are only no longer tailored to your interests.

These cookies allow websites:

  1. to register your visits to make an assessment of your interests
  2. to determine whether you clicked an advertisement
  3. transmit information about your online behaviour to other websites
  4. to use third-party services to serve you with fitting ads
  5. display interesting ads based on your use of social media
