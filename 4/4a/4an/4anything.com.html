		  <b><br>
		  4ANYTHING.COM PRIVACY POLICY<br>
		  </b><br>
		  4anything.com, Inc. has developed this Privacy Policy for the benefit of the 
		  Users of its  4anything.com Network, to demonstrate its serious commitment 
		  to protecting privacy on the 4anything.com Network. Accordingly, the following 
		  information summarizes 4anything.com's personal data gathering and distribution 
		  practices for the 4anything.com Network as found at http://www.4anything.com.<br> 
		  <br>
		  As Internet technology changes, 4anything.com may change the content found on the 
		  4anything.com Network, and consequently, its Privacy Policy.  
		  Please revisit our Privacy Policy from time to time to be sure that you are 
		  familiar with our current policy. Your continued use of the 4anything.com 
		  Network following any modifications to this Privacy Policy will be viewed as 
		  representing your acceptance of such changes. Please see 4anything.com's

		  for more information on the terms and conditions governing 
		  the use of the 4anything.com Network.<br>
		  <br>

		  <b>Why does 4anything.com need my personal
		  information?<br>
		  <br>
		  </b>In order to provide our Users with a more personalized, 
		  relevant and intelligent service, 4anything.com regularly makes 
		  improvements to the 4anything.com Network. The collection of personal 
		  data greatly assists 4anything.com in this improvement process by 
		  identifying the specific interests and needs of the many Users of the 
		  4anything.com Network. Data collection also assists 4anything.com by 
		  allowing it to advertise its products and/or services or the products 
		  and/or services of others in a more efficient manner.<br>
		  <br>
		  Although 4anything.com's primary goal in collecting personal 
		  information is to deliver a customized and personalized service 
		  to Users, 4anything.com also uses the personal information it 
		  collects to send Users E-mail notifications of new features or 
		  information available through the 4anything.com Network, and other 
		  information that 4anything.com feels might be of interest to Users 
		  of the 4anything.com Network. 4anything.com also collects IP addresses, 
		  or the location of your computer on the Internet, for system administration 
		 and troubleshooting purposes, and to report aggregate information to our 
		 advertisers and others. 4anything.com also collects and transfers to its 
		 appropriate partners the personal data volunteered by Users who request 
		 information or quotes for various services offered through the 4anything.com 
		 Network in order for such partners to provide the requested information or quotes.  
		 Lastly, 4anything.com uses personal information for verification purposes 
		 for the provision of some of its services, such as E-mail.<br>
		  <br>
		  <b>How and what information does 4anything.com
		  gather or track?<br>
		  <br>
		  </b>Through the use of "cookies" (as described
		  below) and on-line data entry, survey and
		  registration forms, 4anything.com may collect
		  and/or monitor, in aggregate and individual form,
		  personal identifying facts or data on, among other
		  things, the following information:<br>

		  4anything.com gathers most of the personal information it 
		  collects on its Users during an initial registration process 
		  for certain services such as E-mail or newsletters. Although some 
		  of the personal identifying information is necessary for 
		  4anything.com to deliver certain of its services, most of the 
		  information collected is optional with respect to use of the 
		  4anything.com Network. Accordingly, Users can determine to a 
		  large extent what information they wish to submit on a voluntary 
		  basis to 4anything.com.<br>
		  <br>
		  In addition to the initial registration process,
		  4anything.com occasionally asks Users for personal
		  information at other times, including when they
		  complete optional survey forms or fill out optional
		  contact forms for additional information on
		  particular products and services.<br>
		  <br>
		  <b>"Cookies"<br>
		  <br>
		  </b>"Cookies" are small pieces of information that
		  are stored by your web browser software on your
		  computer's hard drive or temporarily in your
		  computer's memory.  The use of cookies is now an
		  industry standard, and Users will find them on most
		  major Websites.  <br>
		  <br>
		  4anything.com sometimes uses cookies to store and track User information.   
		  Cookies enable 4anything.com to personalize the viewing experience 
		  of a User on the 4anything.com Network. When the User revisits the 
		  4anything.com Network, 4anything.com can recognize the User by the cookie 
		  and customize the User's experience at the 4anything.com Network accordingly. 
		  For example, 4anything.com uses cookies to recognize User access privileges 
		  to the 4anything.com Network, track Site usage and traffic patterns, add 
		  advertisements for goods or services of interest, and estimate the 4anything.com 
		  Network's audience size. <br>
		  <br>
		  Although most web browsers are initially set up to
		  accept cookies, if you prefer, a User may decline
		  the placement of a cookie on his or her hard drive
		  by using the appropriate feature(s) of one's web
		  browser software (if available) to delete the
		  cookie.  Users should understand, however, that
		  certain areas within the 4anything.com Network may
		  not function properly if the web browser will not
		  accept cookies.<br><br>
		  <b>Third Party Advertising</b>
		  <br><br>We use DoubleClick and other third-party advertising companies to serve ads when 
		  you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, 
		  email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide 
		  advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. 
		  If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information 
		  used by these companies, please <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">click here</a>.
		  <br><br><b>Third Party Cookies</b>
		  <br><br>In the course of serving advertisements to this site, 
		  our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser.
		  <br><br>
		  <b>Does 4anything.com disclose personal information
		  to third parties?<br>
		  <br>
		  </b>4anything.com discloses publicly available or volunteered technical 
		  or reference information of Users in aggregate form only, and not specific 
		  individual data, to advertisers and certain other third parties.  
		  For example, 4anything.com might tell an advertiser how many males 
		  between 20 and 30 years in age visited the 4anything.com Network 
		  during a particular period of time. <br>
		  <br>In addition, Users are required to disclose certain personal information 
		  through registration in order to participate in promotions or to 
		  request information or a quote from certain third party providers that 
		  offer services through the 4anything.com Network (including requesting an 
		  insurance agent's or contractor's quote or information from a travel agent).  
		  It is necessary for 4anything.com to share this information with one or more 
		  appropriate third parties, who may or may not further transfer the information 
		  to appropriate vendors, in order to enable the vendors to provide the requested 
		  information or quote to the User.  4anything.com does not control these third 
		  parties, and there can be no assurance that certain of such parties will not 
		  solicit users in the future by E-mail or otherwise.  If you do not wish to 
		  have your personal data shared with third parties, you may elect not to 
		  participate in promotions or use services that require the disclosure of 
		  personal data.<br>
		  <br>
		  Except as stated above, 4anything.com does not disclose or transfer 
		  individual personal data records to third parties, unless it reasonably 
		  believes it is required to do so by applicable law or valid legal process 
		  or to protect its property interests.<br>
		  <br>
		  4anything.com deals only with third party advertisers, 
		  retailers or service providers offering for sale products 
		  or services that 4anything.com believes may be of interest 
		  to Users of the 4anything.com Network. Nevertheless, 
		  4anything.com is not and cannot be responsible for the 
		  activities or privacy policies of these third parties.<br>
		  <br>
		  <b>What about external web sites?<br>
		  <br>
		  </b>To the extent that Users click on hyperlinks or banner 
		  advertisements to access third party sites from the 
		  4anything.com Network, Users should understand that these 
		  third party sites may collect personally identifiable information 
		  about them.  Users should further be aware that these third party 
		  Websites are not controlled by 4anything.com and, therefore, 
		  are not subject to this Privacy Policy. Users should check 
		  the privacy policies of these third party Websites to see how 
		  their personal information will be utilized by the proprietors 
		  of these sites.<br>
		  <br>
		  <b>What does 4anything.com do to keep the
		  4anything Network secure?<br>
		  <br>
		  </b>4anything.com has also implemented a number of 
		  security features throughout the 4anything.com Network 
		  to prevent the unauthorized release of or access to 
		  personal information. For example, database information 
		  is kept separate from live servers and is firewall 
		  protected. Also, only authorized personnel have access 
		  to any stored personal information 4anything.com may 
		  collect on its Users. <br>
		  <br>
		  Please be advised, however, that although
		  4anything.com has endeavored to create a secure and
		  reliable Site for its Users, the confidentiality of
		  any communication or material transmitted to/from
		  4anything.com via the 4anything.com Network or
		  E-mail cannot be guaranteed.	When disclosing any
		  personal information, all Users should remain
		  mindful of the fact that it is potentially
		  accessible to the public, and consequently, can be
		  collected and used by others without User consent.
		  Accordingly, Users should consider carefully if
		  they want to submit sensitive information that they
		  would not want disclosed to the public and should
		  recognize that their use of the Internet and the
		  4anything.com Network is solely at their own risk.
		  4anything.com has no responsibility or liability
		  for the security of personal information
		  transmitted via the Internet.  4anything.com,
		  however, urges all of its Users to exercise caution
		  when conveying personal information over the
		  Internet.<br>
		  <br>
		  <b>Can I opt-out of 4anything.com's data collection
		  and/or distribution?<br>
		  <br>
		  </b>As noted earlier, the collection, use, and distribution 
		  of personal data greatly assist 4anything.com in creating 
		  a more, personalized, relevant, and intelligent service.
		   Without the use of personal data, 4anything.com could not
		    deliver certain of its content and services in the most 
			beneficial way. Consequently, 4anything.com does ask for 
			the submission of some personal data.<br>
		  <br>
		  4anything.com does, however, offer Users of the 
		  4anything.com Network the ability to "opt-out" of 
		  having their data collected or used as described 
		  in this Privacy Policy. Registration and the 
		  provision of any personal information is generally
		  voluntary, unless necessary to provide certain 
		  services, such as E-mail. In addition, in the 
		  event that a User wishes to opt-out of 4anything.com's 
		  personal data use and collection practices after 
		  having submitted personal information,  The User 
		  may send an E-mail to
      </font><a href="mailto:4anything-request@news.4anything.com"><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">4anything-request@news.4anything.com</font></a><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">
		  to express his or her desire to opt-out.
		  After receipt and processing of the User's opt-out E-mail, 
		  4anything will refrain from further distributing the User's 
		  personal information to third parties that would otherwise be 
		  permissible under this Privacy Policy but for the opt-out.  
		  4anything is not responsible for the use by third parties of 
		  personal information distributed to them prior to the User 
		  opting-out. <br>
		  <br>
		  <b>What about the collection of personal
		  information from children?<br>
		  <br>
		  </b>4anything.com does not intentionally collect or 
		  maintain information through its 4anything.com Network 
		  from individuals actually known to be under the age 
		  of 13 ("children"). Moreover, at present, no part of 
		  the 4anything.com Network is designed specifically 
		  to target or attract any children.<br>
		  <br>
		  <b>Further Questions?<br>
		  <br>
		  </b>4anything.com welcomes questions or comments
		  Users may have regarding this Privacy Policy or the
