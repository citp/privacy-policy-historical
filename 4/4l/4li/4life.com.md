By entering this site, you consent to the use of your personal information as set forth
below.
You can read our Privacy Policy below to see what information we collect and our
security assurance.
This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personally identifiable information that is
collected by 4Life Research, LLC, and each of 4Life’s subsidiary companies, when you are
on a 4Life website, and when you use 4Life services.
This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that 4Life does not own or
control or to people that 4Life does not employ or manage.
4Life uses information for five general purposes: to customize the advertising and
content you see, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, to contact you
about specials and new products, to maintain and manage the distributor genealogy,
and to allow other distributors to manage their businesses.
Information Sharing. 4Life uses the information we collect solely for our business
purposes. We do not sell or share personal information to third parties other than those
third parties who provide services vital to our business (see Third-Party Providers,
below) and to other distributors (see Other Distributors, below). However, we may also
provide aggregate information and statistics about our customers, sales and related site
information to our third-party providers, but this information and statistics will include
no personally identifying information. Please note that we may release information in
good faith as is reasonably necessary to comply with the law or protect our rights.
Cookies and Sessions. Cookies are essential "invisible" data files that act as an
electronic messenger between your computer and our website. Internet browsers have
a notification option to let you know when an "invisible" cookie is being sent to you.
Through your browser options you can choose not to accept the cookie. However, in not
accepting the cookie, you may not be able to experience all functions of 4Life.com.


Sessions are encrypted and enable us to temporarily save personal information about
you on our server. The most basic session information includes data about what is in
your shopping basket. Each time you login, a new session is created pulling your
information from 4Life’s database. This saves you time, as you will not have to re-input
your Personal Information each time you visit or shop with us. 4Life uses sessions,
rather than cookies, as an enhanced security measure.
We may use your IP address to identify and verify secure logins, help diagnose problems
with our servers, and to administer our websites. Your IP address also may be used to
gather broad demographic information and to recognize customer traffic patterns and
site usage. This information aids us in merchandising and in developing the design and
layout of the site.
Information Collection and Usage. 4Life may collect information from several different
points on our website. This information includes but is not limited to the length of each
visit, how often you visit, which areas of our site you visit, and items that you purchase,
and is collected solely for the purpose of making your 4Life experience the best it can
be. This data helps us make better choices about the information we include on our site.
We also collect and store personal information necessary to process orders you place
and to maintain your status as an independent distributor. This includes your name,
mailing or physical address, email address, telephone number(s), credit card
information, distributor identification number, order history and bonus history. We also
allow distributors the opportunity to post their photo and personal story on their
replicated website if they wish.
In addition, we may also use the information collected to occasionally notify you about
important changes to our website, new services and offers that we feel might interest
you. If you would rather not receive this information, simply follow the directions in the
mailing to unsubscribe from the mailing list. You can also unsubscribe in the Account
Management section of 4Life’s back-office.
Third-Party Providers. 4Life uses the services of third-party providers for certain
services. In order for these third-party providers to perform their functions, we must
provide certain of your personal information to them. These third-party providers
include merchant processing, delivery service providers and our software providers.
Other Distributors. As a network marketing company, 4Life provides certain information
to distributors regarding the other distributors and customers in a distributor’s line of
sponsorship. If you enroll as a distributor with 4Life, your name, rank, email address,
address, telephone number and Life Points purchased will be provided to other
distributors in your upline and/or downline. No other personally identifiable
information will be shared with other distributors.


Security. Whether you place an order or create a profile, we use industry-standard
secure server software (SSL) that encrypts all information you input before it is sent to
the server. In addition, all of the customer data collected is protected against
unauthorized access. Credit card numbers are encrypted and stored in our server for six
months after orders are entered.
No data transmission over the Internet will be 100% secure. While we take steps to
protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information
you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Upon receiving your transmission, we
make all reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our systems. However, you are
ultimately responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your username, passwords and/or
any account information.
To check the security of your connection, look at the lower left-hand corner of your
browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock
(depending on your browser), then SSL is active. You can also double-check by looking at
the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the
site address will change from "http" to "https."
Some versions of browsers and some firewalls do not permit communication through
secure servers like the ones we use to process orders. In that case, you’ll be unable to
connect to the server, which means you won’t be able to mistakenly place an order
through an unsecured connection. If you cannot access the secure server for any reason,
please print our order form and place your order by phone or by fax.
Surveys and Contests. Our site may request information from you via surveys or
contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you
therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information
requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and
demographic information (such as zip code and age). Contact information will be used
to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of
monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site and for our internal
marketing research purposes.
California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance. Because we value your privacy
we have taken the necessary precautions to be in compliance with the California Online
Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to
outside parties without your consent.
Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance. We are in compliance with the
requirements of COPPA (Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act). We do not collect any
information from anyone under 13 years of age. Our website, products and services are
all directed to people who are at least 13 years of age or older.


Online Privacy Policy Only. This online privacy policy applies only to information
collected through our website and not to information collected offline.
Links. Our Site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible
for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when
they leave our website and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site
that collects personally identifiable information from them. This Privacy Policy applies
solely to information collected by this website.
Your Consent. By using our website, you agree to let us collect and use information per
the terms of this privacy policy. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post
changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect and
how we use it.
Making Changes to Your Personally-Identifiable Information. You may update your
personal information as necessary by logging into the Account Management section of

information and have the ability to edit your information. In addition, you may contact
us at distributorservices@4Life.com to update your profile.
Contact Us. If you have any questions about this privacy policy, contact

This Privacy Policy is effective as of April 6, 2010.
