## Section A: Information Collected and How it is Used

Please note that we collect and store certain limited information related to your visits and interactions with our site. What we collect and how we use it is set forth below.

### What we collect if you only browse our site:

If you do nothing during your visit but browse, read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain limited information about your visit. You should know that this information does not identify you personally. We automatically collect and store the following information about your visit:

  1. Your IP address, which is an identifier assigned either to your internet service or directly to your computer. We use the IP address to direct internet traffic to you;
  2. Your browsing behavior, which includes your browser and device characteristics;
  3. The date and time you visited;
  4. The pages or services you accessed; and
  5. Any referring URLs, or sites that directed you to our site.



The information we automatically collect or store is used by us only for improving the content of our site services and to help us understand how people are using our services so that we may continually improve the performance, suitability and usefulness of our sites to you, our customers and potential customers.

### What we collect if you volunteer information:

If, during your visit, you participate in a survey, send an e-mail, or perform some other transaction (see Section C) on-line, the following additional information will be collected:

  1. The e-mail address, and contents of e-mail, for those who communicate with us via e-mail;
  2. Information volunteered in response to a survey or by participating in a contest or other promotion sponsored by us;
  3. Information volunteered during your registration on our site; and 
  4. Information volunteered through an on-line form for any other purpose, including requests to receive samples or marketing information, credit applications, subscriptions to our newsletter, and use of our on-line order forms to order products or services.



We will use your e-mail to respond appropriately. This may be to respond to you or to address issues you may identify, to further improve our site. As an added service to you, we will also use this information to pre-populate on-line order forms to save you time in the ordering and re-ordering process.

### External use of volunteered information:

Please note that there are instances where we share your volunteered information with third parties. 

4IMPRINT, like many internet and catalog retailers, employs other companies and individuals to perform specific functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivery of packages, mail and e-mail, address hygiene, credit card processing services, research that improves the quality of services or offers provided to you, or performing a credit check if requested as part of your order. These providers have access to the information that they require to perform their functions but are strictly forbidden from using it for any other purposes. You may, however, “opt-out” of this use of your volunteered information at any time, but doing so may impair our ability to provide you with proper service and to process your orders (see Section K).

We may disclose your name and mailing address to carefully screened and selected third parties for marketing purposes. However, we never share your e-mail address, phone number, credit card or financial information for these purposes.

## Section B: Personally Identifiable Information and Choice

You may always choose whether to provide personal information to us on-line.

Personal information is information about a natural person that is readily identifiable to that individual. Personal information includes such things as an individual’s name, address and phone number. A domain name or IP address is not considered personal information.

As an example, knowing your name lets us welcome you to our site the next time you visit. This helps us provide a more useful on-line shopping experience and provide you with enhanced customer service.

Please note that we will collect no personal information about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us. You may always choose not to contact us by e-mail, participate in a survey or to provide any personal information using an on-line form. Alternative methods for contacting us in person, by phone or by mail are available by using the information in the Contact Information section at the end of this policy (see Section K). Your choice to not participate in these activities on-line will not impair your ability to browse, read or download content provided via the site.

In the event we are required to respond to a subpoena, court order or other legal process, your personal information may be disclosed pursuant to such subpoena, court order or other legal process, which may be without notice to you.

## Section C: Transaction Information

If you order any information, buy any products or subscribe to any services offered by us via our site, we will ask you to complete an order form that requires certain information, including payment information such as a credit card number and expiration date as well as general contact, billing and shipping information. This information is necessary to complete the transaction and to deliver to you the information, products or services ordered and to collect payment. For your protection, all such information is collected and all credit card information is stored via encrypted means.

## Section D: Review and Correction of Personally Identifiable Information

You can review any personally identifiable information we collect about you by using the information in the Contact Information section at the end of this policy (see Section K). You may recommend changes to your personally identifiable information you believe to be inaccurate by submitting an e-mail or written request that credibly shows the inaccuracy. We will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.

If your personal information changes, you may correct, update or remove the personal data you have provided to us by making changes to your profile or by using an “opt-out” message (see Section K). Our goal is to make sure that our information about you is always current so that we can better serve you.

## Section E: Cookies, Interest-Based Advertising and Opt-Outs

To serve our on-line users, we use “cookies” and other technologies to passively collect demographic information, customize your browsing experience with us, personalize your experience on our site and monitor advertisements and other activities. Cookies are small data files transferred to your computer by your web browser. Most importantly, cookies created on your computer by using our sites or apps do not contain personally identifying information and do not compromise your privacy or security. The exception to this would be where you have registered with us and volunteered personal information, unless you have logged out following your visit or you have disabled cookies during your visit. We use the cookies feature only to store a randomly generated identifying tag on your computer or electronic device. Our third party advertisers may collect anonymous information about your choices on our site through the use of cookies and other technologies to deliver relevant banner advertisements that are tailored to your interests. Our advertising partners are members of the [NAI (Network Advertising Initiative)](http://www.networkadvertising.org/).

Interest-based advertising (also called online behavioral advertising) uses information collected across multiple websites to predict your preferences or infer interests and to show you ads that are more likely to be of interest to you. The NAI provides disincentives to the use of personally identifiable information (See Section B and See Section D) for interest-based advertising. As a result, NAI member companies generally use only information that is not personally identifiable information and do not merge “non-personally identifiable information” they collect for interest-based advertising with users' personally identifiable information. Non-personally identifiable information is information that is not, on its own, used to identify, contact, or precisely locate a particular individual. Used for interest-based advertising by NAI member companies, this data consists primarily of click-stream information (sites you have visited or links you have clicked) that is tied to a randomly generated anonymous identifier. [Find out more about your options](http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/what-are-my-options).

The NAI allows for the central opting out of all of its members’ cookies from a single opt-out page. [Click here to learn more and opt-out of NAI member cookies](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/).

It is also possible for you to disable cookies at your computer or electronic device. Please note that certain features of our site may not work quite as well as we would like, or as well as you would expect, once cookies are disabled. However, the use of cookies is in your control.

## Section F: Electronic Communication

When you access our site or send e-mails to us, you are communicating with us electronically and consenting to receive communications from us electronically. We will communicate with you by e-mail or by posting notices via our site. You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures, or other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing. To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from us if your computer supports such capabilities. If you do not want to receive e-mail from us, please [contact 4imprint](https://web.archive.org/info/contactus).

## Section G: Security and Social Media

We safeguard the integrity of our site to prevent any and all unauthorized access to information maintained by us. These measures are designed and intended to prevent corruption of data and to block unknown or unauthorized access to our systems and information. Credit card information, for example, is transferred to our computers utilizing encryption software (see Section C). We use Digicert® computer security services to establish secure session links between the web browsers of our customers and our site. In this way, all electronic communications are secure. Further, only those of our employees and agents who need access to your information to carry out our business functions are allowed access to that information. We also review our security policies periodically and revised them as required.

However, it is important to recognize that whatever you transmit or disclose online could be collected and used by others or even unlawfully intercepted by third parties. No data transmission over the internet can ever be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us. You may also take steps of your own to protect your information. For example, you should create a quality password and not share that password with others. You should not leave your computer or electronic device unattended before exiting a session and prior to logging out. You should also properly exit browsers as you move between websites. Please see the [4imprint Legal Statement](http://info.4imprint.com/legal-statement/) for additional details.

You should also know that certain social media platforms or features (“Features”), such as the Facebook® virtual button, the Twitter® virtual button and other similar Features buttons may be used to collect your IP address, determine what pages your are visiting and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social media Features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site. Your interactions with social media Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

## Section H: A Special Note for Parents

Although our site is intended for general audiences, we collect no personal information from children under the age of thirteen (13). If we receive any information from persons we believe to be minors, it will be purged from our database in accordance with any applicable laws.

## Section I: Disclaimer

This policy applies only to the 4IMPRINT sites. Although our site may provide links to other sites, be advised that 4IMPRINT is not responsible for the content of such other unrelated sites and is not be liable for any damages or injury arising from that content. Any links are provided merely as a convenience to our users. When you link to another unrelated site, you are no longer on a 4IMPRINT site and this privacy policy will not apply. When you link to an unrelated site, you are subject to, and should consult, the privacy policy of that site, and particularly before providing any personal information.

## Section J: Revision

We may at any time revise the terms and conditions contained in this privacy policy by updating this posting. Accordingly, you should periodically visit this page to review our current privacy policy. The current effective date of this privacy policy is June 30th, 2016.
