The TRUSTe program does not cover information that may be collected through downloadable software.   TRUSTe’s mission, as an independent third party, is to accelerate online trust among consumers and organizations globally through its leading privacy trustmark and innovative trust solutions. If you have questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@iPerceptions.com">support@iPerceptions.com</a>.  If you are not satisfied with our response you can contact <a target="_blank" href="http://watchdog.truste.com/pvr.php?page=complaint">TRUSTe here</a>.</p><p><u>The Scope of This Privacy Policy</u></p><p>This Privacy Policy addresses our use and disclosure of information we collect from you on our websites, <a href="http://www.iperceptions.com" target="_blank">www.iperceptions.com</a>, <a href="http://www.4Qsurvey.com" target="_blank">www.4Qsurvey.com</a>, and through survey responses collected on the behalf of customers who use our service “Customers” and iPerceptions the “Company.”</p><p></p><h2>Information Collection</h2><p></p><p><u>Information Provided by our Customers</u></p><p>If you register for a free 4Q account, we collect your email address and password and may collect certain demographic information, such as your time zone or country.</p><p>If you purchase a paying 4Q account or other service from us, you must provide certain additional personally identifiable information on our order form; in particular, certain contact information (including your name, address, email address, and billing address) and financial information (including credit card number and expiration date), which we use for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you. You will not be able to open an account if you do not provide the information that is identified as required in the account registration and/or purchase process.</p><p><u>Information Provided by Visitors to iPerceptions.com</u></p><p>Visitors to the iPerceptions website may be asked to provide personal contact information in exchange for access to white papers as well as other downloadable content on our site. iPerceptions may use this information for sales and marketing purposes. This information will never be shared with any third party.</p><p><u>Information Provided by Survey Respondents</u></p><p>If you are a survey respondent, we may collect personally identifiable information from you on behalf of our Customer whose survey you have responded to. Our Customers may have their own privacy policies that detail how they handle your personally identifiable information. We encourage you to read any such policy. As between you and us, your submission of personally identifiable information is voluntary and you may opt out of responding at any time. However, if you do respond, you consent to its provision to us for the purpose of delivering our services to our Customer.</p><p><u>Automatically Collected Information</u></p><p>As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, to administer the Site, to understand users’ movements around the Site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.</p><p>We also use “cookies” to help personalize a respondent’s online experience. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on the hard drive of a computer by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p><p>We use a third-party tracking service that uses images, scripts and other tracking technologies to track non-personal information about visitors to our site in the aggregate.</p><p>Our studies require that your browser be set to accept cookies only to ensure that you are not solicited to reply to our <a href="/online-questionnaire/">questionnaire</a> more than once while the current study is running. After that, it automatically expires and our web server can no longer access it. On initial setup, most web browsers are set to accept cookies. As well, you can set an option on most browsers for it to notify you when a cookie is being sent with the option of accepting or rejecting the cookie. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. Please consult the “Help” section of your browser for more information about how to disable cookies. However, our Site will not function as effectively without cookies. Enabling cookies ensures a smooth, efficient visit to our Site.</p><p></p><h2>Children and Parents</h2><p></p><p>iPerceptions’ surveys and websites are not designed or intended for use by children under 13, although the sites we survey may offer children’s products for purchase by adults. If you are under 18, you should not participate in our surveys or use our sites unless a parent or guardian is present. Children under 13 may not submit any personally identifiable information to us, and if we discover that we have inadvertently gathered any such information for a child under 13, we will take appropriate steps to delete it. Children over 13 should only provide us with personally identifiable information if they have explicit permission from a parent or legal guardian. If your child has submitted personal information, and you wish to review, change and/or delete such information as well as refuse to allow any further collection or use of the child’s information, please contact us at the address provided below.</p><p></p><h2>Information Use</h2><p></p><p>In addition to the uses of your information described elsewhere in this privacy policy, we may also use your information in one or more of the following ways. We will not use or share your personally identifiable information in ways unrelated to those described in this privacy policy without your permission.</p><p><u>Communications from iPerceptions</u></p><p>We will use your information to communicate with you and provide you with transactional messages in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. For example, when you register for an account (including a free account), you will receive a short welcome email.</p><p>We will send you service-related announcements when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. If you are a paid subscriber, you may also receive emails regarding your account status and billing. Generally, you may not opt-out of these transactional communications which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.</p><p>We may use your information to contact you about other products or services that we offer and about products and services of third parties in which you may be interested. You may opt out of receiving such communications from us at any time (but not the transactional emails described in the paragraphs above) by contacting us as set out below in the section below entitled “Opting Out of Communications from iPerceptions”.</p><p>We post testimonials on the Site that you submit to us from time to time. We always request permission to post your testimonial on the Site, and we may use your information to contact you for the purpose of requesting such permission.</p><p><u>Use of Online Survey Results</u></p><p>iPerceptions compiles data collected from its online surveys to produce benchmark reports for its Customers as well as media and other interested parties. The information provided by Survey Respondents on our Customers’ online surveys is compiled and aggregated to create generic profiles of the users of the web sites being studied. Open-ended responses are compiled and reported as is. Our study process does not require us to know nor to report the identity of any individual respondent. In addition to the information provided by you, our study tracks user IP addresses, browser type and access time for demographic and web site administration purposes. This information does not contain anything that can identify respondents personally.</p><p>Customers have the ability to export, share, or publish data from their surveys. We provide various <a href="/features/" title="Visit the Features page">features</a> to export, share, or publish your survey questions, responses, and results in summary or detailed format.</p><p>We may also use Customer information, including online survey questions and your respondent’s responses, as well as aggregated data we collect through survey results to help you with your own analysis, and to help us provide and improve our overall services.</p><p><u>IP Addresses</u></p><p>iPerceptions collects IP addresses for system administration and record keeping. Your IP address is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the World Wide Web. Our servers record incoming IP addresses. By tracking IP addresses, we can determine which Web sites refer the most people to iPerceptions. The IP addresses are analyzed in the aggregate.</p><p>iPerceptions also collects the IP addresses of survey respondents on behalf of our Customers.</p><p></p><h2>Information Disclosures</h2><p></p><p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential.</p><p>iPerceptions only shares personal information with third party individuals as disclosed in this Privacy Policy and in the following limited circumstances:<br> When we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of information is reasonably necessary to:</p><p> a) Satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request,<br> b) Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof,<br> c) Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues,<br> d) Protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of iPerceptions, its users or the public as required or permitted by law,<br> e) Allow service providers and/or vendors to fulfill Services for you on behalf of iPerceptions or<br> f) Pursuant to an acquisition, merger, sale of assets or other business transfer.</p><p></p><h2>Opting Out of Communications from iPerceptions</h2><p></p><p>Upon request, iPerceptions will allow any user to opt out from receiving emails about other products and services. You can contact us through our Help Center by email (<a href="mailto:support@iPerceptions.com">support@iPerceptions.com</a>), or follow the unsubscribe instructions included in each promotional email sent to you.</p><p>Survey respondents may also opt-out of receiving future surveys directly from iPerceptions via email.</p><p></p><h2>Accessing, Changing or Deleting your Information</h2><p></p><p>We endeavor to ensure that your personally identifiable information is accurate by collecting it directly from you and providing you with the ability to update it. If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may request us to correct, update, or delete your personally identifiable information or deactivate your account by making the change through your online account page, by emailing our Customer Support at <a href="mailto:support@iPerceptions.com">support@iPerceptions.com</a>, or by contacting us by postal mail at the address listed below. We will endeavor to fulfill requests to delete personally identifiable information unless such information is required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes (such as storage in backup media created as part of our routine system backup procedures). We will respond to your request for access, amendment, or deletion within 30 days.</p><p><strong>Data Retention:</strong> We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at <a href="mailto:support@iPerceptions.com">support@iPerceptions.com</a>.  We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p><p><strong>Public Forums:</strong> Our Web site offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at support@iPerceptions.com.  In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p><p></p><h2>Agents/Service Providers</h2><p></p><p>We use other third parties such as a credit card processing company to bill you for services, and a service provider to administer our help and community support services.  These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.</p><p></p><h2>iPerceptions Security Statement</h2><p></p><p>While no system is completely foolproof, iPerceptions takes the security of the data collected very seriously. We use secure server hosting locations with 24×7 security and monitoring, firewall protection, controlled access and encryption technology to protect your data.</p><p></p><p>We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our PCI Compliant Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. After a transaction, information such as credit cards numbers are not stored on our servers.</p><p>We take reasonable security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of personal information. These measures include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security practices.</p><p>We restrict access to personal information to iPerceptions employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. We take reasonable efforts to ensure all parties comply with confidentiality obligations.</p><p></p><h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2><p></p><p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please check for change notices on a regular basis. If we decide to change our privacy policy in a material way, we will post a prominent change notice on the Site, and we may notify you by email of those changes so that you continue to be aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p><p></p><h2>Links to Other Web Sites</h2><p></p><p>This Site contains links to other Web sites that are not owned or controlled by iPerceptions. Please be aware that iPerceptions is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other Web sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Site and to read the privacy policies of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information.
