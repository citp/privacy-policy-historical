<br>
Gameforge uses your personal information for the establishment, processing and settlement of your user relationship with Gameforge and the processing of payments. Correct execution of the user relationship refers specifically to assuring the players’ full compliance with the terms of use and game rules. We provide you with a client download making participation in one of our games possible and upon installation of this download, a programme protecting against illegal game use and data manipulation can be simultaneously installed in order to avoid manipulation or deceitful use of the game.<br>
<br>
These types of programmes are launched with the game in question and serve exclusively to protect the client- and server- side data of the game. During gameplay, an analysis of the client software, the technical communication of the clients’ and our servers, as well as illegal technical manipulation and help devices (in particular hacks and cheats) can be conducted. Any non-relevant information will not be investigated. Neither the internal game communication nor the data foreign to the game will be evaluated. As long as no change to the client or to the communication between client and server is discovered on your computer, personal data will not be collected and will not be passed on to the game server or to Gameforge. If a violation, in particular a technical manipulation and a violation against the terms of use and game rules, is discovered on your PC, the necessary personal data will be transmitted to Gameforge in order to consequently deal with the infraction.<br>
