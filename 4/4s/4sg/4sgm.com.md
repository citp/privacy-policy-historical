Is It Secure to Shop on 4sgm.com?

_**  
Yes. 4sgm.com uses Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") for secure transmissions. SSL applies encryption to provide confidentiality between two communicating applications, such as your PC and our Internet server. Encryption is defined as a process for scrambling data to prevent illicit entry into a system or interception of information as it travels over the network. That's why you must use an SSL enabled browser to access 4sgm.com. When your data is transmitted over the Internet, it is encrypted at the sending end and then decrypted at the receiving end. 

4sgm.com also carries the [BBBOnLine Reliability seal](http://www.bbbonline.org/cks.asp?id=1060403155446), to provide our customers with assurance that they will have a reliable online shopping experience. 

**_What Are Cookies and Do We Use Them?_**  
**A cookie** is a small piece of information sent by a Web site that is saved on your hard disk by your computer's browser. It holds information a site may need to interact with you and personalize your experience. At 4sgm.com, we use session cookies.

Session cookies exist only for as long as your browser remains open. Meaning, once you close your browser window the cookies (and all its information) disappear. We use session cookies to maintain information we need to have in order for you to shop at 4sgm.com. For example, the Session ID cookie that we ask your browser to record might be the ID for your order. Without the Session ID cookie, you cannot add merchandise to your shopping order and carry it to Checkout. Cookies can be used by a web site to recognize you. But that does not necessarily mean any personal information is stored in the cookies. At 4sgm.com, we store no personal information about you in the cookies. Anything you choose to tell us about yourself (such as your address and e-mail address) is stored safely and separately on our servers. You will be prompted to provide a password to access this information every time.
