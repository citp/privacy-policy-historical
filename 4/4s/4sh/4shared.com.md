# 4shared.com - free file sharing and storage - Privacy Policy

This privacy policy ( **“Policy”** ) explains how personally identifiable information is collected, used and disclosed by New IT Solutions, Ltd. ( **“4shared”** , **“we”** or **“us”** ) with respect to your access and use of 4shared's online file storage and sharing service (the **“Service”** ) so you can make an informed decision about using the Service. 

We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time. We will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on this Policy the date it was last updated. We encourage you to review this Policy from time-to-time to make sure that you understand how any personally identifiable information you provide to us or collected about you will be used. 

**What Is Personal Information?**

As used in this Policy, the term "personally identifiable information" means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, user name or e-mail address), or information about that individual that is directly linked to information that specifically identifies an individual. Personally identifiable information does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Service or about a group or category of services or users, from which individual identities or other personally identifiable information has been removed. This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information. 

**What Information Do We Collect?**

Active Collection: We collect information from you in various ways when you use the Service. For example, we collect information: (i) that you voluntarily provide to us (such as when you send us an email); and (ii) to which you provide us access. Such information may include personal information, such as your name, email address, gender, date of birth, city of residence, social network data and performance related data. Personal and demographic information may also be collected if you provide such information in connection with posting data, providing access to your online groups and other activities in connection with the Service. 

Passive Collection: When you use the Service, some information is also automatically collected, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring website, and your activity on the Service. We may also automatically collect certain logistical information in server logs, including information about how you use various features of the Service and information about the number, frequency and length of each session. 

We may also automatically collect certain information through the use of "cookies." Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive at the request of a website. We only use session cookies, i.e. the cookie files are kept only for the duration of each log-in session to allow you to operate without having to identify yourself at each action you take during that session. Among other things, cookies help us to improve the Service and your experience. If we link cookies to any personally identifiable information, we will treat this information as personally identifiable information. If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser manufacturer to learn about these functions. However, if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services made available via the Service. 

We may use Web beacons or similar technology on the Service. Web beacons are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on the Service or in emails relating to the Service to collect certain information and monitor user activity on the Service, such as to count visits, understand usage effectiveness and to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon. 

Personally identifiable information will be stored on secured servers, and we may store and process personally identifiable information in the United States and other countries. 

**How Do We Use the Personally Identifiable Information We Collect?**

  * with vendors, consultants, and other service providers ("Service Providers") who are engaged by or working with us in connection with the operation of the Service and who need access to such information to carry out their work for us; 
  * when you give us your consent to do so, including if we notify you on the Service that the information you provide will be shared in a particular manner and you provide such information;
  * in an aggregated or anonymized form that does not directly identify you;
