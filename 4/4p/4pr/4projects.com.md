**(1) What information do we collect?**

We may collect, store and use the following kinds of personal data:

**(2) Cookies**

A cookie consists of information sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser on your computer. This information is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the web server. This enables the web server to identify and track the usage of the website in question..

4Projects may use both “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies on their websites. We will use the session cookies to keep track of you whilst you navigate the website. We will use the persistent cookies to enable our website to recognise you when you visit;

Session cookies will be deleted from your computer when you close your browser. Persistent cookies will remain stored on your computer until deleted, or until they reach a specified expiry date.

4Projects makes use of Google Analytics to analyse the use of their websites. Google Analytics generates statistical and other information about website use by means of cookies, which are stored on users' computers. The information generated in this manner is used to create reports about the usage of 4Projects web sites, the use of Google Analytics also allows 4Projects to monitor system performance and can be used to identify areas that can be improved.  Google will store this information securely; their privacy policy is available at:[ http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html](http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html).

With the onset of the EU Cookie law, 4Projects operates on the precept of implied consent.  Rather than explicitly asking each individual user to accept the storing of cookies, this means that continued usage of any 4Projects website implies an acceptance to allow the storage of cookies as detailed within this policy.  For more information about the Cookie law and how it pertains to organisations please refer to the Information Commissioners website available [here](http://www.ico.gov.uk/for_organisations/privacy_and_electronic_communications/the_guide/cookies.aspx).

Most browsers allow you to reject all cookies, whilst some browsers allow you to reject just third party cookies. For example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookies by clicking “Tools”, “Internet Options”, “Privacy”, and selecting “Block all cookies” using the sliding selector. Blocking all cookies will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites, including this one.
