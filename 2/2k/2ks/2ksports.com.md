**What information does Take Two Interactive collect?**

Take Two Interactive only collects personal information from you on a voluntary basis. When you submit personal information to Take Two Interactive, it will usually take the form of: 

• Website registration;  
• Game-specific registration;  
• Newsletter subscription;  
• Participation in contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions;  
• Participation in our message boards or chat rooms;  
• Purchasing a product or service through our online store;  
• Product registration;  
• E-cards and "email this page" features;  
• Technical support;  
• Demo downloads and other program downloads; or,  
• Polls, surveys, or questionnaires. 

The types of information collected in connection with the activities listed above will vary depending on the activity. The information we collect may include personal information such as your first and/or last name, e-mail address, phone number, mailing address, and for those purchasing a product/service online, credit card and shipping information. In addition, we may collect demographic information such as your age or date of birth, gender, occupation, interests, favorite styles of gaming and the systems or games you own or plan to buy. If demographic information is collected for an activity that also requires personal information, we may combine the demographic information with your personal information. On pages where you can send content to a third party; although we ask for a recipient's email address, we don't store this information, but rather delete it from our system after the message is sent. 

Whatever the activity may be and no matter how we use your information, we will only collect information to the extent deemed reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests and our legitimate business objectives. 

• _A Special Note about our Message Boards_

Whenever you give out personal information in public areas such as on a message board or chat room, that information can be collected and used by people you don’t know. While we strive to protect those who wish to participate in these forums, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you post in these areas. 

• _Resumes_

Take Two Interactive allows for the online submission of resumes. Personal information collected from resumes will be used solely for the purpose of accepting and evaluating candidate submissions for job postings, and is therefore not governed by this Privacy Policy. Information obtained from resumes may be shared within Take Two Interactive. 

• _Investor Relations_

Take Two Interactive provides investor relations materials on its websites. Personal information collected on the investor relations’ portion of the Take Two Interactive website is used solely in a business capacity and is not governed by this Privacy Policy. 

• _Email Correspondence_

Take Two Interactive may provide on its websites e-mail addresses to which visitors can send us questions or comments, or which visitors can use to request customer support. In the process of receiving and responding to such requests, we may collect personal information about you, such as your e-mail address or any other personal data contained in the body of your e-mail message. By allowing you to send us these requests, we are not attempting to solicit personal information from you. We only use the information for the purpose of responding to your questions and/or comments or to provide customer support. In most cases, your message is deleted immediately after we've resolved your inquiry; however, in some instances, hard copies of your requests may be kept on file for our records or for quality control purposes. If we have actual knowledge that the person with whom we're communicating is a child, we delete the child's e-mail address and message immediately after responding. 

**What happens if I refuse to provide my personal information?**

Your refusal to submit personal information may limit your ability to participate in some of our activities such as sweepstakes or to purchase a Take Two Interactive product online. However, you do not need to provide us personal information in order to use our websites. 

**Does Take Two Interactive use cookies, track IP Addresses or use other passive means to collect information?**

Take Two Interactive may use cookies on its website. A "cookie" is a small bit of record-keeping information that websites often store on a user’s computer. Cookies generally do not include people’s names, e-mail addresses, or other information that is personally identifiable; they are typically used to quickly identify a user’s computer and to "remember" things about the user’s visit (such as the products placed in your shopping cart). You can always disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your computer; however, disabling cookies may affect your ability to use certain portions of our websites (e.g., online store).

Take Two Interactive may also keep track of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for safety and security reasons. An IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet. 

The only other information that may be passively collected by Take Two Interactive is in the form of logs - files that record website activity, including how many "hits" a particular web page is getting (a.k.a. "navigational data"). These entries are generated anonymously, and enable Take Two Interactive to assess overall website activity and users' browsing habits, track interest in advertised sales, and troubleshoot technical concerns. We also use the log file entries for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the online services we provide you. Log files are used internally only, and are not associated with any particular user, computer, or browser. 

**Who is collecting my personal information and how will it be used?**

When you submit information while on a Take Two Interactive website, you are sharing that information with Take Two Interactive and its various divisions and subsidiaries, including but not limited to Rockstar Games, Gathering, Global Star Software, and Take Two Licensing, unless specifically stated otherwise. As a result of this sharing, you may receive communications from any of Take Two Interactive’s divisions or subsidiaries. Take Two Interactive uses the submitted information to send you promotional materials, to provide you with access to our message boards, to fulfill product orders, and to respond to questions or technical problems. We also use your personal information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the products and services we provide you and to better meet your needs. 

From time to time, Take Two Interactive may receive personal data such as email addresses from other sources or third party companies, and may send the holders of such email addresses notices about Take Two Interactive products. While we strive to provide the same level of protection to the information that we receive from other sources (as we do for personal information collected through our websites), such information is not subject to this Privacy Policy. 

From time to time, Take Two Interactive may employ vendors to collect personal information on Take Two Interactive’s behalf. These vendors provide internal support to Take Two Interactive by operating some of the services we provide you including online product fulfillment and hosting of information collected through the Take Two Interactive websites. Although these vendors, not Take Two Interactive, may collect or maintain the personal information you submit while on the Take Two Interactive websites, Take Two Interactive still requires that they adhere to Take Two Interactive’s stated privacy policies and that they not share your personal information with third parties. 

**With whom does Take Two Interactive share my personal information?**

Take Two Interactive does not share your personal information with any third parties, except as required by law enforcement or other government officials in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or us to legal liability. In addition, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, Take Two Interactive's customer information may be transferred to our successor or assign. 

**Can I choose how my personal information is used?**

If you do not want Take Two Interactive to send you communications such as newsletters or promotional offers, you may opt-out from receiving these communications at the time your personal information is collected or later by contacting us: 

• By phone at 646-536-2842   
• Via email at [privacypolicy@take2games.com](mailto:privacypolicy@take2games.com);or,   
• By regular mail at Take Two Interactive Software, Inc., 622 Broadway, New York, New York 10012. 

In addition, along with every newsletter sent to you, Take Two Interactive gives you the opportunity to discontinue receiving future newsletters. 

**How do I access my personal information?**

If for any reason you wish to view, correct or delete the personal information collected about you, please send an email to privacypolicy@take2games.com, or write to us at Take Two Interactive Software, Inc., 622 Broadway, New York, New York 10012. We will review, update or remove information as appropriate. 

For certain features such as our message boards, you may be able to access and update your personal information using the online "Profile" section of those features. 

**What is Take Two Interactive’s policy regarding links to other sites?**

You should be aware that while you are on the Take Two Interactive websites you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. Because we cannot guarantee that the privacy policies of these websites meet our high standards and the requirements of the ESRB Privacy Online Program, we recommend reading the privacy policy of the website you link to before you submit any of your personal information. 

**Does Take Two Interactive collect personal information from children under 13?**

Take Two Interactive does not knowingly collect personal information from children 12 years old or under. We encourage parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses or phone numbers, without permission, when using the Internet. 

**What safeguards does Take Two Interactive use to protect my personal information?**

To protect your personal information, Take Two Interactive maintains appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of the information you have provided. Our websites have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Personal information collected by Take Two Interactive is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public (e.g., locked rooms). To prevent unauthorized electronic access to personal information, Take Two Interactive maintains information collected online behind a firewall-protected server and uses SSL encryption for purchases made through our online store. 

**How do I ask a question or file a complaint?**

Any questions or complaints about this Online Privacy Statement can be resolved by contacting our Privacy Policy Administrator at 646-536-2842; via email at [privacypolicy@take2games.com](mailto:privacypolicy@take2games.com); or, by regular mail at Take Two Interactive Software, Inc., Attn: Privacy Policy Administrator, 622 Broadway, New York, New York 10012.
