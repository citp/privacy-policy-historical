If you choose to provide us with information, it may be linked to the data stored by these technologies. </p><p>Cookies: A “cookie” is a small bit of record-keeping information that websites often store on a user's computer. Our cookies do not include people's names, e-mail addresses, or other information that is personally identifiable; they are typically used to quickly identify a user's computer and to “remember” things about the user's visit (such as the user’s use of various features on the service). You can always disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your computer; however, disabling cookies may affect your ability to use certain portions of the websites. </p><p>Flash Cookies: We also use flash cookies, also known as “shared objects,” on our sites that employ Flash technology. Flash cookies are small files similar to browser cookies and are used to remember the site's settings to personalize the look and feel of the site. Flash cookies only collect data in the aggregate. Like normal cookies, Flash cookies are represented as small files on your computer and are not tied to your personally identifiable information. One method of preventing Flash cookies from being placed is to adjust your preferences in the Macromedia Website Privacy Settings Panel at www.macromedia.com. </p><p>Web Beacons: A “web beacon” is an electronic image that allows websites to count users who have visited certain pages or viewed certain advertisements. Web beacons, like cookies, do not include personally identifiable information. </p><p>Internet Log Files: The Company may also keep track of your Internet Protocol (IP) and computer MAC addresses for various reasons. An IP address is a number that is used by a networked device and will identify your point of connection to the internet. Depending on your network configuration, it may also identify your computer. A computer MAC address identifies one specific piece of hardware. These log files are not tied to your personally identifiable information. </p><p>Analytic Metrics Tools and Other Technologies: Other information that may be passively collected by the Company includes log files that record information about your hardware, product use or website navigational activity. We also use these log file entries for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the online services we provide you. </p><p>Third-party Advertisers: The Company works with various third-party advertising agents that use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to collect non-personal information. Please click on the links below to learn more about these vendors, their privacy policies, and the ability to opt out of their tracking programs. Please note that the inclusion of a vendor in the list below does not mean that the Company is currently using them as advertising agents or that it is currently conducting any campaigns that use such technologies. We do not have access or control of the third party tracking technologies. </p><p>Mediaplex [http://www.mediaplex.com/AdVault_Privacy_Statement.shtml] </p><p>Yahoo [http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/us/yahoo/details.html] </p><p>DoubleClick [http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/] </p><p>Nielsen/Netratings [http://www.netratings.com/privacy.jsp?section=leg_scs] </p><p>Omniture [http://www.omniture.com/privacy/product] </p><p>ATLAS [http://www.mediaplex.com/AdVault_Privacy_Statement.shtml] </p><p>In addition to visiting the websites of each of the vendors listed above, you may opt-out of certain targeted advertising by multiple thirty party advertising networks at one time if they belong to the Network Advertising Initiative. Visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s website at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a> to select the applicable networks. </p><p><a href="#top">back to top</a> </p><p><a name="whoiscollecting" title="whoiscollecting"></a>WHO IS COLLECTING MY INFORMATION AND HOW WILL IT BE USED? <br>When you submit information to the Company via our Online Services, or information is automatically collected as described in this Privacy Policy, that information is received by the Company. The Company uses the submitted information to send you promotional materials, to provide you with access to our services, to fulfill product orders, fulfill “tell a friend” requests, and to respond to questions or technical problems. We also use your personal information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the products and services we provide you and to better meet your needs. </p><p>Your participation in tournaments or other online game events is conditional upon our collection, use, storage, transmission and public display of statistical data (such as your scores, rankings and achievements) generated through your participation. </p><p>Users of certain Online Services, such as the Rockstar Games Social Club, may be automatically entered into contests as a result of their membership and/or use of certain services. Check www.rockstargames.com/socialclub/events frequently for details regarding contests. </p><p>Online gaming by its very nature is an open community where gameplay information including user name, game activity, and leaderboard rankings are publicly posted for other people to see. Therefore, the Company will post certain information automatically on the specialized game websites, such as your Screen Name or ID and gameplay statistics. However, we will not post information that we know directly and clearly identifies you (such as your real name or email address) unless you provide that information voluntarily for such use. As with other gameplay information services, gameplay and leaderboards generated by our specialized game websites may appear nested in our games or third-party webpages via frames or widgets. </p><p>We may match and/or combine information collected by various Online Services and display it publicly, including on our websites or in game lobbies. For example, if you associate your Company website account with a game console account, your in-game achievements may be displayed combining your website account name with your in-game achievements. </p><p>From time to time, the Company may employ vendors to perform services on the Company's behalf. These vendors provide internal support to the Company by operating some of the services we provide you such as shipping, credit card processing, and email services. Although these vendors, not the Company, may collect, use or maintain the information in connection with the Online Services, the Company still requires that they adhere to the Company's stated privacy policies and that they not share your personal information with third-parties or use the information for their own marketing purposes. </p><p><a href="#top">back to top</a> </p><p><a name="sharedinfo" title="sharedinfo"></a>WITH WHOM DOES THE COMPANY SHARE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION? <br>The Company may also share your personal information with third-parties as described in this Privacy Policy. The Company may share your personal information to fulfill a request you have made, such as a product purchase from the Company store or a providing you with a special ringtone. In the event we offer services or promotions where your personal information is separately collected and used according to the privacy policy of a third-party, we will inform you of that at the time of collection and you may elect not to participate in the service or promotion. In addition, we may share aggregate information (not personal information) regarding site usage statistics and user demographics with third-parties, but this information will not include personally identifiable information. </p><p>We may share your personal information with third-parties, including as required by law enforcement or other government officials in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or us to legal liability.
