  <li><b>2. Personal Information</b><br>
  		You can visit www.21publish.com or any 21Publish hosted Web site without telling us who you are and without revealing any information about yourself. However, to access certain portions of the Web site, you may have to submit information such as user-id and password, or to access some services we provide, you may have to give us personal information such as your name and address and e-mail.<br>
  		To access our services, we may ask you for your address and/or credit card information.

  		</li>
  		
  <li><b>4. Web site traffic information</b><br>
  		When you arrive at any 21Publish hosted Web site, we automatically receive the Web address of the site that you came from.

  <li><b>5. Cookies</b><br>
  		We sometimes use cookies to collect anonymous information from visits to our sites to help us provide better service. We may use this data to analyze trends and statistics and to help us provide better customer service, but we do so in ways that keep the information anonymous. A cookie is an element of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your system. You can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You can also set your browser to turn off cookies. If you do so, however, some areas of some sites may not function properly.
