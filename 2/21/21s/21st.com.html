Ensuring that your SSN and other NPI are secure and private is vital to 21st Century Insurance in meeting our goal of providing you with high quality insurance products and services.</p>


        <p>We at 21st Century Insurance value your trust, and we are committed to the responsible protection of your Social Security number. This notice applies to any SSN that 21st Century Insurance collects in the course of our business. 21st Century Insurance uses customers' SSNs to request accurate credit reports in order to properly rate and underwrite policies.

We also limit access to SSNs by, among other measures, only granting access to SSNs to our employees who use that information to perform their job-related duties. 21st Century Insurance employees who handle a SSN in violation of a 21st Century Insurance policy or procedure may be subject to discipline, up to and including, termination. In addition, we do not disclose SSNs to third parties, except where required or permitted by law.</p>
