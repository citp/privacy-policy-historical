Your privacy on the Internet is important to us. Because we gather certain types of information about the users of 21food's network of sites and services, we believe you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it. 

**Information Collection and Use**

21food collects information from our users at several different points on our web sites. Wherever we collect personal information, we include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page. When you register with one of our sites or sign up to receive one of our newsletters, 21food may ask for your contact information (such as your email address) and your demographic information (such as your zip code, industry, and job function). We use demographic information to tailor your experience at our web site, showing you content and advertisements that we think might interest you. 21food may also ask for such information at other times, such as when you request information or when you decide to purchase products or services from 21food and/or our customers and suppliers. The information collected by 21food may be used in a number of ways. For example, 21food will share broad aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. An example would be where 21food provides partners and advertisers with information about the percentage of men or women who visit our sites, or about the types of industries that users come from. 21food's goal in collecting personal information is to provide you, the user, with the most personalized web experience possible and our advertisers with an efficient means to reach the right audience. By knowing a little about you, 21food is able to deliver more relevant content and advertisements, and hence a better service, to you. 

**Newsletter Subscription**

We may send new registrants and subscribers a welcoming email. We ask our new subscribers in the welcoming email to then confirm their new subscription to the newsletter as a way of protecting them from unwanted emails. New members receive newsletters and product updates from 21food only if they follow the confirmation instructions in the welcoming email. If new members do not wish to receive such newsletters and updates, they do not need to take any action. 

**Promotion and Direct Mail**

Our web sites provide you with the choice to receive promotional emails from 21food. If you choose to receive promotional emails from 21food, you will be giving 21food permission to access your information on behalf of pre-screened third parties for marketing or promotional purposes. We will not share your information with our partners unless you have opted in to receive promotional emails from such partners. If you have chosen to receive such emails and later change your mind, you can remove yourself from this distribution list via a link in the communication or by unsubscribing at this site. 21food and/or its partners may also send direct mailings to your postal address from time to time. If you do not want to receive direct mailings from 21food and/or its partners, you can remove yourself from this distribution list by notifying us through the link set forth below. In addition to 21food, agents working on behalf of 21food under confidentiality agreements, and certain suppliers who are in contract with 21food, may send you carefully selected e-mails or direct mailings about products and services that may be of interest to you. 21food does not control or monitor the newsletter and/or direct mailings or product updates sent by these suppliers. If you do not wish to receive the promotional e-mails or direct mailings set forth above, please click here to opt-out. 

**Orders**

If you make a purchase through our site, the information obtained during your visit to the site, and the information that you give, such as your credit card number and contact information, is used for billing purposes and to fill orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user. In addition, this contact information is provided to third party suppliers and/or fulfillment agents that service your orders and requests. Credit card information will be shared with third parties only as necessary in order to provide the products and services you order. Your contact information may also be provided to the suppliers of content for free downloads of white papers, software or other resources from any 21food websites. These third party suppliers, fulfillment agents and merchants have separate privacy and data collection practices, and 21food has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. 

**Links**

This web site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that 21food is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 

**Tell an Associate**

If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's email address. 21food will automatically send the friend an email inviting them to visit the site. 

**Security**

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry. We use secure servers to protect all of your personal information, including your name, address, email and credit card information. It is generally considered safer than giving your information over the phone. We process your credit card number over our secure server that is the industry standard. Whenever we transmit any credit card information, we use a completely secure transmission method. In order to further protect your personal information, we store your credit card number in a separate location from your registration information. 

**Site and Service Updates**

We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone. 

**Notification of Changes; Conflicts**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes here so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. This page reflects the most up-to-date version of our privacy policy, and thus takes precedence over information provided in P3P documents and other documents.
