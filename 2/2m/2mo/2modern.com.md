2Modern is committed to ensuring the privacy and security of our customers. We value your business and your trust. We will not share or sell your information (period). We continually review and invest in superior technology infrastructure to encrypt and guard your information.

This Privacy & Security statement explains our policies for the collection and use of information as it relates to your interaction with our web site.

**Visiting Our Site  
** When you visit the 2Modern web site, our web server automatically recognizes your domain name when possible. We collect user specific information about the pages you visit as well as any personal information you volunteer while visiting the site.

2Modern collects this information in an effort to provide superior customer service, improve the content of our web site and your shopping experience. We may also use this information to notify you about updates to our web site, special offers or upcoming events. If you do not want to receive promotional emails from 2Modern, you can opt out anytime using the link provided in all newsletter emails.

Shopping Experience  
**If you order a product from us, 2Modern places your name in our secure/encrypted customer database. 2Modern does not share any customer information with any 3rd parties for any reason except for fulfilling an order. For example, FedEx requires shipping information to deliver merchandise purchased on 2Modern.com.

If you supply us with your telephone number or email address online, you may receive a customer service call regarding an order you placed. 2Modern will only contact you to ensure superior customer service and order delivery. We will not call you for any marketing or promotional purposes.

**Security  
**2Modern utilizes the latest technology for shopping and ecommerce security. This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. All orders are transmitted over secure Internet connections using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption technology. All of your personal information including your credit card information and sign-in password are stored in encrypted format at all times. This website, and more importantly all user information, is further protected by a multi-layer firewall based security system. Visa, Mastercard, Discover, American Express and Paypal/Verisign also take significant security measures to protect your information.  
**  
** To ensure that your connection is secure, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), then SSL is active and the server is secure. You can also double-check by looking at the web address (URL) window of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https".  


If you ever are concerned with security or are encountering security problems or concerns with your own computer, please don't hesitate to contact us by phone to place your order: 1-888-222-4410.
