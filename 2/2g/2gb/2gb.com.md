# 2GB.com - Privacy Policy

Macquarie Radio Network Pty Limited owns and operates established Sydney commercial radio stations 2GB and 2CH, through its subsidiaries Harbour Radio Pty Limited and Radio 2CH Pty Limited. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, these entities are referred to as "the Macquarie Radio Network".

The Macquarie Radio Network respects the privacy of its listeners, advertisers and other people we do business with, and we strive to comply with the National Privacy Principles (NPPs) contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (the Privacy Act). This Privacy Policy outlines how the Macquarie Radio Network will handle personal information about you.

As the Macquarie Radio Network may collect personal information online through our websites [www.macquarieradio.com.au](http://www.macquarieradio.com.au/),[www.2ch.com](http://www.2ch.com/) and [www.2gb.com](http://www.2gb.com/), (our websites), this Privacy Policy alsooutlines our approach to online privacy issues.

  


The Macquarie Radio Network needs to collect personal information in order to conduct its business.

**Listeners:**  
The Macquarie Radio Network collects personal information from listeners if you call in to take part in a talk back program, or to enter a competition, or to give us feedback. We collect this information for verification purposes, and generally, we do not retain it.

**Advertisers:**   
If you or your company purchases advertising time from Macquarie Radio Network, we will collect your business contact details. We need this personal information in order to provide you or your company with our services, and to provide you with information about our services and future promotions. Unless you tell us otherwise, we will use personal information about you to market our services to you or your company.

**Business contacts:**  
Sometimes, the Macquarie Radio Group needs to collect personal information from people we do business with. This will usually happen when we collect the name and business contact details of a person who is the contact in an advertising agency, or one of our advertisers, or a government agency or company we deal with, or in one of our contractors or suppliers. Our policy is only to use personal information collected from our business contacts for the business purpose for which it was collected, and not for any other purpose.

**Website users:**  
We may also collect personal information through our website (for example, if you e-mail the Ultimate Gardeners page on the 2GB website).

Our policy is only to use personal information collected from our business contacts or the users of its website for the business purpose for which it was collected, and not for any other purpose.

We do not collect personal information that we do not need.

We will not sell, rent or trade personal information about you to or with others.

Personal information collected by us may be disclosed to third parties to whom we outsource specialised functions (such as mailing houses or printing companies), and if so, we take steps to ensure that those contractors:

  * Comply with the NPPs when they handle personal information about you (regardless of whether they are a small business, and would otherwise be exempt from the NPPs); and 
  * Are authorised only to use personal information in order to provide the services or to perform the functions required by us. 



The only other time we would make disclosures of personal information is if we are required to do so by law, or if the disclosure is permitted under the Privacy Act.

The Macquarie Radio Group takes steps to ensure that the personal information it holds is secure from unauthorised access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure. We only permit your details to be accessed by authorised personnel.

Under the Privacy Act, you have the right to seek access to information which we hold about you (although there are some exceptions to this). You also have the right to ask us to correct information about you which is inaccurate, incomplete or out of date.

Please note that the personal information we hold about you will be information that you have provided us.

We will assume (unless you tell us otherwise) that your request relates to our current records about you. To provide you with access to "current" personal information, we would ordinarily provide you with a print-out of the relevant personal information from our databases, or with photocopies of records which are held only on paper files. We may charge you for the cost of providing this type of access, but this will depend on the scope of your request.

For legal and administrative reasons, we may also store records containing personal information in our archives. You only have a legal right to seek access to personal information about you collected by us prior to 21 December 2001 if we use or disclose that personal information after that date. If you do wish to seek access to personal information collected by us prior to 21 December 2001, please contact our Chief Operating Officer to discuss whether access may be available. Please note that if we do provide access to old records, we may charge you for the cost of providing such access.

As noted above, our websites may collect personal information (eg if our listeners email us).

No personal is stored on our server, unless authorised by the sender. If authorised, the only information stored is first and last name, email address, state and country.

We may change this Privacy Policy at any time. We will make this Privacy Policy available to anyone who requests it, either at our offices or through our websites.
