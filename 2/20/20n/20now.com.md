20now collects and uses your personal information to operate its website(s) and deliver the services you have requested.

20now may also use your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from 20now and its affiliates. 20now may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.

##  **Use of Cookies**

The 20now website may use “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize 20now pages, or register with 20now site or services, a cookie helps 20now to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same 20now website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the 20now features that you customized.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the 20now services or websites you visit.

##  **Security of your Personal Information**
