**Third Party Disclosure of customer information**

We do not provide your individual data to any unauthorized third parties, with the obvious exception of third party business partners. For example authorized parties include our third party credit card processor, autoresponder service and webhost. 

We will not otherwise disclose our customers or subscribers personal and account information unless we have reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, make contact with, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing harm or interfering with the rights or property of our business, our customers, or others, or have a good faith belief that the law requires such disclosure.

We disclaim any intention to censor, edit or engage in ongoing review or surveillance of communications stored on or transmitted through its facilities by customers or others. Our business will, however, review, delete or block access to communications that may harm our business, its customers or third parties.
