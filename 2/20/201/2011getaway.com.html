<p>Caribbean Cruise Line (CRC) Privacy Policy&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;<br>
  This site is owned and  operated by CRC. Here at CRC, we recognize that many visitors to our Site are  concerned about both the information they provide to us and how we treat that  information. So we've developed the Privacy Policy described below. We may  update or change the Privacy Policy from time to time, so please check in  occasionally. </p>
<p>If you have any questions  about our Privacy Policy, you can contact us at: <br>
Caribbean Cruise Line<br>
PO Box 70038, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33307<br>
Attn: Caribbean Cruise Getaway Department</p>
<p>Our office is open from 9  a.m. - 5 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, Monday through Friday. Please feel free to  e-mail us anytime at <a href="mailto:Policy@CaribbeanCL.com">Policy@CaribbeanCL.com</a> . We'll be happy to answer your questions or hear your concerns. <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  Our Policy&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  Caribbean Cruise Line (CRC) respects the privacy of every individual who visits our Site  or responds to our interactive advertisements. At our Site, we don't collect  personally identifiable information from individuals unless he or she provides  it to us voluntarily and knowingly. We don't require you to register or provide  information to us in order to view our Site. <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  Why you might furnish  personally identifiable information to us. <br>
  If you choose to respond to  one of our interactive advertisements or promotions, confirm a reservation  online, or make an inquiry through our website, we will need some personally  identifiable information to respond. <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  CRC regards all personally  identifiable information as confidential and maintains it under strict  conditions of security. CRC treats all personally identifiable customer  information as confidential business information. CRC has implemented strict  security measures intended to prevent an unauthorized third party, such as a  hacker, from gaining access to CRC data bases. We regularly monitor access to  such information and its use within CRC by its employees to ensure that personally  identifiable information is securely maintained and used only as permitted  under this privacy policy. When CRC provides personally identifiable  information to a third party organization (as discussed below), CRC requires  the third party organization to adhere to security requirements comparable to  those imposed by CRC, and to use the information only as expressly authorized  by us. We regularly monitor the third party organizations to ensure compliance  with their contractual commitments to security and proper use.  &nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  How we use personally  identifiable information you furnish to us. <br>
  We use personally  identifiable information supplied by you ONLY as follows: </p>
<p>As necessary to respond to  your inquiry, and make a record of it. In the email section of our Site, we ask  for some personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, and  phone number. We use this information only if we need to contact you directly  because our attempts to contact you by email were unsuccessful. We may share  your personally identifiable information with individual CRC properties in  order to reply to your inquiry. As necessary to provide any goods or services,  including hotel reservations, that you have specifically requested, and to make  records of these transactions. (For example, we would use the information that  you provide to mail you a reservation confirmation, or to respond to an email  question. This may include providing the necessary information to individual suppliers  as necessary to provide the goods or services. To permit CRC or others to  provide other information about goods or services that are related to the  services that CRC offers. This is called "Marketing Opportunities"  in this privacy policy. Marketing Opportunities do not include - and CRC  expressly prohibits the companies offering them from using your personally  identifiable information for - products or services of theirs other than those  CRC has expressly authorized. For inclusion in statistical or demographic  profiles that CRC uses for general marketing purposes. Although personally  identifiable information is used to compile the profiles, we use the profiles  only as aggregate data, without reference to personally identifiable  information, or for targeted Marketing Opportunities. <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  You may "opt out"  at any time. <br>
  You may notify CRC at any  time that you no longer wish to receive Marketing opportunities. You may do so  by writing to CRC at <br>
  Caribbean Cruise Line<br>
  531 SE 5th Court, Pompano Beach, FL 33060<br>
  Attention: Marketing Dept.  Email Removal </p>
<p>Or you may telephone CRC at  1-???-???-???? , or email Remove@Caribbeancl.com with a request to "  remove." <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  We limit third party access  to personally identifiable information. <br>
  We don't share any  personally identifiable information you give us with anyone outside of CRC  other than: </p>
<p>Third party organizations  that CRC engages to perform services on CRC's behalf. <br>
  Third party organizations  that store data on CRC's behalf. <br>
  Third party organizations  that provide Marketing Opportunities. <br>
  When CRC is required by law  to do so.<br>
  In CRC's contracts with  third party organizations the third party organization may use personally  identifiable information collected on our website only for the express purpose  permitted by its contract with CRC, which will be consistent with this privacy  policy. As noted, CRC's contracts also require each third party organization  to maintain all personally identifiable information as confidential under  strict security conditions and in accordance with CRC's privacy policy. <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  CRC does not seek  children's personally identifiable information. <br>
  CRC does not intend to  collect any personally identifiable information from individuals under thirteen  years of age. Where appropriate, we will specifically instruct children not to  submit such information on our websites or advertisements. If a child has  voluntarily provided us with personally identifiable information, a parent or  guardian of that child may contact us at the street address, telephone number,  or email address listed above to request that this information deleted from our  records. We will use all reasonable efforts to delete the child's personally  identifiable information from our data bases, including those maintained by  third parties on our behalf. <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  Credit Card Security. <br>
  CRC uses secure socket  layer (SSL) technology to process credit card transactions initiated through  our Site. SSL is the industry standard for secure e-commerce transactions. It  prevents your personally identifiable information from being read by someone  else as it travels across the Internet. Among other security measures, all  personally identifiable information that you supply in a credit card  transaction, including credit card number, name, and address, is encrypted <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  Our use of  "cookies" and "pixels." <br>
  Like most companies, we (or  third party organizations that we engage) use "cookie" technology on  our Site. When you log in, the cookie tells us whether you've visited us before  or are a new visitor. The cookie doesn't track any personally identifiable  information about you or provide us with any way to contact you, and the cookie  doesn't extract any information from your computer. </p>
<p>CRC uses transparent GIF  files (called "pixels") to help manage online advertising. Ordinarily  an advertising management partner provides the pixels. These files enable the  advertising partner to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in  turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website. </p>
<p>The information that we  collect and share using cookies and pixels is anonymous and not personally  identifiable by CRC or the advertising partner. It does not contain your name,  address, telephone number, or email address. <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  Traffic Data<br>
  Data about traffic and usage  are not personally identifying or identifiable, and are not supplemented or  combined with personally identifying or identifiable information. CRC may  share information it collects with certain selected third parties, but only in  aggregated, anonymous form, without any personally identifiable information.  CRC provides the aggregated data to third parties for analysis of use of the  site. (For example, we may tell an advertiser that a certain number of people  visited a certain area on our Web site, or searched Web sites for the term  "hotel.") CRC collects some information regarding use of the  Services by observing browser functions and the files (pages) that user’s  access. For example, CRC's servers collect information about the site from  which a user entered to enable CRC to calculate and pay its affiliates,  information about the most frequently searched terms to help our advertisers  provide the most relevant search results, information about usage to check for  fraudulent behavior or other abnormalities, and to ensure that our Services are  technically superior. CRC, either itself or with contracted third party  service providers, uses the information (in aggregate form, without any  personally identifiable information) to improve the Services. </p>
<p>Third party advertising  companies under contract with CRC may also employ technology that is used to  measure the effectiveness of ads. Any such information is anonymous, without  any personally identifiable information. The advertisers may use this anonymous  information about users' visits to this and other sites to provide  advertisements about goods and services of potential interest. No personally  identifiable information is collected during this process. The information is  anonymous and does not link online actions to an identifiable person. <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  Changes in the privacy  policy. <br>
  CRC reserves the right to  change its privacy policy at any time. We will post advance notice of any  change on our Site. We will apply any change prospectively only; any  information that you have submitted prior to the change will be used and  disclosed only as permitted by the privacy policy then in effect. <br>
