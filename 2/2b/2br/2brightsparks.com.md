The data collection process mentioned in this article can be either performed by 2BrightSparks and/or its affiliated companies (hereinafter referred to as “we”, “us”, “our”). 

**Collection, processing and passing on of personal data**  
Generally, you can visit our website (www.2brightsparks.com) without leaving any personal data. Personal data is only collected if you give it voluntarily, for example:

The information is used by **FastSpring** to complete the transaction and the order receipt email is sent to your email address, while your full name and company (if any) will be displayed in your invoice. We generally do not collect addresses but on some occasions, customers may contact us and explicitly request that we include their address in the invoice, which we will comply upon request. FastSpring do not provide the payment details to 2BrightSparks. We do not receive or record credit cards numbers or other payment details. We do record your name and emal address. This information helps with customer support, license verification and subscriptions.

When you provide us with personal identifying information in an e-mail or ticket support, we use the information to locate your records and provide you with answers to your questions. We use third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary networking, storage, query and retrieval of these records. When you submit a ticket to our support channel, your information (like name and email address) will be captured by our customer support partner, FreshDesk.

We have an active forum that runs on phpBB, an open source forum software. When you visit our forum and signup as a forum member and/or submit postings, we may collect your information based on what you submit to us. Your forum account will contain a uniquely identifiable name (user name), a personal password used for logging into your account and a personal, valid email address.

In all cases, you have the option to decide what information in your account is publicly displayed. Furthermore, within your account, you have the option to opt-in or opt-out of automatically generated emails from the phpBB software. Our forum also supports signing in using your social network account (Facebook, Twitter, etc), in which case, your login information is stored by OneAll and your data protection falls under their privacy policy.

We have an affiliate program where resellers can sign up as our affiliates to earn commission for reselling our products. This program is hosted by Impact, our affiliate management partner.
