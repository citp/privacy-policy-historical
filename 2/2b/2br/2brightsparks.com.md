**Support**  
2BrightSparks Pte Ltd. operate a ticketing system that allows users of our commercial software to request information and support. Users are required to register their name and email address using a double opt-in process that ensures support emails are only sent to the owner of the e-mail address. 

Information about the support subscriber is used exclusively for support ticketing and not shared elsewhere. The registration for the 2BrightSparks mailing list, for example, is kept separately. 2BrightSparks never discloses email addresses unless required to do so by law. 

When technical information is provided to 2BrightSparks support staff, no personally identifiable information is given to anyone outside 2BrightSparks Pte Ltd. Support staff will never login to the user's website, system, or computer via FTP or other networking means without an explicit request by the user. 

A third party may need to be contacted by technical support staff in their efforts to resolve a support issue. In such cases, all personally identifiable information is removed.
