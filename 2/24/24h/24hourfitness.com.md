# Privacy Policy

Welcome to 24HourFitness.com! We want 24HourFitness.com to be your source for health and fitness information, products, services and tools. We know that your privacy is important to you, so your privacy as you use our site is very important to us. This privacy policy describes what information we gather from you, how we use that information and what we do to protect it. We hope that this privacy policy is straightforward and clear, but if you have any questions about it, please e-mail [Chief Privacy Officer](mailto:cpo@24hourfit.com). 

**Information We Gather**

_Personally Identifiable Information_  
In order to become a member of 24HourFitness.com and have access to our members' only areas, we ask you to register with our site and provide your e-mail address and name. We also ask for your 24 Hour Fitness Club membership number (if you are a member) in order to help us enhance your use of our site and clubs. This Registration Information is personally identifiable information because it allows us to contact you and distinguish you from other users. 

You may also buy health products and club memberships on our site. If you make purchases through 24HourFitness.com, we need to gather information relating to the sale, including what you are buying, how you are paying and where you would like the products shipped. However, we will use that Transactional Information only to complete the transaction, to provide you with an order history and to facilitate future orders. We may also use information about the transaction for aggregate reporting (where we summarize the data in a report that does not contain your personally identifiable information).

If you are a member of 24HourFitness.com, you may enter contests. If you enter a 24HourFitness.com contest, we record your entry and link it to your 24HourFitness.com Registration Information.

We may receive additional personally identifiable information from you through communications with 24HourFitness.com. If so, we will use that information to fulfill your request and for aggregate reporting before deleting it from our active system. For example, if you e-mail 24HourFitness.com to ask about an article or tool, we will use that information to give you an answer, to make sure that you are satisfied with our answer, to have a history of our service to you and to make our service better by reporting your request, without any personally identifying information, in our customer service totals.

_Other Information_  
In order to maintain and improve 24HourFitness.com, we also gather some statistical data when you visit the site. The exact information we collect may vary, but can include the date and time of an access to our site, the Internet Protocol address of a computer requesting a page, the pages requested, and computer and connection information such as browser type and operating system. We do not associate this statistical information with your personally identifiable information.

Also, if you respond to a poll, we will aggregate your responses with those of other 24HourFitness.com members but we do not associate your response with any personally identifiable information.

_Public Information_  
24HourFitness.com provides you with many ways to submit information to be posted on our site including participating in our forums and asking our experts a question. In each of these circumstances, 24HourFitness.com gathers information from you. Be aware that anything you submit to 24HourFitness.com through these services may be made public, so please remember not to include any information you want kept private. Information submitted to forums or experts can be read, recorded and used by any third party or by 24HourFitness.com.

_Activity Tags_  
Like many web sites, we use "activity tags" (also called "Spotlight tags"). These invisible tags provide information to third parties about the flow of users on our site and other web sites. 24HourFitness.com also receives reports generated from that information. Information collected through the use of activity tags on our site is never linked to any personally identifiable information you provided to 24HourFitness.com.
