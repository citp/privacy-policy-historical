**Personally Identifiable Information** **  
** Privacy concerns center on information that can be associated with a particular individual or entity. This information is often referred to as "personally identifiable information" and includes, for example, such things as a customer's name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address.

**Disclosure** **  
** 247-host.com will not disclose to outside parties any personally identifiable information obtained from the registration for or use of 247-host.com's services without the consent of the customer (except as required by subpoena or other legal process, cases where 247-host.com suspects fraud, or in the case of imminent physical harm to customers or others). When 247-host.com uses agents, contractors or other companies to perform services on its behalf, 247-host.com will require that they protect your personally identifiable information consistent with this Policy.

**Collection and Use of Personally Identifiable Information**  
247-host.com collects and uses personally identifiable information obtained from you and from other sources for billing purposes, to provide and change service, to anticipate and resolve problems with your service, or to identify, create and inform you of products, services or special offers that better meet your needs. 247-host.com will not sell or disclose any of your personally identifiable information to other companies or organizations without your consent, unless compelled by a court order or subpoena. We reserve the right, however, to convey any information we collect from or about you to a successor-in-interest or business partner.
