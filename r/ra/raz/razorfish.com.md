# Privacy

_Last updated October 20, 2008_

Razorfish and its affiliates are committed to protecting users’ privacy, and we want to keep you informed of our privacy practices through this web site. This privacy policy applies to those Razorfish and affiliate web sites that link to this notice. We encourage you to read this policy to ensure you understand our privacy practices.

Some of our clients provide Razorfish and its affiliates with personally identifiable information about their customers so we can perform various services such as online campaign analysis. In addition, as part of our services, we may collect information about user interaction with client web sites and provide that information along with our analysis to the client. All of this information belongs to the client and, as their customer, you should review the privacy policies of the sites you visit. Razorfish and its affiliates make no other use of this personally identifiable information.

The responsible use of cookies and web beacons (aka: action tags or pixel gifs) plays an important role in the services Razorfish and its affiliates provide to clients. Our services allow our clients to better serve you, their customer. Razorfish and its affiliates may use cookie and web beacon technology for planning, serving, analyzing, and managing online campaigns on behalf of our clients. For more information about the use of cookies, web beacons, and how you can opt out of Atlas cookies, please review the Atlas privacy policy. In addition, depending on your web browser, you may be able to change how your computer treats cookies so that cookies are not used or saved. Please check with your browser provider for more information on managing cookies.

**EMAIL SERVICE ON BEHALF OF RAZORFISH OR AFFILIATE CLIENTS  
**When we conduct an e-mail campaign for our clients, we generally use e-mail service providers. Razorfish or its affiliates may use cookie and web beacon technology provided by Atlas to track the campaign's effectiveness. Generally, we do not have access to the e-mail addresses or any personally identifiable information and do not associate cookie data with any person. If we handle the e-mail addresses ourselves in conjunction with an online campaign, we do not use Atlas technology for analysis of the campaign's effectiveness, but rather rely on the e-mail service provider or the client's own cookie or web beacon technology to do so. This ensures that no personally identifiable information of our clients’ customers is associated with Atlas cookies for any purpose.

**RAZORFISH AND AFFILIATE WEB SITES  
**The Razorfish and affiliate web sites provide users with information about products and services, as well as company contact information. We do not collect personal information unless you provide it to us for items such as newsletter subscriptions. We will express our need for the personal information at the point of collection and will not collect more personal information than is needed to execute your request.

Personal information is any information that can be used to identify an individual, and may include, but is not limited to, name, email address, postal or other physical address, telephone number and other information required to provide a service, deliver a product, or carry out a transaction you have requested.

We will only use your personal information in the way we specified when it was collected. We will not subsequently change the way your personal information is used without your consent.

We may respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process by disclosing your personal information and other related information, if necessary. We also may disclose your personal information to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.

**POLICY UPDATES OR CHANGES  
**Razorfish and its affiliates may update or change this privacy policy at any time and such changes will become effective 30 days after they are posted unless otherwise stated. Our web site will state the date it was last updated and we encourage you to review our privacy policy whenever you use this web site.

We hope you find this information helpful. Our goal is to present all the information in a format that is as readable as possible. Whatever you decide to do, we want you to be completely informed about how cookies work, and how we use information on the Internet. Should you have any additional questions, please send an e-mail to [privacyinfo@razorfish.com](mailto:privacyinfo@razorfish.com) or write us at:

A web beacon is a clear gif not visible to the user, which collects certain anonymous information about your visit to our web sites.

These tracking technologies collect anonymous data about users who interact with our web sites to help us provide a better user experience through the use of statistics and measurements of user satisfaction.
