<h1><b>Learning A-Z Privacy Statement</b></h1>
<p>Learning A-Z obeys a strict code of privacy in regards to the information 
collected for customers and visitors to any Learning A-Z website: Reading A-Z, 
Raz-Kids, Reading-Tutors, Vocabulary A-Z, and Writing A-Z. The following 
outlines what information we collect, what we do with it, and how you can 
determine how information about you is used. </p>
<p><b>Information Collection and Use:</b> Learning A-Z is the sole owner of the 
information collected on its website. We will not sell, share, or rent this 
information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this 
statement. Learning A-Z collects information from our users at several different 
points on our website. </p>
<p>Learning A-Z websites are directed at adults and educators, and with the 
exception of Raz-Kids, are not directed to children under the age of 13. All 
Learning A-Z websites, including Raz-Kids, operate in compliance with the 
Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. Learning A-Z will not knowingly 
collect or use personally identifiable information from anyone under 13 years of 
age. </p>
<p><b>Registration:</b> If you wish to download materials or resources, make a 
purchase, participate in a contest, or receive information, we will ask you to 
register. During registration you will be required to provide your contact 
information (such as name and email address). This information is used to 
contact you about the services on our websites for which you have expressed 
interest. </p>
<p><b>Subscribe:</b> We request information from you on our order form. During 
subscription registration you may be required to provide your contact 
information (such as name and email address), and how you would like to pay for 
your subscription (credit card, check, purchase order, etc.). </p>
<p><b>Cookies:</b> Learning A-Z websites use cookies to create a more enjoyable 
user experience. A cookie is a small data file that websites write to your hard 
drive when you visit them. Cookies allow our websites to remember important 
information about you that makes your use of our website a more satisfying 
experience. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our 
users to enhance the experience on our website. In many ways, cookies have 
become a way of life on the Web. Their use is now an accepted industry practice 
and is common among most of the major Internet websites. You can set your 
browser to warn you before accepting cookies, or even to decline cookies from 
websites on the Internet. However, if a user rejects cookies on a Learning A-Z 
website, login and use of the website cannot be enabled. </p>
<p><b>Log Files:</b> We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the 
website, track users movement, and gather broad demographic information for 
aggregate use. </p>
<p><b>Sharing:</b> We do not share aggregated demographic information with 
anyone. We use an outside credit card processing company to bill users for goods 
and services. These companies do not retain, share, store, or use personally 
identifiable information for any secondary purposes. </p>
<p><b>Surveys &amp; Contests: </b>From time to time, we request information from 
users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is 
completely voluntary, and you have a choice whether or not to disclose this 
information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name 
and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age 
level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. 
Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use 
and satisfaction of Learning A-Z websites. </p>
<p><b>Security:</b> Learning A-Z takes every precaution to protect our users’ 
information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your 
information is protected both online and off-line. When our registration/order 
form asks users to enter sensitive information, that information is encrypted.
</p>
<p>While we use encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do 
everything in our power to protect user information off-line. All of our users’ 
information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted 
in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific 
job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are 
granted access to personally identifiable information. </p>
<p>Learning A-Z does not store credit card information in our database. This is 
to both reduce our liability and protect your interests. </p>
<p>If you have any questions about the security at any Learning A-Z website, or 
the order process, please email <a href="mailto:support@learninga-z.com">
support@learninga-z.com</a>. </p>
<p>Notification of Changes: If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will 
post those changes each Learning A-Z website home page so our users are always 
aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what 
circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use 
personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at 
the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will 
have a chance to inform us not to use their information in a different manner. 
We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy in place when the 
information was collected.</p></td>
