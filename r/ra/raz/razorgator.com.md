Online Surveys   
Razorgator values opinions and comments from customers, so we frequently conduct online surveys. Participation in these surveys is entirely optional. Typically, the information is aggregated and used to make improvements to Razorgator and to develop appealing content, features, and promotions for customers. Survey participants are anonymous unless otherwise stated in the survey. 

Promotions & Sweepstakes   
Razorgator frequently sponsors promotions and sweepstakes to give customers the opportunity to win Hard-To-Get® tickets and related prizes. We collect and maintain personal information about you through the operation of these promotions and sweepstakes in order to enable us to provide you with the best service. We also collect personal information for other activities that include contacting you, conducting survey questions, collecting other marketing data and other uses detailed throughout this privacy policy. From time to time, marketing emails will be sent to your email address provided upon entry into the promotion or sweepstakes. We use contact information to notify contest winners and survey information to develop promotions and product improvements to the Razorgator.com web site. 

If the promotion or sweepstakes is conducted in conjunction with a celebrity, any personal information we obtain through the promotion or sweepstakes may be shared with the celebrity or the agency who promotes the celebrity. For example, if we run a promotion endorsed by celebrity “X”, your name and email address would be shared with the agency who promotes celebrity “X”. 

Before entering a particular promotion or sweepstakes, you should first refer to its Official Rules: [/tickets/sweepstakes-terms-conditions/](https://web.archive.org/tickets/sweepstakes-terms-conditions/). 

We only collect personal information that is voluntarily provided to us. You can opt-out of receiving promotional emails, or otherwise sharing your personal information, by following the steps detailed below in the privacy policy. 

Automatic Logging of Session Data   
We automatically log generic information about your computer's connection to the Internet, which we call "session data," that is anonymous and not linked to any personal information. Session data consists of things such as IP address, operating system and type of browser software being used and the activities conducted by the user while on our site. An IP address is a number that allows computers, such as our web servers, know where to send data back to the user via the internet, such as the pages on the site that the user wishes to view. We collect session data because it helps us analyze such things as what items visitors are likely to click on most, the way visitors are clicking through the site, how many visitors are surfing to various pages on the site, how long visitors to the site are staying and how often they are visiting. It also helps us diagnose problems with our servers and lets us better administer our systems. Although such information does not identify any visitor personally, it is possible to determine from an IP address a visitor's Internet Service Provider (ISP) and the approximate geographic location of his or her point of connectivity. 

Cookies   
"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. There are many myths circulating about cookies, but you should know that cookies are only read by the server that placed them, and are unable to do such things as run programs on your computer, plant viruses, or harvest your personal information. Razorgator uses cookies to help analyze our web page flow, to measure promotional effectiveness, and to foster trust and safety. 

First and foremost, you can rest assured that no personally identifiable information ("PII") about you (e.g., name, address, etc.) is gathered or stored in the cookies placed by the Razorgator.com web site and, as a result, none can be passed on to any third parties. 

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies. Of course, by changing the options on your web browser or using certain software programs, you can control how and whether cookies will be accepted by your browser. Razorgator supports your right to block any unwanted internet activity, especially that of unscrupulous websites. However, blocking Razorgator cookies may disable certain features on our site and may make it impossible to purchase or use certain services available on the site. Please note that it is possible to block cookie activity from certain web sites while permitting cookies from sites you trust, like Razorgator. 

General information Razorgator collects and why   
“General Information” is information about you or your activities on our site that do not identify you personally. When you use the internet, your web browser or software may communicate certain information to the host website you visit. Examples, of General Information include the unique number assigned to your server or Internet connection, the capabilities and features of your computer, you geographic location, and your movement and activity within a particular website. Likewise, when you register as a customer of Razorgator, enter certain sweepstakes and promotions, or complete offers like email newsletter subscriptions, we collect general information about you such as age, gender and zip code. We collect and store this information to generate statistics about visitors to our site for non-personal demographic purposes. 

How long your personal information is kept   
We generally keep user data on our server or in our archives for as long as we reasonably need it. We may alter this practice according to changing requirements. For example, we may delete some data if needed to free up storage space. We may keep other data for longer periods if the law requires it. In addition, information posted in a public forum could stay in the public domain indefinitely. 

Data management requests are administered in an orderly manner to the extent feasible and within our direct control. Please note that we have greater control over recently collected data than over archived data. Once data is removed from the system and archived, it may not be feasible to accommodate specific requests. In those cases, our general data retention policy applies.

Protection against the misuse of customer information   
Razorgator contains links to other websites. Please note that when you click on one of these links, you are entering another website for which Razorgator has no responsibility. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of all such sites as their policies may be materially different from this Privacy Policy. Of course, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and your Razorgator membership account information. Please be very careful, responsible, and alert with this information, especially whenever you're online. In addition to the circumstances described above, Razorgator may disclose client information if required to do so by law, court order, as requested by other government or law enforcement authority, as requested in connection with any governing entity regulating ticket distribution to any event or in the good faith belief that disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable including, without limitation, to protect the rights or properties of Razorgator or its affiliated companies or when we have reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing interference with our rights or properties, whether intentionally or otherwise, or when anyone else could be harmed by such activities. Further, if Razorgator or substantially all of its assets are acquired, our customer information will most likely also be transferred in connection with such acquisition. 

In addition to the circumstances described above in the previous paragraph, Razorgator is obligated to collect and provide certain personal information in connection with the sale of any World Cup Ticket for each attendee of a World Cup Event. Specifically, FIFA Federations, Sponsors, the 2006 FIFA World Cup Organizing Committee - Germany, and other venue sponsors regulating ticket and event venues for the World Cup in Germany in 2006 require that each attendee of a World Cup Event provide the following information with respect to each ticket user: (1) name, (2) date of birth, (3) nationality, as shown on attendee's passport, and (4) passport identification number. Accordingly, as a condition to delivery of tickets purchased for any 2006 World Cup event, this information must be provided for each ticket user as part of the checkout procedure, or Razorgator will be unable to deliver the World Cup tickets to you. Please also note that the personal information you provide about each ticket user will be maintained in the United States for processing and dissemination to the governing bodies that require it.
