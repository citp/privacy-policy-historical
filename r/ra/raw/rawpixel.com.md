  4. ### Do we send your personal data overseas?

    1. #### We send your personal data to other countries where:

      1. we store information on computer servers based overseas. Any personal data that you submit to us will be held on secure servers, which may be based in the EU, the USA and at the offices of Photomorphic Services Ltd in Thailand;
      2. staff operating overseas who work for us or for one of our suppliers, fulfil your order, process your payment details and provide support and marketing services.
      3. The European Commission has produced a list of countries which have adequate data protection rules. The list can be found [here](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/adequacy/index_en.htm).

Currently Thailand is not one of the countries subject to an adequacy decision. We only share your data with Photomorphic Services Ltd in Thailand in order for them to support the administration of Our Site. Photomorphic Services is a company under our control and ownership. We ensure that all staff are trained in Data Protection and that all data is handled to the same levels that are required in the UK/EU.

    2. If the country that we are sending your personal data to is not on the list or, is not a country within the EEA (which means the European Union, Liechtenstein, Norway and Iceland) then it might not have the same level of protection for personal data as there is in the UK/EU.
    3. As we are transferring data outside the EEA, we will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with data protection law. Please email us at [contact@rawpixel.com](mailto:contact@rawpixel.com) for further information.
  5. ### How do we keep your personal data secure?

    1. Data security is of great importance to us. To protect your data we have taken suitable measures to safeguard and secure data collected through Our Site. The main location where we store your data is on the AWS RDS service (which has it's own dedicated security team to work on securing the network and applications), which is accessed by the rawpixel servers through a password, and can be accessed only by the rawpixel servers (private network / Firewall / VPC).

We do not see or store any of your credit card data. This is sent directly to our credit card processing vendor, Stripe Payments Europe Ltd. Stripe uses security measures to protect your information both during the transaction and after it is complete. Stripe has been audited by a PCI-certified auditor and is certified to **PCI Service Provider Level 1**. This is the most stringent level of certification available in the payments industry. To accomplish this, they make use of best-in-class security tools and practices to maintain a high level of security at Stripe.

Your Membership account requires a username and password to log in. You must keep your username and password secure, and never disclose it to a third party. We automatically encrypt your password, which means we cannot see your passwords. We cannot resend forgotten passwords either. We will only reset them.

If you have any questions about the security of your Personal Information, you may contact us at [contact@rawpixel.com](mailto:contact@rawpixel.com).

    2. Notwithstanding the security measures that we take, it is important to remember that the transmission of data via the internet may not be completely secure and that you are advised to take suitable precautions when transmitting to us data via the internet.

    1. We may share your data with other companies in our group for the purpose of providing the service to you. This includes our subsidiaries.

If you opt in to our marketing communications you are included in our marketng database that is held with MailChimp and is soley for our use, the database is not shared with any other 3rd party.
