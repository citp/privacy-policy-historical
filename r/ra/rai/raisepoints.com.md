About Cookies and Third Party Technology 

A “cookie” is a small data file that may be saved to and stored on your computer when you visit a website or similar technology or open an email. Cookies permit a website or similar technology operator to “remember” whether your computer has visited the website, tool or service before and helps the operator create a more personalized experience for you and records activities taken by you, such as offers completed. (In all cases in this Privacy Policy, the word “computer” includes all forms and styles of computing technologies including but not limited to desktop computers, laptop computers, tablet devices, smart-phones, other mobile or wearable computing technology.)
