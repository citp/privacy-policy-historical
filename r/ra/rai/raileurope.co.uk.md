7. Cookies
VSL places a "cookie" on your computer to identify when you visit the VSL website. These cookies
are used to aid and identify customer behaviour, trends and demographics. Most, if not all, websites
use cookies for this purpose. A cookie is a piece of data that identifies your computer to our servers.

cookies you will still be able to use the website and book tickets. We reserve the right (and you are
deemed to agree) to match information gathered from cookies with any information you have given
about yourself and to use information gathered from cookies to enhance your use of our website.
Cookies are used by our suppliers and affiliates in respect of which VSL cannot advise and therefore
