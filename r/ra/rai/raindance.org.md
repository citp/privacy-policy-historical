#### Use of anonymous data

We share statistics about our audiences and participants with third parties (such as Arts Council England, BFI and venue partners) to report on our work, which may include data you gave us in a form. This kind of information will always be anonymised.

We use a third-party provider, MailChimp, to deliver our newsletters. Through this, we gather anonymous statistics about email opening and clicks.

We use Google Analytics to collect basic log information and details of what visitors do on our website, as well as information provided by your computer, like your browser type. This data is anonymised and we will never attempt to find out the identities of those visiting our website.

#### Children/young people

Raindance is committed to the welfare needs of all children, young people and vulnerable adults who work with Coney, whether they are participating in Raindance workshops or are performers or makers on Raindance projects. We aim to create intimate, respectful and trusting relationships with everyone involved.

**Raindance is committed to a creative process which:**

• Places the welfare of children, young people and vulnerable adults first;  
• Respects the rights, wishes and feelings of young people, vulnerable adults and all with whom we are working  
• Promotes the welfare of all people we work with and their protection within a relationship of trust;  
• Ensures best health and safety practice. In our participation projects, we may collect data about the people taking part, including children & young people. We will seek consent from a parent or guardian before collecting data about children.

In order to deliver projects and keep participants safe, we may need information like medical details, school information, access requirements and notes and feedback on participants’ work with Raindance. This may be passed to emergency services if necessary. For people under 16 years old, Coney will use a nominated adult as the first point of communication, switching to the child on consent from that nominated adult or where needed to fulfil a contract.

#### How we keep your data safe, and who sees it

To protect your privacy, we make sure your data is kept securely and access is restricted to appropriately trained staff who need to use it for the processes outlined in this policy. We will keep and process your data only for long enough to fulfil the purpose we collected it for. After that point, we will dispose of in a secure manner.

We will never sell your data, but it may be processed by limited third parties in the course of achieving the purposes listed above. Third parties that may process your data for us include payment platforms, venues who need the names of bookers, ticket sites, and companies who store our data.

Some of our suppliers run their operations outside the European Economic Area (EEA). This means they may not be subject to same data protection laws as companies based in the UK, but we will take steps to make sure they provide a level of protection which meets the requirements of UK data protection law.  
We may share information about you with law enforcement agencies and other organisations or individuals if we are required to by law.

We want to make sure that the data we hold about you is accurate and up to date, and you can ask us to correct or remove information you think is inaccurate. You also have the right to ask us to ‘forget’ you, by erasing the data we hold about you as far as reasonably possible. If you would like us to do this, please get in touch on [info@raindance.co.uk](mailto:info@raindance.co.uk).

#### Opting out of marketing

We may communicate with you about ourselves, our events, ways to support us and other Raindance loveliness.

You have the right to tell us to stop contacting you for marketing purposes. If you want to opt out, just email [info@raindance.co.uk](mailto:info@raindance.co.uk) to let us know, or click ‘unsubscribe’ within the email we have sent you via MailChimp
