Scope of this Policy
RainFocus, Inc. (the “Company” or “We”) understands you care how information about you is
collected and used. RainFocus is committed to protecting the privacy of individuals who

practices related to RainFocus marketing, advertising, and company events.
RainFocus is an online event management platform with built-in predictive analytics and
comparison data management capabilities. We provide the RainFocus platform and related
support and other services to our customers. In this Privacy Policy, we will refer to the
RainFocus platform, RainFocus website(s), mobile and desktop applications provided by the
Company that you use at a physical event or that scan your badge onsite at a physical event,
and related services collectively as our "Services." We will refer to our emails, newsletters, and
other marketing and advertising practices collectively as our “Communications.” For the
purpose of this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information” means any information relating to an
identified or identifiable natural person.
This policy does not apply to information collected by any third party, including through any
application or content (including advertising) that may link to, or be accessible from or on our
website or mobile and desktop applications.
We provide Services to our clients. As part of the Services, client data may be stored on our

you control the data you collect, what data is uploaded to the Services, and how that data is
used. The collection, use, transfer, and retention of client data in our Services are governed by
our clients’ privacy policy, not this Privacy Policy. As a data processor, we will cooperate with
you in your efforts to control your data.
Information We Collect About You and How We Collect It​

browser or device may tell us your internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your

        than once.
        On certain pages of our websites, cookies are used to help us track your interests while
        you browse the internet, so we can tailor more relevant advertising to you, and to
        understand what is important to you.
How do I disable cookies?

        in your browser, you will not be able to fully experience some of our websites. For

suppliers. Should you require more information regarding our suppliers and how these cookies
operate please contact us at ​dataprivacy@rainfocus.com​.

        technology to access your personal information and it is only used to compile
        aggregated statistics about visitors who come to our websites to gauge the effectiveness
        of our ads.
