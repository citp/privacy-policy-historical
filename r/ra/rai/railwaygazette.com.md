2\. Web-bugs in "Premium Newsletters"  
So-called web-bugs (also referred to as “count-pixel” or “clear-gifs”) are embedded in certain of our Premium Newsletters to count the number of times the Newsletter is accessed in order to prevent misuse/breach of contract and to establish when the licence has been infringed.  
These relate to an invisible graphic, 1x1 pixel in size, linked to the user-ID of the relevant Newsletter subscriber in order to provide information on the number of times the user concerned accesses the contents of the Premium Newsletter. This tracking assists with correct billing for the services concerned.
