RAIDS.COM knows your privacy is very important. From time to time, we may change our privacy policy and thus we urge you to re-check this page on a constant basis to ensure that you know if and what these changes are. By continuing to use any part of the RAIDS.COM website after any changes to this policy have been made, you are agreeing to any and all changes made.

## Introduction

RAIDS.COM ("RAIDS.COM") considers your privacy to be of utmost importance.This privacy policy has been adapted from two policies: Google Adsense (Google Inc.) and Automattic (WordPress.com).This privacy policy is under the creative commons sharealike license. Please read and consider this notice very closely.

Website Users

RAIDS.COM, as most website operators do, collects non-personally-identifying information in a manner that web browsers and servers generally make available. This non-personally-identifying information pertains to, but is not limited to: what kind of browser, language preference, referring site, date and time of each visit (and visitor), demographics of every visitor, whether a visitor is new to the site or not, and operating system. We, RAIDS.COM, use this information we gather to better understand our audience, and thus improve the website through new and desired updates and changes. RAIDS.COM may publish information to the public regarding the usage of its website, such as in the form of reported trends of statistics of the website. However, RAIDS.COM will never release personally-identifying information such as your Internet Protocol address (IP Address). 

Again, RAIDS.COM does not use personally-identifying information of its visitors as described above, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

## Collection of Personally-Identifying Information

Many users of RAIDS.COM’ websites make the choice to interact with RAIDS.COM in ways that require RAIDS.COM to aggregate personally-identifying information. The amount or type of information that is necessary depends on the kind of interaction. One example is that we ask visitors who create an account with RAIDS.COM to provide an email address and unique username. In each and every situation, RAIDS.COM collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with RAIDS.COM. RAIDS.COM does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. Visitors are free to deny RAIDS.COM’ access to any personally-identifying information but must understand that it may hinder them from participating in specific website-related activities.

## Aggregated Statistics

RAIDS.COM may gather and examine statistics pertaining to the actions of visitors to its websites. As a couple examples, RAIDS.COM may monitor the most visited posts or the most commented on images. RAIDS.COM may publicly display this information on its websites or share it with others in various forms. RAIDS.COM does not disclose personally-identifying information other than described below.

## Protection of Specific Personally-Identifying Information

9GAG discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on RAIDS.COM’ behalf or to provide services available at RAIDS.COM’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. 

Some of the employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using RAIDS.COM’ websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.   
In some cases we may choose to buy or sell assets. In this type of transaction, user information is typically one of the business assets transferred. If RAIDS.COM, or all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that RAIDS.COM goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any new owner of RAIDS.COM may continue to use your personal and non-personal information only as set forth in this policy. Otherwise, RAIDS.COM will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.

Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, RAIDS.COM discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when RAIDS.COM believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of RAIDS.COM, third parties or the public at large. 

If you are a registered user of a RAIDS.COM website and have supplied your email address, RAIDS.COM may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or to simply keep you updated with company and/or website changes. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. RAIDS.COM takes all measures required to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

It is important to be aware that if you submit information to “message boards,” “forums,” or “chat rooms,” such information becomes public information, meaning that you lose any privacy rights you might have with regards to that information. Such disclosures may also increase your chances of receiving unwanted communications (also known as SPAM).
