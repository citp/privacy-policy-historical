In addition, the Rainforest Alliance may share de-identified, aggregate information on the performance of participants and the impact of the online training platforms with Rainforest Alliance affiliates and business partners.

**Individual Donors**. From time to time, we do make the street addresses of individuals who reside in the United States and who donate to the Rainforest Alliance available to other not-for-profit organizations whose missions we think might also be of interest to the individual.

**Third Parties that Provide Content, Advertising Services, or Functionality on Our Online Services**. Some of the content, advertising, and functionality on our Services may be provided by third parties that are not affiliated with us. Such third parties include:

  * Advertising providers, which help us and our advertising customers provide ads that are tailored to users' interests and understand how users respond to those ads; and
  * Audience-measurement companies, which help us measure the overall usage of our Services and compare that usage to other online services.



Some of these companies may participate in industry-developed programs designed to provide consumers with choices about whether to receive targeted ads.

### Final remarks

**Our Commitment to Security**

We shall provide appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data against loss or against any form of unlawful processing and shall impose such security obligations on any data processor we shall enlist. For example, we, or our data processor(s), shall use servers that have been placed in a controlled, secure environment, protected against unauthorized access.

**Children's Privacy**

Our Services are intended for a general audience. We do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose personal information from children under the age of 16 without prior parental consent, except as permitted by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.

That data is transferred under adequate data transfer mechanisms, including the Model Clauses, which were approved by the EC. You can request a copy of the data transfer mechanisms by contacting Dirk Straathof at dirk.straathof@utz.org or Molly Stark at mstark@ra.org.
