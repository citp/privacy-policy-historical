The purpose of this privacy policy is to disclose to you what information we may collect, how we may collect it, with whom we may share it, and certain other matters related to such information, including the choices you have regarding our collection of information and our use and disclosure to other parties of information we may have collected from you. 

**TYPES OF INFORMATION THAT MAY BE COLLECTED**

The following are the types of information we may collect:

**HOW INFORMATION MAY BE COLLECTED**

We may collect information from you in several different areas on the Site, including but not limited to those described below:

**Newsletters and Site Emails**  
We may offer free newsletters to share information with you about the Site, about us and our affiliates and subsidiaries, or about our business partners and advertisers and sponsors.

**Cookies**  
As with many Web sites, the Site uses standard technology called "cookies," which are small data files that are transferred to your computer when you allow your browser to accept cookies.

**IP Addresses and Click-stream Data**  
We may collect IP addresses and/or click-stream data for purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers and sponsors.

Click-stream data may include such information as the page served, the time, the source of the request, the type of browser making the request, the preceding page view and other such non-personal information. When analyzed, this data helps us analyze how visitors arrive at the Site, what type of content is most popular, what type of visitors in the aggregate are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising, and the like.

**WITH WHOM THE INFORMATION MAY BE SHARED**

At times, we may share your personally identifiable information with others for various purposes. The following outlines the ways in which your information may be shared with others: 

  * **Agents** : We employ other businesses, certain services and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, sending e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, Site analysis, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They may have access to personally identifiable information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. 

  * **Promotional Offers** : We may send offers to you on behalf of other partners. When we do this, we may give that partner your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, you may opt out in the email or change your preferences. 

  * **Aggregate Information** : We may share aggregate information such as demographics and Site usage statistics to advertisers, sponsors or other organizations. When this type of information is shared, the other parties do not have access to your personally identifiable information. 

  * **Opt-in and Opt-out Programs** : Throughout the Site you may be presented with opportunities to receive special offers from third parties. An opt-in/opt-out message will ask you if you would like your information to be shared. If you do choose to have your information shared, in an effort to protect you, third parties who have access to personally identifiable information must abide by the current Site privacy policy. However, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other companies, and you should review the privacy practices of such Web sites prior to providing your personally identifiable information. 

  * **Third-Party Ad Serving & Audience and Traffic Measurement Services**: The Site may use a third party network advertiser to serve the advertisements on the Site or may use a traffic measurement service to analyze the traffic on the Site. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to this Site and other Web sites you have visited. Third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to you for products or Web sites you might be interested in. Audience and Traffic Measurement Services allow us to collect anonymous traffic and behavior information from our Site by monitoring anonymous visitor activity. Although advertisers or other companies do not have access to the Site cookies, the Site's advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies on your computer if you choose to have your cookies enabled in your browser. Cookies allow third party advertisers to show you advertisements or content you might be interested in. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. 

  * **Raiders Partners Subsidiaries and Affiliates** : We may share your information (including, without limitation, personally identifiable information) with subsidiaries, affiliates, sponsors and/or advertisers of The Oakland Raiders. 

  * **Business Transfers** : The Site may be sold along with its assets, or other transactions may occur in which your personally identifiable information is one of the business assets transferred. In such a case, your personally identifiable information, which we have gathered, may be one of the business assets we transfer. 

  * **Legal Process** : In the event we are required to respond to subpoenas, court orders or other legal process your personally identifiable information may be disclosed pursuant to such subpoena, court order or legal process, which may be without notice to you. 




**CHAT ROOMS, FORUMS, AND MESSAGE BOARDS**

The Site may make chat rooms, forums and message boards available to its users. You are not required to provide any personal information when using these areas but you may choose to do so. If you post personal information online, it will be publicly available and you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties.

Also, we cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy. Please exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information in these areas. 

**LINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES**

You should be aware that when you are on the Site you could be directed to other sites beyond our control. For example, if you "click" on an advertisement, the "click" may take you off the Site onto a different Web site. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use the Site's logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other Web sites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit personal information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. If you visit a Website that is linked to our Site, you should consult that site's privacy policy before providing any personal information. 

**SECURITY**

This Site incorporates reasonable safeguards to protect the security, integrity, completeness, accuracy and privacy of the personal information that we may collect and we have put into place reasonable precautions to protect such information from loss, misuse and alteration.
