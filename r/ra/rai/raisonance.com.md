  * You have unambiguously given your consent; or 
  * The processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract; or

  * The processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject; or 
  * The processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller or in a third party to whom the data is disclosed; or 



All IoTize SAS entities ensure that these principles are observed. 

###  Why personal information is collected 

The primary reason for collecting information is to provide customers and other users with a service and a smooth, efficient and personalised experience while using our sites. For example, if you purchase products or request information on the sites, we use your personal information to fill your order or provide the requested information. IoTize SAS may collect personal Information from you to complete various transactions, such as: 

  * product or service orders 
  * product activations and registrations 
  * profile creation 
  * information requests 
  * support subscriptions 
  * contest entries or survey participation 
  * job applications 



###  What information is collected 

IoTize SAS collects and uses your personal information to better serve you and personalise your experience and interaction with our company. Such collection is done with appropriate notice and consent, along with required filings with data protection authorities, where applicable. 

Personal information (or personal data) means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity. 

This privacy statement does not cover personal information rendered anonymous or where pseudonyms are used. Data is rendered anonymous if individual persons are no longer identifiable or are identifiable only with a disproportionately large expense in time, cost, or effort. The use of pseudonyms involves the replacement of names or other identifiers with substitutes, so that identification of individual persons is either impossible or at least rendered considerably more difficult. If data rendered anonymous becomes no longer anonymous (i.e., individual persons are again identifiable), or if pseudonyms are used and the pseudonyms allow identification of individual persons, then this privacy statement will again apply. 

It is always up to you whether to disclose personal information to us, although if you elect not to do so, we reserve the right not to register you as a user or provide you with any products or services. 

The types of personal information we collect from you may include: 

  * your name, company, email address, phone number, billing address and shipping address 
  * customer type, job function, job title, purchasing authority, purchasing timeframe and others 
  * product and service preferences, contact preferences, educational and employment background, and job interest data 
  * your IoTize SAS user ID and password (where applicable) 
  * credit card information (where  applicable) 
  * IP address (see chapter on cookies)

  * Browsing and Searching: We collect certain personal Information when you visit the sites or click on the various links for products and services.
