Privacy Policy

Orders

We request information from the user on our order form. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date.) This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer’s orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services. 

Cookies 

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Our site uses cookies to keep track of your shopping cart. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. For example, the user will not be able to participate in any of our Sweepstakes, Contests, monthly Drawings that take place or order from the site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. 

Log Files

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

Links 

Our website has links to other organizations. You should be aware that: 

  * If you access another site through a link we provide, you are subject to the privacy policy of that site.
  * Reference in this referred website to commercial products, services, manufacturers, or companies does not constitute an endorsement by Rail Europe.
  * Rail Europe is not responsible for the contents to any linked sites. 



Newsletter 

If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and email address. 

Security

This website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. 

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer.) While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing’. 

  
All information you provide to RailEurope.com is transmitted using SSL encryption. The site employs SSL via a digital certificate issued by Verisign. You may view our certificate by clicking on the Verisign logo. 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage. 

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to [webmaster@raileurope.com](mailto:webmaster@raileurope.com). 

Correction/Updating Personal Information 

If a user’s personally identifiable information changes, or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user’s personal data provided to us. This may be done by emailing us at [info@raileurope.com](mailto:info@raileurope.com). 

Choice/Opt-out 

Our users are given the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information. Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line in the email or email us at [unsubscribe@raileurope.com](mailto:unsubscribe@raileurope.com).

You may also opt-out of any email communications through our website by going to: [http://www.raileurope.com/us/about_us/opt_out.htm](https://web.archive.org/web/20081015225847id_/http%3A//raileurope.com/us/about_us/opt_out.htm)

Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not. 

Notification of Changes

Any material changes in the way RailEurope.com uses personal information will be described in future versions of this Privacy Statement. Of course, you may always submit concerns regarding our Privacy Statement or our privacy practices to [webmaster@raileurope.com](mailto:webmaster@raileurope.com). Please reference the privacy policy in your subject line. Rail Europe will attempt to respond to all reasonable concerns or inquiries within five business days of receipt.
