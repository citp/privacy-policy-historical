Use of Cookies

The Rainbow Websites may use cookies to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Cookies are typically stored on your web browser and are used to help track clicks as you go through the pages within Rainbow's Websites.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Rainbow pages, or register with Rainbow's Websites or services, a cookie helps Rainbow to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Rainbow Website, the information provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Rainbow features that you customized.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. You can also set your browser to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you the opportunity to decide whether or not to accept it. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Rainbow services or Websites you visit.

Rainbow may combine the information it collects through cookies, with other information it has collected from you. This information may be used to improve its Websites, to personalize your online experience, to tailor its communications with you, to determine the effectiveness of its advertising, and for other internal business purposes. In addition, Rainbow may combine any financial account information that you provide for a purchase, with other personal information in order to complete a sale or transaction, or honor a return policy. By providing your financial account information along with personal information, you are hereby specifically opting-in and consenting to Rainbow combining this information.

How We Protect Your Personal Information

Rainbow believes in providing a safe and secure experience for all of its online Visitors. Accordingly, Rainbow has implemented security measures on its Websites to protect the information it has collected. By way of example, Rainbow links your personal information to select employees and others who have a real business need for this information. Rainbow has adopted appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices, and security measures to protect against unauthorized: access; use; and alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information, username, password, sale or transaction information, and data, stored on its Websites. To secure your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure, Rainbow uses data encryption technology when transferring and receiving your personal information. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, over a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) secured communication channel.

While we use the foregoing security measures to protect your information, please note that no data transmitted over the Internet, or stored and utilized for business purposes can be guaranteed to be completely secure. No security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot guarantee that only authorized persons will view your information. We cannot ensure that information you share on the Websites will not become publicly available. You can reduce these risks by using common sense security practices such as choosing a strong password, using different passwords for different services, and using up to date antivirus software.
