# Privacy Policy | Rainbow

We respect your privacy, and take great care to safeguard information in our possession. Your preferences for use of your information are our highest priority. 

The Rainbow family of companies (Rainbow, Rainbowshops.com, 5-7-9 and Marianne) takes seriously the protection and proper use of your personal information, including social security numbers. In this policy, we may use "we," "our," "us" and "Rainbow" to refer to the Rainbow family of companies. 

Rainbow does not share customer information (including email addresses) outside the Rainbow family of companies unless it is necessary to provide you with products or services available from Rainbow. We may also disclose information when you tell us to do so, to identify or contact you, to protect your rights or the rights of Rainbow or as required or permitted by law. 

Even within the Rainbow family of companies, we restrict access to your information to those individuals who need it to provide you with products or services available from Rainbow. Any third-party companies we use to provide you with products or services are required to keep your information secure and confidential. 

In this policy, "personal information" means any information by which you can be identified or contacted, such as your name (first and last), address (city, state, zip), email address, telephone number, etc.

We may combine all information we collect and we may disclose this information within our corporate family of companies or our service providers. When you visit our websites we may also gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or other device identifiers, browser information, Internet Service Provider (ISP), operating system, location, date/time stamp and clickstream data. 

**How We Use Your Information**

We use the personal information that we and our service providers collect to conduct our business and to provide you with the best possible products, services and experience. We may collect and use your information to provide you products and services, notify you of product recalls or safety issues, process and respond to your application for current or future career opportunities, process membership requests when you apply or otherwise administer your participation in our programs, to respond to your comments, questions or complaints, determine your satisfaction with our programs and service, to personalize your experiences, if you ask us to, send you marketing communications and other information you have chosen to receive regarding our products, services, marketing or special events. We also use your personal information for our everyday business purposes such as security, payment processing, analytics, operations, fraud detection and prevention, reporting, making back-ups and legal compliance. 

**How We Share Your Information**

To best serve you, we may share your personal information with other members of the Rainbow family of companies and with service providers that provide support services to us or that help us market our products and services, administer our programs, operations, fulfill your requests, surveys, contests, sweepstakes and product reviews, or provide you with membership information. Service providers, third parties who perform services on our behalf, are contractually restricted from using your information in any manner other than in helping us to provide you with the products and services available from Rainbow. We may also, in certain instances, disclose your personal information when we have reason to believe that it is necessary to identify you, contact you, to advise you of a product recall, detect and protect you or us from fraud or theft, manage information security or bring legal action to protect your rights or the rights of Rainbow or others. We may also disclose your personal information when you ask us to do so or when we believe it is required or permitted by law. 

**Video Recording**

We conduct video surveillance at our stores for security, fraud and loss prevention purposes and for incident reporting purposes. We use the images and information from such videos only as required for such purposes and for certain operational purposes, such as to measure traffic patterns in our stores.

**Text Messages**

If you agree to receive text messages from Rainbow we may use an automatic telephone dialing system to contact you. You are not required to consent to receive text messages in order to obtain product and services from Rainbow. Standard messaging rates apply. We may send you up to eight (8) messages per month. If you would like to stop receiving text messages at any time you can reply to any message with the word "STOP" or text the word "STOP" to short code 49899. We may send you one additional confirmatory message to let you know we received your request.

**Mobile Privacy**

Rainbow offers mobile applications (commonly known as "apps") that allow you to shop online, check product availability, learn about store events, or receive other information from Rainbow. All personal information collected by Rainbow via our mobile application is protected by this Privacy Policy.

Although you do not have to provide your location information to Rainbow to use our mobile applications, our store-specific services such as find-an-item require a zip code to function. You may manually enter a zip code and we will save your zip code(s) for future reference. Alternatively, when you download our mobile application, you may choose to allow it to obtain your precise location from your mobile device when you click the "near me" button. In this case, we will determine your zip code from the precise location data received from your mobile device. We do not store precise location data; we only store the zip code associated with the location. We may also update our mobile applications to offer automatic (or "push") notifications. We will provide push notifications only to those customers who opt-in to receive such notifications from Rainbow. If you have questions about location and notification privacy, please contact your mobile service provider or the manufacturer of your device to learn how to adjust your settings.

In the future, we may offer updated or enhanced versions of our mobile applications that include additional features created by us or using third party functionality. Our applications or the third party may automatically collect information about your precise location from your device, but only if you allow it.

**Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Similar Technologies**

Our website uses "cookie" and "web beacon" technology. We use cookies and web beacons to identify your device, provide website user authentication, conduct fraud prevention and management services, distinguish you from other visitors, record your IP address and understand your use of our site, and identify the name of the Web site from which you linked to Rainbow. This information is used for fulfilling contracts with our business partners, and to help us serve you better by improving our website design, as well as our products, services, and promotions. We do not otherwise track any information about your use of other websites. Information obtained through cookies and web beacons may be shared with or obtained by service providers on our behalf. More information is available under Third-Party Advertising Partners.

A cookie is a small data file that is placed on the hard drive of your computer when you visit a website. A "session cookie" expires immediately when you end your session (i.e., close your browser). A "persistent cookie" stores information on the hard drive so when you end your session and return to the same website at a later date, the cookie information is still available. A web beacon is a small string of code that represents a clear graphic image and is used in conjunction with a cookie.

When you visit our website, we may use both a session and a persistent cookie. This Rainbow placed cookie may contain information (such as a unique user ID) that is used to track your usage of our website and in some cases, your email address. Your email address is only saved in this Rainbow placed cookie if you register with us. A web beacon allows us to capture certain additional types of information about a visitor's actions on a web site, such as a visitor's cookie number, the time, date, duration and number of page views, a description of the page where the Web beacon is placed, and details about any items that were purchased. 

If you register with us, this Rainbow placed cookie allows us to recognize you when you return to our website and provides you with access to your account information. If you save your information with or order from us, we may also use cookies to monitor and maintain information about your use of our website. If you have not saved your information with or ordered from us, we may monitor and maintain information about your use of our website in a manner that does not identify you. You can disable cookies at any time by using your browser options; however, if you turn off cookies, we will not be able to track your order or enable you to make a purchase from our website. In addition, we will not be able to recognize you as a registered user to allow you access to your account information. 

We may use Flash Cookies (also known as Local Stored Objects) or other similar technologies. A Flash cookie is a small data file placed on a computer using Adobe Flash technology that may be built into your computer or downloaded by you to your computer. We use these technologies to personalize and enhance your online experience, facilitate processes, personalize and store your settings. Flash cookies may help our website visitors to, for example, set volume preference associated with a video experience, play games and perform surveys. They help us improve our sites by measuring which areas are of greatest interest to customers. We do not use Flash cookies for marketing or behavioral targeting purposes. Flash cookies are different from browser cookies and the cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. Learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies. If you disable Flash cookies or other similar technologies, please be aware that you may not have access to certain features and services that make your online experience more efficient and enjoyable.

**Third-Party Advertising Partners**

We use third-party service providers to serve advertisements (banners or links) on our behalf across the Internet. 

These advertising service providers may collect non-identifiable information about your visits to our website, and your interactions with our products and services. Such non-identifiable information does not include your name, address, email address or other personal information. The information is collected through the use of cookies and pixel tags (also known as action tags), which is industry-standard technology used by most major websites. 

In addition to the information about your visits to our website, our service providers may also use the information about your visits to other websites to target advertisements for products and services available from Rainbow. 

If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices for not having this information used by third-party service providers, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.

**Facebook Custom Audience Ads from Rainbow**

We may display interest-based ads to you when you are using Facebook through a tool offered by Facebook called the Custom Audience Tool. This tool allows us to personalize our ads based on your shopping experience with us. We do not share any of your personal information, including your shopping history, with Facebook. The tool lets Rainbow convert your email address to a unique number that Facebook uses to match to unique numbers Facebook generates from email addresses of its users.

**Social Media Interactions**

Rainbow invites you to socialize and share your fashion inspiration, finds and purchases with your friends using Social Media tools such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and Instagram. If you choose to use these tools, you may be sharing certain profile elements, including your comments. This sharing is subject to each social media program's privacy policies. We also use Facebook Social Plugins to allow Facebook to share information and friends' activities with its members while they are on our website. For example, Social Plugins allow Facebook to show you and your friends' "Likes" on our product pages if you are logged into Facebook while shopping at Rainbowshops.com. Rainbow does not receive or control any of the content from Facebook Social Plugins. To remove a Facebook "Like" through Rainbow, place your cursor in the "grayed out" Like button and click on the "X" that appears. This removes the "Like" from your Facebook Page, as well as from Rainbow's websites. You can also delete comments made while at Rainbowshops.com from your Facebook Page. 

For more information about Facebook Social Plugins and other social media tools, [click here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins). 

We may allow you to sign in to your Rainbowshops.com account using Facebook Connect. If you choose to do this, we may collect information necessary to facilitate social interactions such as friend lists, birthday, check-ins, basic profile information and your profile picture but only if the privacy settings you and your friends set within Facebook allow it. We will use the information we collect to create and facilitate an interactive social experience and to bring you products, services and programs from Rainbow. Rainbow will always comply both with its privacy policy as well as with Facebook Connect terms regarding use of Facebook profile information.

**Links to Other Websites and Services**

Websites provided by the Rainbow family of companies may include links to other Internet sites, content, or videos (embedded or direct links) maintained by third parties ('Linked Sites'). Rainbow provides Linked Sites to you solely as a convenience, and the inclusion of Linked Sites does not imply endorsement by Rainbow of the Linked Sites. You access Linked Sites at your own risk and by accessing them you leave Rainbow's website. Linked Sites are not under the control of Rainbow and Rainbow is not responsible for the contents of any Linked Site, including the privacy policies or tracking technologies they may use. We encourage you to check the applicable privacy policy to determine how they will handle any personally identifying information they collect from you.

**Children's Privacy**

Rainbow will never knowingly request or collect personal information from any person under 13 years of age without prior verifiable parental consent. If you are under 13 years old please do not provide your information on our website. 

If we become aware that an individual is under the age of 13 and has submitted any information to Rainbow for any purpose without prior verifiable parental consent, we will delete his or her information from our files.

**Security**

We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of personal information transmitted to us using this website. To help guard your information, our website uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). SSL encrypts your credit card number, name and address so only Rainbow is able to decode your information.

To be sure your connection is secure, look at the bottom status bar of your browser window. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser) the SSL is active and your information is secure. Most browsers offer additional security alerts as well. If for some reason you are unable to connect to our secure server, please call us toll free at 1-844-572-4626.

We also ask customers to carefully review their accounts and immediately report any unexpected activity to Rainbow and their issuing bank or credit card company.

  * Install the latest security updates and anti-virus software on your computer to help prevent malware and viruses
  * Reset your email account password
  * Use complex passwords (a minimum of 7 alpha/numeric cAsEsEnsitive characters)
  * Do not use the same password on more than one website
  * Do not share your password with others
  * Password protect your personal mobile device(s) 
  * Sign out/log off website sessions so that your session is closed and cannot be accessed by another user on the same computer, especially when using a public computer or terminal

**Business Transitions**

As we continue to develop our business, we may undergo a business transition such as acquiring another company, merging with an existing company, or selling a portion of our assets.
