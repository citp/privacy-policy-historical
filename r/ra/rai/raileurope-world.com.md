The protection of your privacy is an essential priority and we use your data to provide you with the products that you purchase on our sites. If this were not the case, it would be a pity that you couldn’t travel… :)

In this regard, here are the eight principles that Rail Europe and all of its employees implement:

● never collect or use data without a precise and legitimate purpose;  
● only collect data in one of the following contexts:   
— data necessary for the performance of contracts and for services that are requested,   
— express and specific consent from you,   
— duly-justified legitimate interest of the company;

● collect and use only data that is strictly necessary for processing;  
● keep data only for a limited duration that is coherent with the services provided;  
● constantly ensure the quality and security of data;   
● only make transfers of data when this is necessary and in accordance with legal and security rules;  
● constantly provide you with clear and transparent information;   
● ensure respect for your rights and the conditions for exercising them.

The present Privacy policy applies to all sites, mobile applications and services of Rail Europe.

The main data controller on the Rail Europe sites is the company Rail Europe (RCS Nanterre 401 714 993), located at 2 place de la Défense, CNIT 1, BP 440, 92053 Paris La Défense, France. Its legal representative is Mr Dâu-Khôi NGUYEN, as CEO (“Président”).




  


  * #### What is your data used for?

Rail Europe only collects and uses data concerning you for purposes that are precise and limited to what is necessary for you, namely:

● **processing your orders:**

— enabling carriers and travel partners to provide you with services ordered,   
— ensuring payment for the products that you have purchased,   
— providing assistance to users of Rail Europe sites by email, or chat, when they request assistance for an order, for connecting to the sites or accessing their customer accounts,   
— monitoring and providing after sales service for products ordered (information, cancellations, reimbursements, exchange, complaints),   
— helping making orders: if you do not complete an order made on the Rail Europe site, Rail Europe may send you an email offering its help;

● **managing your customer account:** at Rail Europe, the customer account is not mandatory. However, it is very useful because it is an account that is entirely dedicated to you and makes it easy for you to:

— easily give orders (automatic entry of your data: identification and travel preferences),   
— access your order data;

● **communicate with you:** for Rail Europe, maintaining contact with you is essential, but we only do it in a carefully controlled manner and we only send you electronic communications, via email, SMS or mobile notification, for the following reasons:

—  _monitoring orders:_ sending confirmations of orders and any other messages related to the service that you have ordered,   
—  _the management of your customer account:_ confirmation of creation or closure, modification of passwords,   
—  _making commercial offers:_ only in one of the following two cases:

□ if you are registered for the "Newsletter" service from Rail Europe,  
□ if you have ordered products on the Rail Europe site or the Rail Europe mobile application.

In all cases, you may unsubscribe from our commercial newsletter service by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of the newsletters,   
—  _rewarding of your loyalty:_ Rail Europe may occasionally present offers to reward your loyalty;

● **offering you personalised products and services:** at Rail Europe, we are intent on constantly offering you products that are most likely to be suitable for you. At Rail Europe, we offer you personalised content:

— in the commercial communications that we send to you,   
— when you browse the Rail Europe sites,   
— through certain services using geolocation (only on the Rail Europe mobile application),   
— via targeted and personalised advertising banners on other sites;

● **fighting fraud:** the security and proper functioning of our sites is a major issue. The data is analysed automatically by our subcontractor to determine a level of fraud risk associated with each order.  
The analysis criteria include the browsing behaviour, the data related to the terminal used and the bank details

According to the results of this risk analysis, and after a check by our anti-fraud teams, Rail Europe may do one of the following:

— validate your order;   
— request additional substantiating documentation;   
— refuse the order;   
— cancel the order and reimburse the funds.

In case of any confirmed problem with an order, or in the case of an outstanding debt, your data will be written to an alert file belonging to Rail Europe, which may, for future orders, make additional checks.

You can, at any time, make a complaint or request information by contacting Rail Europe customer service.

● **offer you games/contests:** in this context, Rail Europe and/or its partners will use the data that you have agreed to communicate strictly for the purposes of implementing the game and communication. As part of games and contests, after you have registered and given your advance authorisation, you may be offered commercial offerings from time to time by third-party partners of Rail Europe.
