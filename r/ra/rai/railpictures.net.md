Our users' privacy is a top priority at RailPictures.Net. Thus, we have developed this privacy statement, which outlines in detail the privacy policies of our site.

**Cookies.** Cookies are a small 'nugget' of information stored on a site users' computer. Cookies are used in conjunction with the RailPictures.Net database and discussion forums software to:

 \- remember specific user information (name, e-mail address)

  
 \- show number of new messages posted since a user's last visit   
 \- highlight messages posted since a user's last visit   
 \- remember user preferences.

No information is collected from users' computers through use of these cookies. If you do not wish to receive cookies from RailPictures.Net, disable cookies in your internet browser.

Cookies are used solely on the Photo Database and Discussion Forums sections of the website, and are not used in conjunction with any informational pages.

**Solicitation of e-mail addresses.** It is required that users who wish to include their photos in our database register for a free member account. At the time of registration, the user will be prompted for, among other things, his e-mail address. This information will be used solely to provide an avenue for database visitors to contact the user. The e-mail address will not be publicly displayed at any time, and all correspondence will be sent through a secure webform, protecting the user. All user e-mail addresses remain confidential.

**Automated collection of information.** For security purposes, the IP (internet protocol) address of each of our users is automatically recorded. In addition, when a user posts a message in the Discussion Forums, the IP address of the posting computer is recorded.

The collection of this information allows RailPictures.Net to pinpoint the origin of malicious activity, as well as to conduct geographical marketing research.

User IP addresses will never be distributed publicly, and are available only to RailPictures.Net personnel.
