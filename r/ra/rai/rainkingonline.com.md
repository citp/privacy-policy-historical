Such agreements require any such licensee to use such information only for such licensee’s internal business purposes, including sales, marketing or recruiting, and not to disclose such information to third parties. Such agreements prohibit such licensees from using any of the information in violation of any applicable law, which include laws regarding unsolicited marketing.
