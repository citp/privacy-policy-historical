##### Glossary

  * **Cookie**



> Message given to a browser program by a web server. The message is then stored by the browser in a text file _._ Each time the browser requests a page from the server, this message is sent back. A cookie's main objective is to identify users and personalise their visit by customising web pages for them for example by welcoming them by name next time they visit the same site. A site using cookies will usually invite you to provide personal information such as your name, e-mail address and interests. In our case, however, we do not use cookies at all.

  * **IP address**



> Every machine connecting to the Internet has a four-number address (e.g. 146.9.80.88) which may or may not stay constant between sessions online. Many web users connect indirectly to the Internet via an intermediary (proxy) server.

  * **Log files**



> Every time our web site is accessed an entry is made in the web server's log file. This tells us broadly where an access is coming from, when it was made, which file was requested and whether the request was successful or not. It usually does **not** allow us to identify individual users. The data is used to assess usage levels and spot technical problems (such as broken pages or web server errors).

  * **Web server**



> The machine which on which the RAF website is physically located, which delivers (serves up) web pages to your computer.
