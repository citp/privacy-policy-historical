<h2>RacingJunk.com Privacy Policy</h2>


<p><b><u>GENERAL STATEMENT</u></b>

</p><p>RacingJunk.com is a classified advertising service.  You do not need to be a registered RacingJunk.com member to view this web site.  However, there are some features that are only accessible if you are registered. This privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") discloses the privacy practices for Raceway Media, LLC ("Raceway").  Raceway is committed to your privacy.  Raceway hereby notifies you of:
</p><ol>
<li>	What personally identifiable information of yours, or third party personally identifiable information is collected from you through RacingJunk.com.
</li><li>	The company collecting the information.
</li><li>	How the information is used.
</li><li>	With whom the information may be shared.
</li><li>	What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information.
</li><li>	How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.
</li></ol>

<p><b><u>INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</u></b>

</p><p>Raceway is the sole owner of the information collected on RacingJunk.com.  Raceway will not sell, share, transfer or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.  Raceway collects information from its users on every classified ad page as well as on the "Members", "Post Ad", "Modify Ad", Honor Payments", "E-mail Newsletter", and "Forum" pages.

</p><p>If you would like to place an ad on RacingJunk.com, some of your personal contact information is shown with your ad, including your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, and any other information that you specify.

</p><p>There will be a link from your ad that users can click on in order to e-mail you if they are interested in your ad.

</p><p>Prior to the expiration of a listing, Raceway will e-mail a reminder to the seller that the listing must be updated, renewed or deleted.

</p><p>If you click on a classified ad, this will bring up a page that asks for your Classification Number, Password and e-mail address.  An e-mail can then be sent from you to the user who placed the ad.  Raceway does not use this information for any marketing purposes.

</p><p>If you "Save To Favorites" an ad, that ad will be stored on your behalf for future access.

</p><p>When you provide RacingJunk.com with a testimonial about your RacingJunk.com experience, we may ask for your name, e-mail address, phone number, and feedback regarding your experience.  We may use this information to contact you regarding your testimonial.  If you indicate that we may quote you, your name and experience may be shared with others or posted publicly to our site and you may be contacted about your experience.

</p><p><b><u>REGISTRATION</u></b>

</p><p>In order to use all the services of RacingJunk.com, a user must first complete the "Member Profile" registration form.  During registration, users are required to give information such as name, address, e-mail address, age, gender, online purchase habits and income.  Mailing address and e-mail address is primarily used to confirm the identity of the user.  This information is also used to contact the user about the services on RacingJunk.com for which he/she has expressed interest. Information as to the age, gender, purchasing habits, and income level and other unique identifiers (such as interests) are requested to help Raceway provide a more personalized experience on RacingJunk.com.

</p><p><b><u>OPT OUT PROCEDURES</u></b>

</p><p>You always may opt out of receiving future mailings or other information from Raceway.  To request that you not receive future communications, please send an e-mail <a href="mailto:optout@RacingJunk.com">to optout@RacingJunk.com</a> indicating the type of information that you no longer desire to receive.

</p><p><b><u>CHOICE/OPT IN</u></b>

<!-- <P>At the point where Raceway initially asks for personal information, Raceway users are given the opportunity to "opt in" before their information is used for purposes not directly related to Raceway.  For example, our "Member Profile" form has an "opt in" mechanism [Is this true?] so users who register with us, but don't want any marketing material, can keep their e-mail addresses off of certain lists. -->

</p><p>Users who no longer wish to receive the Raceway e-mail Newsletter or promotional materials from our partners may opt out of receiving these communications by updating their profiles on the "Member Profile" page of the web site.

</p><p><b><u>COOKIES</u></b>

</p><p>A cookie is data stored on the user's computer.  Use of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on RacingJunk.com.  Once the user closes his or her browser, the cookie simply terminates.  For instance, by setting a cookie on RacingJunk.com, the user would not have to log in a Password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site.  If a user rejects the cookie, he or she may still use our site.  The only drawback to this is that the user may be limited in some areas of the RacingJunk.com site. <!--  For example, [Examples of Limitations]. -->  Cookies can also enable Raceway to track the interests of RacingJunk.com users to enhance the experience of the RacingJunk.com site.

</p><p>Some of Raceway's business partners may use cookies on Raceway's site (for example, advertisers).  Usually, these cookies exist only if the user links on the ad.  Raceway has no access to or control over these cookies.  

</p><p><b><u>LOG FILES</u></b>

</p><p>Raceway may use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.



</p><p><b><u>SHARING</u></b>

Per Raceway's contractual arrangements with partners, these partners are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the explicit purpose of providing these services.
</li><li>	RacingJunk.com shall respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise its legal rights or defend against legal claims.

</p><p><b><u>LINKS</u></b>

</p><p>Raceway may contain links to other sites.  The linked sites are not necessarily under the control of Raceway.  Please be aware that Raceway is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.  Raceway encourages users to be aware when they leave RacingJunk.com and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.

Any links to any partner of RacingJunk.com should be the responsibility of the linking party, and Raceway shall not be responsible for notification of any change in name or location of any information of the site.

</p><p><b><u>CHILDREN'S AND MINOR'S PRIVACY</u></b>

</p><p>Raceway strongly encourages parents and guardians to supervise the online activities of their minor children and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers to help provide a child-friendly online environment.  These tools also can prevent minors from disclosing their name, address, and other personally identifiable information online without parental permission.  Although RacingJunk.com is not intended for use by minors, Raceway respects the privacy of minors who may use the Internet.  Whenever Raceway becomes aware that a user is under the age of 13 years, the following additional terms, conditions and notices apply to use of RacingJunk.com:

</p><ol>
<li>	Users under 13 years of age may not submit information through RacingJunk.com.

</li><li>	"Personally identifiable information" collected from minors may include any of the information disclosed in membership enrollment, including name, address, e-mail address, age, gender, income and other unique identifiers, and may be used by Raceway for the same purposes as adult information, as described in this Privacy Policy.
</li><li>	A minor's parent or legal guardian may request Raceway to provide a description of the personally identifiable information that Raceway has collected from the minor, as well as instruct Raceway to cease further use, maintenance and collection of personally identifiable information from the minor.

Raceway communicates via e-mail with users to provide requested services and to resolve issues relating to their accounts.

RacingJunk.com will endeavor to correct, update or remove the personal data provided by the user.

</p><p><b><u>NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES</u></b>

</p><p>If Raceway decides to change the RacingJunk.com Privacy Policy, Raceway will post those changes on the RacingJunk.com Homepage so users are always aware of what information Raceway collects, how Raceway we uses it, and under what circumstances, if any, Raceway discloses it.  If at any point Raceway decides to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, Raceway will notify users by way of an e-mail.  Users which have provided personally identifiable information before the changes in the RacingJunk.com Privacy Policy will have a choice as to whether or not Raceway may use their information in this different manner.  If the user chooses that Raceway not use his/her personally identifiable information in accordance with the new Privacy Policy, Raceway will use information in accordance with the Privacy Policy under which the information was originally collected.

</p><p>Raceway will notify you of any significant changes to the RacingJunk.com Privacy Policy by sending you an e-mail notice.

</p><p><b><u>RECOMMEND AD</u></b>

</p><p>If a user elects to use RacingJunk.com's referral service called "Recommend Ad" to tell a friend about the RacingJunk.com site, Raceway asks for the friend's name and e-mail address.  Raceway will automatically send the friend a one-time e-mail inviting the friend to visit the site.  Raceway stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time e-mail.  The friend may contact Raceway at info@RacingJunk.com to request the removal of this information from Raceway's database.
