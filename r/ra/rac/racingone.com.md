**Privacy Policy              
**  
**We are always conscious and respectful of your personal privacy.**  
This Privacy Policy governs the use of the MotorRacingNetwork.com (“MRN”) website (the “Site”).  The Privacy Policy’s purpose is to make you aware of our privacy policy and practices and the way information is collected and used with respect to the Site. To make this notice easy to find, a link to this Privacy Policy is on the homepage of the Site.  This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect at the Sites, but does not apply to information collected through other means. 

This Privacy Policy will answer your questions about the kind of information we collect and how we use it. If we change or update our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes here.  By using this Site, you acknowledge you have read this Privacy Policy and agree to the terms hereof. 

**What information do you gather and how do you use it?**  
MRN automatically collects certain non-personally identifiable information about your visits to the Site, such as IP address, service provider, browser type, operating system, pages accessed on the Site and the date and time of access to optimize your user experience and enhance your time spent with us online. Each owner also receives information telling us what site from which you originated.

When you send MRN an e-mail, MRN will retain the content of the e-mail, your e-mail address, and our response in order to handle any follow-up questions you may have. MRN also uses this information to measure how effectively MRN addresses your concerns.

When purchasing tickets or merchandise, joining as a member, registering for promotions at the Site, or in connection with gifts, ecards, e-vites, forward-to-a-friend messages or any other messaging service, MRN may ask for your or your friend’s: 

  * Name

  * Credit card number and expiration date 
  * Billing address 
  * Shipping address 
  * Date of Birth 
  * Phone number



We use the personally identifiable information you choose to provide to MRN to process the transactions and services you request, to provide MRN and MRN affiliates promotional communications to you, to enable you to participate in sweepstakes and promotions, and to otherwise facilitate your use of the Site.

MRN may ask you to voluntarily provide us with information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, experiences with us, and contact preferences.  This information may be combined with information about you, which MRN gathered from other offline sources. MRN and its affiliates use the information to design offers customized to your interests. For example, you may receive a special offer for your most frequently visited tracks. ****

**Information from other sources**  
MRN may receive information about you from other sources.  This may help improve the personalization of our service to you by providing better product recommendations or special offers that we think will interest you. ****

**Who do you share my personal information with?**  
MRN’s general policy is that MRN does not sell or share your name or other personally identifiable information to or with any non-affiliate third parties for marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such sharing.  However, MRN may share your name and personally identifiable information with its affiliate companies for such affiliates to send you promotional communications such as emails, phone calls and newsletters.  MRN may share anonymous, aggregated information (information that does not individually identify a user) about all our users with third parties for any lawful purpose. ****

**Service providers**  
MRN may also share information with companies that provide support services to us (such as a printer, mailing house or web host) or that help us market our products and services. These companies may need information about you in order to perform their functions. These companies are not authorized to use the information we share with them for any other purpose.

**Protection of the Site and others**  
MRN may disclose information you provide at the Site when we believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law; to enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property or safety of the Site, our users or other individuals. ****

**How does this Site use cookies and similar tracking technologies?**  
This Site uses cookies, tags, pixels and similar tracking technologies to allow MRN to recognize your preference information, keep track of your purchases, remember your Member Login and facilitate effective site administration. MRN uses the information we collect to enhance your visit to this site and provide you with information tailored to your needs.

You may elect to refuse cookies, but certain Site functions or access may not be available if you choose to do so. Please refer to your browser Help instructions to learn more about cookies.

A Web beacon is an electronic image, also called a single-pixel or clear GIF, placed in the code of a webpage or in e-mails.  The Site uses Web beacons to track traffic patterns of users as they navigate from one page to another.  This information lets us tune and improve our users’ browsing experience.  As with cookies, the information that Web beacons collect is aggregated, anonymous “click stream” data, and is not associated with you as an individual.

We also use Web beacons through a third party website analytics provider, as well as standard Web server log files, to help us count visitors and evaluate the Site's technical capacity.  This information tells us how many people visit the Site, and helps us decide how to arrange pages in the most user-friendly way.  This also helps us keep the Site browser-friendly and more useful to our users.  We record information on Site traffic, but not on individual visitors to the Site, so no personal information about you will be kept or used. **

How does this Site comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act?

** The Website is not intended for use by children under 13 years of age.  MRN does not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 13 years of age, except for the limited circumstances described below.  In the event a child under the age of 13 submits a question to us on the Site and identifies his or her age, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to limit our use of the child’s email address for the sole purpose of responding to the child’s question on a one-time-only basis.  However, we will not use the child’s email address to re-contact the child and we will delete it from our records once we have responded.  If we become aware that we have unknowingly collected personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to delete such information from our database. **

What choices do I have regarding

** **promotional communications?**  
MRN only sends promotional e-mail messages to you if you have voluntarily provided MRN with your e-mail address.

MRN reveals only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order.
