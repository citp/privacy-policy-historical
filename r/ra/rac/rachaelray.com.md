**California Privacy Rights**  
Under California law, California residents who have provided personal information to a company may have the right to request a list of all third parties to whom that company had disclosed such information for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year, along with a list of the categories of personal information that had been so disclosed. However, if a company adopts and discloses a privacy policy that provides the ability to opt-out of such disclosures to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes, then the company is not required to maintain and provide such lists, and instead may provide you with information on how to exercise your right to prevent disclosure of your personal information. Because the privacy policy as disclosed on this Site provides you with an opportunity to opt-out of disclosures by us of your Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes, we do not have to provide you with such lists. If you are a California resident who would like information on how to exercise your rights concerning third party disclosures, you may send an [email to this address](mailto:privacy@rachaelray.com). **Attn: California Privacy Rights Administrator Collection of Information**

**Collection and Use of Information**

We may also collect your Personal Information if you post, display and/or publish User Content on the Site. When users send us stories, recipes, photos and/or other User Content, these materials may be posted on our Site. We also may display a child’s photo or artwork, or photos that show images of any children, but we will only show a child’s first name and age. We will not show any last names or addresses, including email or postal. We will not use material without the acceptance by the user, or by the parent of a user if such user is under 18, of our User Content License Agreement. We will not return any materials, such as photographs, once they have been sent to us.  
Any information collected about you from the Site may be associated with other information that RRD has collected about you.

This aggregate tracking information is used to help RRD improve and enhance the website experience for all of its visitors.

We only collect, use and/or disclose your Personal Information with your consent. Your consent may be implied from the circumstances or may be expressly given for a particular purpose.

This information may also be used to help RRD and its commercial partners deliver targeted advertisements, promotions and other initiatives to you.

Opting in and opting out of electronic communications. At certain points where Personal Information is collected on our Site, there may be a box to indicate that you wish to receive certain information or communications from RRD. You may opt out of receiving electronic communications, such as emails from RRD at any time.

You may also opt-out or change your preferences by clicking on the “update subscription preferences” link at the bottom of our newsletters or by sending an email to contact@rachaelray.com.

Do Not Track Signals. Certain web browsers provide users with an option by which you may have your browser send a “Do Not Track” signal to the website that you are visiting, advising the recipient website that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. However, the way browsers communicate such “Do Not Track” signals is not yet uniform and accordingly, our Site does not take any action in response to such signals. In the event a final standard is developed and accepted, we may reassess how we should respond to such signals.

Use of Your Personal Information Within RRD. In order to provide you with efficient and reliable services and to improve product and service options available to you, RRD may share your Personal Information with our affiliated entities, in which case your personal information will be collected, used, disclosed, managed and stored in accordance with this policy as set forth herein. Our affiliates are companies controlled or owned by us, or companies that control us, or are under common control with us. The Site is intended for users in the United States and its territories and possessions, but if you use the Site from any country outside the United States, the various communications will necessarily result in the transfer of information across international boundaries, and by visiting the Site, you consent to these transfers as required or permitted by applicable law.

Use of Your Personal Information by Our Service Providers. From time to time, we may hire third parties to assist us with certain functions and services, such as data processing, computer software and website maintenance and development, transaction processing, promotional and marketing services, customer service, professional, legal or accounting services and/or business and sales analysis. RRD may share your Personal Information, without restriction (and regardless of whether you have chosen to limit our sharing of your Personal Information as collected on the Site), with such companies that we hire to perform services for us. In such situations, RRD requires that these companies agree to maintain the confidentiality of your Personal Information and to comply with the safeguards described in this Privacy Policy. These companies have access to the Personal Information needed to perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use such information for any other purposes. Furthermore, in compliance with privacy laws, we also provide our opt-out lists to non-affiliated third party companies so that communications sent by those companies on RRD’s behalf do not get sent to addresses appearing on our opt-out lists.

If RRD changes ownership. We may also share your Personal Information as required to allow for a change in ownership of RRD and/or any of RRD’s affiliated entities and/or of any business(es) to which the Site relates, and the related transfer of user information to the new owner. In the event of any such change of ownership, your Personal Information will continue to be protected by the terms of this Privacy Policy unless and until you are notified of a change.

Lawful access, legal action and investigations. Your Personal Information may be disclosed to non-affiliated third parties as either permitted by, or to comply with, applicable laws and regulations. Your Personal Information may be transmitted through and stored on servers outside your home country, and may be accessed by authorities in those jurisdictions. We may disclose Personal Information if we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected illegal activities or fraud, situations involving the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms and Conditions, or otherwise in accordance with applicable law. For example, RRD may disclose your Personal Information to comply with investigations by regulatory authorities or enforcement agencies in the United States of America or elsewhere, or to protect against or prevent actual or potential fraud. Furthermore, RRD may disclose your Personal Information if it has a reasonable good faith basis to believe that it is required to do so by law, compelled by court order or legal process, or is reasonably necessary and/or appropriate to: (i) protect the rights, property and/or safety of RRD or any other person or entity; or (ii) prevent or take action concerning any alleged: (a) illegal activity or (b) breach of the Terms and Conditions or Privacy Policy of the Site.

**Use of Cookies, Google Analytics  **

We may also use third-party advertising companies to target and show you advertisements when you visit the Site. On occasion, RRD permits third-party advertisers and ad networks to place their own cookies on our Site to track visitors’ activities on the Site. This enables such companies to recognize visitors so that when those visitors visit a third-party website, advertising can be delivered that is tailored to their individual interests (whether for RRD products or for the products or services of others), based on what has been learned from the visitors’ activity on RRD’s Site. This practice is called “interest-based advertising,” and the practices of these third-parties are not covered by this Privacy Policy.

RRD offers you choices about the collection of information on our Site. RRD adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising. If you decide you do not want to receive personalized ads from third-party advertisers and ad networks please visit [www.AboutAds.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choice), where you can learn more about opting out from receiving interest-based advertising.

If you want to delete any cookies that were already sent to your computer or personal device, please refer to your web browser’s “Help” facility. In addition, most web browsers can be set to prevent you from receiving new cookies, notify you before accepting cookies or disable cookies altogether. Details about this can normally be found in the “Help” facility provided with your browser. Please note that if you disable cookies you may not be able to take advantage of some of the Site’s interactive functionality.

The Site uses Google Analytics, a web analytics tools that helps website owners understand how visitors engage with their website.
