## Rack Lodge Privacy Statement

Rack Lodge takes privacy and data protection issues seriously. Rack Lodge’s Privacy Statement applies to basic contact information collected from customers who contract with **RACK LODGE** to use our services. As Rack Lodge’s services change, we may revise this statement. If you have questions about Rack Lodge’s privacy practices please contact us at: info@racklodge.com

## Information Collected

**RACK LODGE** collects information from its customers when signing an agreement. We only obtain information via our website when an individual or company requests a price quotation or has questions about **RACK LODGE** and its services. At that time, we will ask for contact information such as person’s name, phone number or e-mail address.

## Information Disclosure

Protecting customer information is an important part of our business.

## Information Security

Information security is critical to our business. We work to protect the security of a customer’s information through the use of security and encryption software. Any information that is gathered is stored on servers located in a secure data center. The number of authorized people with access to these servers is limited. Firewalls, SSL certificates (256 bits or higher) and other security technology are used to prevent system servers and computers from being accessed by unauthorized persons. It is the customer’s responsibility to protect against misuse of the customer’s Login Name and Password.

## System Access

**RACK LODGE** gives customers’ authorized personnel the ability to set system access and user permissions on an individual basis, including system view and administrative settings. All contents and materials are exclusive responsibility of the client, as well as the activities that they are dedicated to. Rack Lodge will not be held responsible for the content and materials hosted by the client.
