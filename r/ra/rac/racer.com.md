# Web site Privacy Policy - Racer.com

**PRIVACY POLICY**

Racer Media & Marketing, Inc. ("Racer") has created this privacy policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to protect your privacy and to fully disclose what information we collect and how we use it. Please note your use of our web site and mobile applications is also governed by the Terms and Conditions of Use.

**General Principles**

▪                In general, you may visit this web site or use the companion mobile applications (collectively referred to as the "Digital Offering") without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information.

▪                As you browse our Digital Offering, the Digital Offering collects log file, IP address of your computer, and other standard tracking data we use to evaluate Digital Offering traffic and usage patterns. Such information is aggregated with tracking data from all Digital Offering visitors. We will use the information to personalize the Digital Offering according to your preferences based on the aggregated information. We also use the aggregated information to evaluate products and services we may offer to you.

▪                Some portions of this Digital Offering may require you to give us personally identifiable information such as your name, job title, company, physical mailing address, e-mail address, telephone and fax numbers (Personal Information) and, if applicable, financial information such as your credit card information (Financial Information), for, without limitation, subscriptions to our publications and other products. If you communicate with us by e-mail, post messages to any of our chat groups, bulletin boards or forums, or otherwise complete online forms, surveys or contest entries, any information provided in such communications may be collected as Personal Information.

▪                If you elect to provide us Personal Information, we use it primarily to deliver the service you requested. Other uses of Personal Information are described elsewhere in this Policy.

▪                If you submit Financial Information, we use that information primarily to verify your credit and collect payments for your purchases, orders, registrations etc.

▪                Racer uses a third party to process credit card transactions and does not store financial information, such as credit card information on its website. We do retain the last four digits of the credit card number solely for customer service purposes.

▪                Racer uses Haymarket Media Inc. (“Haymarket”) to manage and deliver our Digital Offering so your Personal Information will be shared with Haymarket to the extent necessary to deliver the service requested.

**Information Sharing**

Unless you opt-out, we share your Personal Information with Racer's affiliates and partners and third parties licensed to access your Personal Information by any of the foregoing. To opt-out, send us an email to [Newlettersupport@haymarketmedia.com](mailto:Newlettersupport@haymarketmedia.com)

We may disclose your personal information to third parties:

▪                in the event that we offer to sell any assets in which case we may disclose your personal data to the potential purchaser of such assets;

▪                if substantially all of Racer's assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by us about you will be transferred to such third party;

▪                if we are required to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation or in order to enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions or any other agreement; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Racer, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for protection against credit risk and fraud.

▪                 

We do not disclose individual personal information to our advertisers, but we may provide them with aggregate information about our users. We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target. We would comply with our advertisers' wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience using the personal data we have collected from you and from others.

Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we will keep your Personal Information and your Financial Information private and will not share it with third parties, unless such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with a court order or other legal process; (b) protect our rights or property; or (c) enforce our terms of service.

Several companies unaffiliated with Racer or Haymarket provide email deployment services for our email messages. The personally identifiable information, such as e-mail address, we provide to these vendors for the purposes of e-mail deployment is only used by them for that purpose and not for any other business activity.

Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy. Inadvertent disclosures may result, for example, when third parties misrepresent their identities in asking the site for access to personally identifiable information about themselves for purposes of correcting possible factual errors in the data. 

In order to comply with the Federal CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, we also may provide lists of customers who have opted-out of email promotion for Racer products to other companies, so they can be suppressed from mailings those companies send on Racer's behalf. In addition, if you unsubscribe from a mailing we send to our own list on behalf of a third party, your removal instruction may also be supplied to the third party and added to their own suppression file. If you continue receiving email after opting out, please contact us at web@haymarketmedia.com.
