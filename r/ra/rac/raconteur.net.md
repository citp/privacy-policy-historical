We use cookies to distinguish users and improve our site. Please look at our Cookie Policy <https://www.raconteur.net/cookie-policy> for more cookie information.

 **5\. How we use what we collect**

We use information about you to:

• Present site content effectively to you.  
• Provide information, products and services that you request, or (with your consent) which we think may interest you.  
• Carry out our contracts with you.  
• Allow you to use our interactive services if you want to.  
• Tell you about other goods and services that might interest you. We will also let other people do this, and we (or they) may contact you.

If you are already our customer, we will only contact you electronically about things similar to what was previously sold to you.

If you are a new customer, you will only be contacted if you agree to it.

Please note: We don’t identify individuals to our advertisers, but we do give them aggregate information to help them reach their target audience, and we may use information we have collected to display advertisements to that audience.

In addition, if you don’t want us to use your personal data for any of the other reasons set out in this section in 5, you can let us know at any time by contacting us at contact@raconteur.net and we will delete your data from our systems. However, you acknowledge this will limit our ability to provide the best possible [products and] services to you.

In some cases, the collection of personal data may be a statutory or contractual requirement, and we will be limited in the [products and] services we can provide you if you don’t provide your personal data in these cases.

 **6\. Where we store your data**

We may transfer your collected data to storage outside the European Economic Area (EEA). It may be processed outside the EEA to fulfil your order and deal with payment.

By giving us your personal data, you agree to this arrangement. We will do what we reasonably can to keep your data secure.

Payment will be encrypted. If we give you a password, you must keep it confidential. Please don’t share it. Although we try to provide protection, we cannot guarantee complete security for your data, and you take the risk that any sending of that data turns out to be not secure despite our efforts.

We only keep your personal data for as long as we need to in order to use it as described above in section 5, and/or for as long as we have your permission to keep it. In any event, we will conduct an [annual] review to ascertain whether we need to keep your personal data. Your personal data will be deleted if we no longer need it.

• If we want to sell our business, or our company, we can disclose it to the potential buyer.

• We can disclose it if we have a legal obligation to do so, or in order to protect other people’s property, safety or rights.  
• We can exchange information with others to protect against fraud or credit risks.

We may contract with third parties to supply services to you on our behalf. These may include payment processing, search engine facilities, advertising and marketing.

Where any of your data is required for such a purpose, we will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your data will be handled safely, securely, and in accordance with your rights, our obligations, and the obligations of the third party under GDPR and the law.

12.7 If the parties fail to resolve the dispute(s) within 60 days (or such longer term as may be agreed between the parties) of the mediator being appointed, or if either party withdraws from the mediation procedure, then either party may exercise any right to seek a remedy through arbitration by an arbitrator to be appointed by LawBite under the Rules of the LawBite Arbitration Scheme.

12.8 Any dispute shall not affect the parties’ ongoing obligations under this Privacy Policy.
