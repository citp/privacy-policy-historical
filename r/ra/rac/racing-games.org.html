    <h1>Arcadelots.com Privacy Policy </h1>
  </div>
</div>
<div>
  <div align="justify"><br>
    This privacy policy covers how we  treat personal information that we collect and receive. We do not  intend to collect any personal information from children under 13  unless we believe such collection to be permitted by law. Please see  below for our policy with respect to children under 13. <br>
    <h1>General</h1>
    We gather user information to provide you with a customized experience  on our site. Your user information helps us tailor the content,  services, goods and advertising to your current and future needs. For  this reason, we may ask you to register or to provide personal  information when you post comments, enter a contest, order products,  subscribe to a newsletter and/or visit certain areas of our site. If  you choose not to register you may not have access to areas that  require personal identification. <br>
    <br>
    If you register with our site or purchase products from us, from time  to time we may e-mail you with messages about our services or third  party products and services we believe may be of interest to you, such  as new products, features, services, special offers and updated  information. The newsletters may contain code that enables our database  to track your usage of the newsletters, including whether the e-mail  was opened and/or what links (if any) were clicked. We will combine  that information with other information we have about you and may use  that information to improve your site experience and/or provide  customized e-mail communications to you. In addition, if you register  with our site or purchase products you may automatically receive  e-mails confirming your registration and/or purchase and providing you  with necessary information relating to the access or use of your  registration and/or purchase. With the exception of the e-mails  described in the preceding sentence which are necessary to provide  customer support and deliver products and services to you, you may  opt-out of receiving e-mail from us as described below. <br>
    <br>
    <h1>Use of Information</h1>
    When you register, we ask for your e-mail address, a unique nickname  selected by you and other information. Once you are a registered user  you can update your profile and may be able to provide additional  preferential information. <br>
    <br>
    For contests, we collect information from users in order to register  them for the contest and to provide for payment. We may use an order  form for users to request information, products and services. For that  order form, we collect a user's contact information (e-mail address)  and necessary financial information to process the order (i.e. credit  card number). Contact information from the order (including e-mail) may  be used to deliver digital products and information. We may use third  parties to accept and process orders and credit card purchases for  merchandise and products, including software. <br>
    <br>
    We may occasionally present a special contest or promotion that is  sponsored by another company. To qualify for entry in that contest or  promotion, we may ask you to provide personal information. If we plan  to share that information with the sponsor(s) or with others, we will  provide a statement to that effect in the contest or promotion terms. <br>
    <br>
    All communication on the Internet takes place between pairs of IP  Addresses. Our Web servers will log the IP address that any connection  is made from. We may use these IP addresses to help diagnose technical  problems or prevent abuse of our systems or other site users. Your IP  address may also be used to gather aggregate demographic data and  target advertisements accordingly. <br>
    <br>
    Your browser has options to accept, reject, or provide you with notice  when a cookie is sent. A "cookie" is a small line of text that is  stored with your Web browser for record-keeping purposes and to help us  provide better service to you. We use cookies to save your password (in  an encrypted format) on your machine so you don't have to re-enter it  each time you visit our site. We also use cookies to deliver content  specific to your interests and track your downloads and purchases from  our site. <br>
    <br>
    We use companies [Google (<a href="http://www.google.com">www.google.com</a>), Tribal Fusion (<a href="http://www.tribalfusion.com">www.tribalfusion.com</a>), Fastclick (<a href="http://www.fastclick.com">www.fastclick.com</a>), 24/7 Real Media (<a href="http://www.realmedia.com">www.realmedia.com</a>), RightMedia (<a href="http://www.rightmedia.com">www.rightmedia.com</a>), BudsInc (<a href="http://www.budsinc.com">www.budsinc.com</a>) ImpressionUp (<a href="http://www.impressionup.com">www.impressionup.com</a>) and AdBrite (<a href="http://www.AdBrite.com">www.AdBrite.com</a>)]  to serve the advertisements on some of our pages. These companies and  advertisers may place and access their cookies on your computer. Other  companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy  policies, not ours. We may use your information or allow advertisers or  companies that serve advertisements access to your information to  determine which advertisements you will see. This information may  include your demographic information, geographic location, what content  you access on our site, how you rate various content, language  contained in your comments and other information. <br>
    <br>
    Our site contains links, including banner and other ads, to other  Websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the  content of such Websites. Our site may also link to Websites that  feature our trademarks and names along with trademarks and names of  other companies. You should look at the privacy policy on that  co-branded Website, as the co-branded Website may not be under our  control. <br>
    <br>
    Applications you use or download from our site may contain third party  digital rights management systems ('DRMS') which may allow for  communication between your software and the third party and utilize  security features (e.g., preventing distribution of or access to the  applications in the event of unauthorized use). These DRMS are subject  to their own license agreements and you agree that we shall not be  responsible for any loss or damage of any sort relating to the use of  the DRMS or your dealings with such third parties. The applications may  also contain DRMS produced by us which allow for communication between  the applications you use or download and our systems and which collect  information describing your computer system in order to prevent illegal  or unauthorized use of the applications. <br>
    <br>
    For reasons such as improving member experience and providing  customized communications to our users, we may receive information  about you from third party sources and our web logs and add it to the  information that we have received from you. Web logs automatically  record anything a web server sees, which may include e-mail addresses  you enter into a form or pages viewed by a user at a particular IP  address. <br>
    <h1>Information Sharing</h1>
    We will not share your personally identifiable information with third  parties, aside from entities that perform services for us, such as  fulfilling orders or processing payment, that either are bound to  comply with our privacy policy or have privacy policies that protect  your information unless you have "opted-in" to such sharing. If you  have previously opted-in to such sharing under a prior privacy policy  version, you are still considered to have opted-in under this privacy  policy. As stated, and whether or not you have opted-in, we may use  third parties to accept and process orders for merchandise and  products, including software, and such third parties may get access to  your personal information for the purposes of providing services or  products to you on our behalf. In addition, if you opt-out, we may  share that information with third parties who send e-mails on our  behalf so that they do not e-mail you. <br>
    <br>
    However, we may disclose information you provide if required to do so  by law or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary  to (1) comply with the law or with legal process served on us; (2)  protect and defend our rights or property; or (3) act in an emergency  to protect someoneï¿½s safety. <br>
    <br>
    We may request demographic information from you (for example, your age,  education level or household income) from time to time. We will not  share that information in a manner that identifies you as an individual  with any other entity, unless we let you know that at the time of  collection or we have your permission. When we share demographic  information with third parties, we will give them aggregate information  only. <br>
    <br>
    In the event that we acquired by another company, your personal  information may be part of the assets transferred to the acquiring  party. <br>
    <h1>Opt-Out</h1>
    If you provide us with your e-mail address, and do not opt-out of  receiving e-mail from us, we may e-mail you with information, including  information about selected third parties. If you do not want to receive  information from us, you may decline to receive it (or "Opt-Out")  either when you provide personal information to us or you may update  your profile. You may also choose to Opt-Out from certain types of  e-mail by following the unsubscribe instructions that appear on each  newsletter. You may also contact us as provided below. Please note that  there might be a brief delay between when you submit your request to  opt-out and when it is processed and reflected in our systems;  accordingly you might continue to receive e-mails from us for a few  days after you unsubscribe. We maintain records of those users who  opt-out of specific e-mail options so that we do not e-mail them with  respect to those types of e-mails, and we may share this information  with third parties who send e-mails on our behalf so that they do not  e-mail you; this information may also be contained in web logs (see  above). <br>
    <h1>Children Under 13</h1>
    <p>Our site is not directed to children under the age of 13. We assume  products purchased through credit card means are purchased by adults.  We respect the privacy of parents and children and are committed to  complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). On  those areas of the sites that ask for age, we do not collect personal  information from individuals who identify themselves as under the age  of 13 except in those limited circumstances where we believe that such  collection is permitted under COPPA. </p>
    If a parent believes that his or her child has submitted personal  information to we, he or she can contact us via e-mail or postal mail  as listed below. We will promptly delete the information upon learning  that it relates to a child under the age of 13. Please note that it is  possible some of this information may remain archived in web logs and  back-up archives after we delete the information from its active  database (see above regarding web logs, and below regarding archived  information). <br>
    <br>
    We believe that parents should supervise their children's online  activities and consider using parental control tools available from  online services and software manufacturers that help provide a  kid-friendly online environment. These tools can also prevent children  from otherwise disclosing online their name, address and other personal  information without parental permission. <br>
    <br>
    <h1>Other</h1>
    We have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and  alteration of the information under our control. These include a  firewall to prevent unauthorized access to our systems and maintenance  of registration information in a separate database. Although we will  exercise reasonable care in providing secure transmission of  information between your computer and our servers, we cannot ensure or  warrant the security of any information transmitted to us over the  Internet and we accept no liability for any unintentional disclosure.  We will protect the transmission of credit card information through  industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption. <br>
    <br>
    We may offer chat, user reviews, multi-player games, bulletin board, or  other public functions and any posting by you is considered public  information available to other users. Any posting is governed by our  Terms of Use. You should take care to not use personal information in  your screen name or other information that might be publicly available  to other users. <br>
    <br>
    If a user elects to use our site for informing a friend about our site  or particular features or content, we ask them for the friend's name  and e-mail address. We will automatically send the friend a one-time  e-mail inviting them to visit our site. We store this information for  the sole purpose of sending this one-time e-mail. <br>
    <br>
    Your personal information is password-protected, and you should take  appropriate measures to protect the secrecy of your password. If you  use a computer in a public place or share a computer with others,  remember to sign out and close your browser window when you finish a  session with us in order to prevent others from accessing your personal  information. <br>
    <br>
    We maintain archives of our web logs, database, and other systems and  information. Please note that it is possible some of this information  may remain archived after we delete the information from its active  database (see above regarding web logs). We maintain archives for  disaster recovery, legal and other non-marketing purposes. <br>
    <br>
