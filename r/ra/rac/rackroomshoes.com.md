8.  **California Privacy Rights**  
Under California’s “Shine the Light” law, California residents who provide personal information in obtaining products or services for personal, family, or household use are entitled to request and obtain from us once a calendar year information about the customer information we shared, if any, with other businesses for their own direct marketing uses. If applicable, this information would include the categories of customer information and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we shared customer information for the immediately prior calendar year.

9.  **Children’s Policy**  
Rack Room Shoes is dedicated to protecting the privacy of all of its customers, especially children under the age of 13. Additionally, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that we inform parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use, and disclose personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. COPPA also requires that we obtain the consent of parents and guardians in order for children under the age of 13 to provide certain information to us.

The following is an explanation of our policies regarding collection of information from children under the age of 13. The term “child” or “children” below refers to such children under the age of 13 and the term “parent” below includes legal guardians. 

(a) **Collection of Information**. In connection with certain online sweepstakes and promotions only, Rack Room Shoes may knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. In such event, the information collected will be limited to the child’s name, age, address, e-mail address and the e-mail address of his or her parent. Pursuant to applicable laws, Rack Room Shoes will not condition a child's participation in any online activity on the child providing more personally identifiable information than is reasonably necessary. All information will be collected by the active submission of such information by the child, and not through the use of cookies or beacons. 

(b) **Use of the Information and Disclosure to Third Parties**. If a child registers for a sweepstakes or other promotion, we use the parent’s e-mail address to notify the parent of the child’s registration request (see below). All other personally identifiable information collected from the child will be used for the express purpose of operating the sweepstakes or promotion only, which may include notification to the child regarding rules and results of the sweepstakes and/or e-mail messages to the child regarding in-store or online promotions. In connection with such use only, we may share the child's personally identifiable information with our website hosting partners and certain third-party marketing services firms, as necessary. These parties have agreed to maintain the privacy and security of the personally identifiable information. In addition, we may share a child’s personally identifiable information with third parties to the extent reasonably necessary to: protect the security of integrity of our sites; to take precautions against liability; to respond to judicial process; or to the extent permitted under provisions of law, to provide information to law enforcement agencies or for an investigation related to public safety. Except for the limited disclosures described in this paragraph, we will not make any public disclosure (on our website or a chat page, for example) of any personally identifiable information provided to us by a child. As provided in the “How We Use Information” and “How We Share Information” sections above, we do not sell any personally identifiable information concerning our users. 

(c) **Parental Consent.** If Rack Room Shoes has actual knowledge that any child under the age of 13 has attempted to provide any personally identifiable information, we will send an e-mail to the parental e-mail address provided to us, and allow the parent to verify the child’s submission (and our subsequent collection and use for a stated purpose) of personally identifiable information. If the parent does not consent to allow the child's submission (and our subsequent collection and use for a stated purpose), we will promptly delete the child's information from our database. If for any reason, the e-mail sent to the parental e-mail address is undeliverable, we will delete the child’s submission as if the parent refused the child’s submission. In the event a child wins a sweepstakes or contest, and we want to publicize the name (and/or other personally identifiable information) of such child, we will again notify the parent at the parent's e-mail address and request that the parent provide his or her name and address for delivery of the applicable release and consent form. We will not publish or release the name or other personally identifiable information of any child as a winner of any contest without the express written consent of the child's parent. 

(d) **Review and Deletion of Information**. A parent can contact our customer service department at any time to review, change, or delete the personally identifiable information that we have collected from his or her child. A parent may also expressly request that a child's information not be shared with those limited third-parties with which we may share information, as necessary (and except as may be required pursuant to applicable laws), pursuant to (b) above. If you need any further information, or have any questions regarding our collection of personally identifiable information, please contact us at [customercare@rackroom.com](mailto:customercare@rackroom.co).
