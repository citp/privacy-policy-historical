<p>
This Privacy Policy covers Racing-reference.info's treatment of personal information that Racing-reference.info gathers when you are on the Racing-reference.info website and when you use Racing-reference.info services. This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that Racing-reference.info does not own or control, or to individuals that Racing-reference.info does not employ or manage.

Information Collected by Racing-reference.info
</p><p>
We only collect personal information that is relevant to the purpose of our website. This information allows us to provide you with a customized and efficient experience.

</p><p>
1. Information You Provide to Us: We receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features.

2. Automatic Information: 
</p><p>
We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. Racing-reference.info and its authorized agents automatically receive and record certain "traffic data" on their server logs from your browser including your IP address, Racing-reference.info cookie information, and the page you requested. Racing-reference.info uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its servers, analyze trends and administer the website.
Racing-reference.info may collect and, on any page, display the total counts that page has been viewed.
