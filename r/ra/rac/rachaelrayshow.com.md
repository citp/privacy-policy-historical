11\. Privacy Protections for Children

Most CBS Interactive Services are intended for a general audience and do not knowingly collect or store contact information about children under the age of 13. Some CBS Interactive Services may ask for your full date of birth date to ensure that they are not collecting information from children under 13 or to identify when additional steps may need to be taken when information has been collected from children under 18. In those instances where a CBS Interactive Service has actual knowledge that it collects information from children or offers a service directed toward children as defined under applicable laws, it will comply with those laws. To read about our privacy policy for children, please see the [Children's Privacy Policy](https://cbsi.secure.force.com/CBSi/articles/FAQ/mChildrens-Privacy-Policy?template=template_mobilepp&referer=mobilepp.com&data=&cfs=default).

Please remember that any information you disclose becomes public information and exercise caution when choosing to disclose your contact, financial, and other information in a submission. We cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this Privacy Policy, the law, or your personal privacy and safety. You should also be aware that we may also engage a third party to provide some of the services associated with the blogs, message boards and similar functions.
