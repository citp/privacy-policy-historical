CBS Interactive Inc. ("CBS Interactive") is committed to protecting your privacy. CBS Interactive, its affiliates, and its subsidiaries own, operate, or provide access to, several interactive web sites and other interactive features that provide an authorized link to this Privacy Policy (collectively "CBS Interactive Web Sites"). This Privacy Policy applies only to the [CBS Interactive Web Sites](http://www.cbsinteractive.com/our_brands.php).

This Privacy Policy describes, among other things, the types of information collected about you when you visit a CBS Interactive Web Site; how your information may be used and when it may be disclosed; how you can control the use and disclosure of your information; and how your information is protected.

• For any other purposes disclosed to you at the time we collect your information or pursuant to your consent.  
 

4\. Disclosure of Information

CBS Interactive is committed to maintaining your trust and we want you to understand when and with whom we may share information collected about you.

• __With your consent.__ With your consent, we may share your contact information with third-party business partners. For example, CBS Interactive Web Sites such as ZDNet.com and BNET.com offer free access to relevant services (e.g., webcasts and white papers) if you agree to have your information shared with third parties so they can contact you about related products and services.  
 

• __Authorized third-party service providers.__ We share your information with third-party vendors who help us with specialized services, including customer support, email and text message deployment, business analytics, marketing, and data processing. These third parties are allowed to use your information to help us provide our services and not for any other purpose.  
 

• __Sweepstakes, contests, or promotions.__ When you choose to enter a sweepstakes, contest, or other promotion, and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the promotions, your information may be disclosed to sponsors and third parties who help design, administer and implement the promotion, including in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment and aggregated data analysis. Your information also may be disclosed as required by law, such as on a winners list. Also, by entering a promotion, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that promotion, including allowing the sponsors to use your name, voice, and likeness in advertising and marketing associated with the promotion in accordance with applicable law. All terms applicable to the particular promotion will be made available to you at the time you enter the promotion.  
 

• __Co-Branded Partners.__ Co-Branded Partners are third parties with whom a CBS Interactive Web Site may jointly offer a service or feature. You can tell when you are accessing a service offered by a Co-Branded Partner because the Co-Branded Partner's name will be featured prominently. You may be asked to provide information about yourself to register for a service offered by a Co-Branded Partner. In doing so, you may be providing your information to both us and the Co-Branded Partner, or we may share your information with the Co-Branded Partner. Please note that the Co-Branded Partner's privacy policy may apply to its use of your information.  
 

• __CBS Interactive Web Sites and other CBS businesses.__ The CBS Interactive family continues to grow to include innovative [CBS Interactive Web Sites](http://www.cbsinteractive.com/our_brands.php) that offer rich and deep interactive experiences. Where permitted by law, we may share information we collect about you within the [family of CBS Interactive Web Sites and with CBS](http://www.cbscorporation.com/portfolio.php) Corporation, our parent company, and other CBS-affiliated companies, so we can provide you with information about products and services that might interest you.  
 

• __Business transfers.__ We may share your information in connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of a CBS Interactive Web Site, a merger, consolidation, asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.  
 

• __Legal requirements.__ We may disclose information about our users, including contact information, to respond to subpoenas, court orders, legal process, and other law enforcement measures, and to comply with other legal obligations, such as [FCC requirements](https://cbsi.secure.force.com/CBSi/articles/FAQ/mRadio-and-FCC-Requirements?template=template_mobilepp&referer=mobilepp.com&data=&cfs=default).  
 

• __Protect our Web Sites and users.__ We may disclose information to protect and defend the legal rights, interests, and safety of CBS Interactive Web Sites, other CBS companies, and their employees, agents, and contractors (including enforcing our agreements); to protect the safety and security of users of the Web Sites and members of the public; and as otherwise disclosed in our [Terms of Use](https://cbsi.secure.force.com/CBSi/articles/FAQ/CBSInteractive-Terms-of-Use?template=template_touzd&referer=touzd.com).  
 

Please note that we may share information with advertisers as described in our overview of [CBS Interactive online advertising](https://cbsi.secure.force.com/CBSi/articles/FAQ/mOnline-Advertising?template=template_mobilepp&referer=mobilepp.com&data=&cfs=default). We also may share aggregated or anonymized information with third parties, including to help us develop content and services we hope you will find of interest or to help these third parties develop their own products and service offerings. This sharing of anonymized or aggregated information will not include information that could be used to individually identify you.

11\. Privacy Protections for Children

Most CBS Interactive Web Sites are intended for a general audience and do not knowingly collect or store contact information about children under the age of 13. Some CBS Interactive Web Sites may ask for a birth date to ensure that they are not collecting information from children under 13 or to identify when additional steps may need to be taken in connection with information collected from children under 18. In those instances where a CBS Interactive Web Site has actual knowledge that it collects information from or offers a service directed toward children as defined under applicable laws, it will comply with those laws. To read about our privacy policy for children, please see the [Children's Privacy Policy](https://cbsi.secure.force.com/CBSi/articles/FAQ/mChildrens-Privacy-Policy?template=template_mobilepp&referer=mobilepp.com&data=&cfs=default).

12\. User-Generated Content

Some CBS Interactive Web Sites enable users to submit their own content for use in contests, blogs, on-air radio and TV broadcasts, online audio and video streams, videos, message boards, and other functions. Publication of User Generated Content on the CBS Interactive Web Sites is subject to our [Terms of Use](https://cbsi.secure.force.com/CBSi/articles/FAQ/CBSi-Terms-of-Use?template=template_tougl&referer=tougl.com&data=&cfs=default). Please remember that any information you disclose becomes public information and exercise caution when deciding to disclose your contact, financial, and other information in a submission. We cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this Privacy Policy, the law, or your personal privacy and safety. We may also engage a third party to provide some of the services associated with the blogs, message boards and similar functions. This third party will collect and host the information that you submit to the CBS Interactive Web Sites but will not use any of this information for purposes other than providing the service.

13\. Third Party Sites

When you select a link to a third party web site from one of the CBS Interactive Web Sites (for example, if you link to Pay Pal in order to pay for a product or service offered by a CBS Interactive Web Site), you will be leaving the CBS Interactive Site. Any information that you disclose on the third party site will be governed by that site's privacy policy.

If we modify our Privacy Policy, we will update the "Effective Date" and such changes will be effective upon posting.
