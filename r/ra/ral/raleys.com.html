	In this age of information, you value your privacy more than ever before, and so does Raley’s. You deserve to know how Raley’s treats your private information gathered on these websites. We encourage you to read these paragraphs so that you can learn more about Raley’s website privacy policy.</p>
<p>

<p>
	<em><br>
	Registration or enrollment<br>
	</em></p>
<p>
	<br>
	You can browse the websites without registering or enrolling, but you will need to complete a registration or enrollment form in order to take advantage of certain features, such as posting comments on a blog on our websites. By providing us with personal information that you offer voluntarily or that we solicit, you consent to our use of your information in accordance with our privacy policy and applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<p>
	<br>
	To use some of the features of our websites, you must first complete a registration or enrollment form and create a user name and password. During registration or enrollment, you are required to give contact information (such as name and address or email address). We may use this information to contact you about the services on our sites in which you have expressed interest and/or about products and special offers from our stores.</p>
<p>
	<br>
	After you submit a completed registration or enrollment form, you may receive a communication acknowledging our receipt of the registration or enrollment.<br>
	You can modify your registration or enrollment information anytime. Simply Sign In, click Manage Your Account and edit whatever information you wish.</p>
<p>
	<br>
	Do not share your password with anyone. Other than on the websites, we will never ask you for your password.</p>
<p>
	<br>
	<em>Orders</em></p>
<p>
	<br>
	If you purchase a product or service from us on-line, we request certain personally identifying information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number and expiration date). When you enter your credit card number on our order form, we encrypt it using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>
<p>
	<br>
	We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.</p>
<p>
	<br>
	After you submit a completed order form, you may receive a communication acknowledging our receipt of the order.</p>
<p>
	<em><br>
	Job Application Forms<br>
	</em></p>
<p>
	<br>
	If you apply for a job on our site, we require that you provide certain personally identifying information, including your name, address and phone number. This information is necessary to process your application and to contact you. When you enter your personal information on our job application form, we encrypt it using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>
<p>
	<br>
	After you submit a completed job application, you may receive a communication acknowledging our receipt of the application.</p>
<p>
	<em><br>
	Prescription Refills<br>
	</em></p>
<p>

	If you request a refill of your prescription on-line, we require that you provide certain personally identifying information, including your last name, birth date, and prescription number. This information is necessary to process your refill. This personally identifying information is subject to the terms and conditions of our pharmacy’s Privacy Notice, which is available on the Web-Fill web page, or you can link directly to it here.</p>
<p>
	<em><br>
	Surveys, Sweepstakes and Contests<br>
	</em></p>
<p>
	<br>
	From time to time, we may provide you the opportunity to participate in voluntary surveys, sweepstakes or contests on our site. If you participate, we may request certain personally identifying information from you. Participation in these surveys, sweepstakes or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. By providing us with personal information that you offer voluntarily or that we solicit, you consent to our use of your information in accordance with our privacy policy and applicable laws and regulations</p>
<p>
	<strong><br>
	Children<br>

<p>
	<br>
	We do not knowingly collect personal information from, nor are our websites intended for or directed to, children under the age of thirteen. In order to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, we ask parents to not allow their children under the age of thirteen to provide any personal information on this website. If children under the age of thirteen provide any personal information on our website, their parents or legal guardians should contact us at 800-925-9989 to have this information removed and to unsubscribe their children from any marketing communications from us.</p>
<p>
	<strong><br>
	Uses of Information<br>
	</strong></p>
<p>
	<br>
	We use the information we collect when you visit different sections of our websites to help make our sites, products and services more useful to you. For example, one section of our website may ask for a ZIP Code to help you identify store locations in the vicinity of that ZIP Code or to provide information to you about savings or special offers available in that vicinity.</p>
<p>

	If you are ordering products or services, your order information will be used and disclosed by Raley’s or its affiliated companies for billing and shipping purposes and to fill your orders.</p>
<p>

	If you are applying for a job, your application information will be used and disclosed by us, in connection with the application and hiring process. The application information can be used to assess your suitability for employment with Raley’s or its affiliated companies, conduct background investigations or verify information about you, conduct applicant and employment-related statistical evaluation and record keeping, and comply with legal obligations or respond to legal claims.</p>

<p>
	<strong><br>
	Information Sharing and Disclosure<br>

	<br>
	We share your personally identifying information with certain agents, representatives, contractors and service providers for limited purposes, including but not limited to, filling customer orders, offering certain products and services in connection with our websites, communicating with customers, providing customer service, enhancing and improving customers’ shopping experience, administering or facilitating surveys, sweepstakes or contests, offering targeted marketing communications to customers that opted-in to receive such communications, enabling access to our partners’ websites (e.g., LifePics, e-cart, Upromise, etc.), providing a personalized shopping experience, preventing fraud, and completing payment method processing. We may share aggregated demographic and statistical information with these partners. This aggregated demographic and statistical information that we share with these partners is not linked by us to any personally identifying information that can identify any individual person.</p>
<p>
	<em><br>
	Legal Disclaimer<br>
	</em></p>
<p>
	<br>
	We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifying information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, to prevent harm or injury, or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our website.</p>
<p>
	<em><br>
	Controlling Marketing Communications<br>
	</em></p>
<p>
	<br>
	We may from time to time send you email messages or other forms of marketing communications describing new items, featured merchandise and great values. You can choose to stop receiving any marketing emails from us at any time by following these steps:</p>
<p>
	<br>
	1. Sign in,<br>
	2. Click Manager Your Account, and<br>
	3. Select or deselect your preferences.</p>
<p>
	<br>
	Please allow up to 10 days for us to process your request. If you would prefer to stop receiving other forms of marketing communications from us, please follow the directions on the marketing materials or contact the Raley’s Service Center at 800-925-9989. Even when you elect not to receive marketing emails, you will continue to receive certain emails from us to: confirm any purchases you make on the websites, let you know your order has been shipped, share other information about your order, respond to your customer service inquiries, and answer any other questions you may have about our websites. In addition, we may also need to send operational emails to inform you of any changes to the websites that might affect your personally identifying information or your access to services. You will receive service and reminder emails if you register or enroll to use certain services offered by our stores, such as the Pharmacy AutoFill service.</p>
<p>
	<strong><br>
	Opt-out for Quality of Life Card<br>
	</strong></p>
<p>
	<br>
	On our Quality of Life Card webpage, we provide you the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having your personally identifying information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, if you do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from our Quality of Life Card program, you can indicate your preference on our Quality of Life Card webpage. We plan to discontinue the Quality of Life Card on January 1, 2013 because we plan to implement a new program in the fall of 2012, so please come back to our websites to learn about our new program in the fall.</p>
<p>
	<strong><br>
	Log Files<br>
	</strong></p>
<p>
	<br>
	As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in electronic log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.</p>
<p>
	<br>
	We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the sites, to track users’ movements around the sites and to enhance the experience of our customers on our websites.&nbsp; We do not link this automatically collected data to your personally identifying information.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Cookies and Other Computer Information<br>
	</strong></p>
<p>
	<br>
	A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. Visitors to our websites are sent anonymous cookies to keep track of their browsing patterns and build up a demographic profile.<br>
	We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our sites. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser.</p>
<p>
	<br>
	In addition, a user who has clicked on a Raley’s Family of Fine Stores advertisement on another website that links to raleys.com, nobhill.com, somethingextra.com or foodsource.net may be sent a persistent cookie that allows us to analyze advertising effectiveness and manage our relationship with the referring website. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.</p>
<p>
	<br>
	Persistent cookies are used to customize the content of certain sections of the websites and enable us to track and target the interests of our users and to enhance the experience on our websites. For example, we may set a persistent cookie to store your preferred store locations for weekly ads and promotions, so you don’t have to enter it more than once.</p>
<p>
	<br>
	If you reject cookies, you may still use our sites, but your ability to use some areas of our sites, such as weekly ads, will be limited.</p>
<p>
	<br>
	We also collect certain technical information from your computer each time you request a page during a visit to raleys.com, nobhill.com, somethingextra.com or foodsource.net. This information may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your computer's operating system, browser type and the address of a referring website, if any. We collect this information to enhance the quality of your experience during your visit to the website.</p>
<p>
	<br>
	We also contract with third parties to provide us with: data collection and reporting services regarding our customers' activities on the websites; tracking and measuring performance of our marketing efforts and your response to our marketing efforts; and the delivery of relevant marketing messages. These third parties may use cookies and Web beacons (1 x 1 pixels), and may receive anonymous information about your browsing and buying activity on the websites. None of your personally identifiable information (such as your name, address, email address, credit card number, etc.) will be received by or shared with these third parties. If you do not want your non-personal information used to serve ads to you, you should change the settings of your browser to reject cookies.</p>
<p>
	<strong><br>
	Links to Other Sites<br>
	</strong></p>
<p>
	<br>
	Our websites contain links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Raley’s and its affiliated companies. Please be aware that we, Raley’s and its affiliated companies, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites and the privacy polices of such other sites control any activity or transactions you conduct therein.</p>
<p>
	<br>
	We encourage you to be aware when you leave our sites and to read the privacy statements of each and every website you link to that collects personally identifying information. For example, you have left our websites when you click on the links to Kronos (employment applications), e-cart, Upromise, Healthnotes, our community calendar links and other similar links.</p>
<p>
	<br>
	This privacy statement applies only to information collected by us from the raleys.com, nobhill.com, somethingextra.com or foodsource.net websites.</p>
<p>
	<strong><br>
	Security<br>
	</strong></p>
<p>
	<br>
	The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter certain sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our order or job application forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). If your browser is capable of SSL, your personally identifying information will be automatically encrypted, or encoded, before it is sent over the Internet.</p>
<p>
	<br>
	Your personally identifying information is protected by the password you created when you completed the registration or enrollment form at our website or by another password you created after changing a previous password. Keep your password confidential. No representative of Raley’s will ever ask you for your password.</p>
<p>
	<br>
	We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. But no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<p>
	<br>
	If you have any questions about security on our website, you can send an email to us at webmaster@raleys.com.</p>
<p>
	<strong><br>
	Business Transitions<br>
	</strong></p>
<p>
	<br>
	In the event Raley’s or its affiliates go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifying information will likely be transferred.</p>
<p>
	<strong><br>
	Changes in this Privacy Statement<br>
	</strong></p>
<p>
	<br>
	If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement here and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>
<p>
	<br>
	We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here.</p>
<p>
	<strong><br>
	Contact Us<br>
	</strong></p>
<p>
	<br>
	If you have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us at webmaster@raleys.com.</p>
<p>
	<br>
	Effective Date: This privacy policy was last updated on August 15, 2012. Please check our privacy policy periodically for changes.<br>
