Relevant information also may be found in notices pertaining to specific data processing activities.

### Choice

Ralph Lauren generally offers Consumers the opportunity to choose whether their Personal Data may be (i) disclosed to third-party Controllers or (ii) used for a purpose that is materially different from the purposes for which the information was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the relevant Consumer. To the extent required by the Privacy Shield Principles, Ralph Lauren obtains opt-in consent for certain uses and disclosures of Sensitive Data.

Unless Ralph Lauren offers Consumers an appropriate choice, the company uses Personal Data only for purposes that are materially the same as those indicated in this Policy. 

Ralph Lauren shares Consumer Personal Data with its affiliates and subsidiaries. Ralph Lauren may disclose Consumer Personal Data without offering an opportunity to opt out, and may be required to disclose the Personal Data, (i) to third-party Processors the company has retained to perform services on its behalf and pursuant to its instructions, (ii) if it is required to do so by law or legal process, or (iii) in response to lawful requests from public authorities, including to meet national security, public interest or law enforcement requirements. Ralph Lauren also reserves the right to transfer Personal Data in the event of an audit or if the company sells or transfers all or a portion of its business or assets (including in the event of a merger, acquisition, joint venture, reorganization, dissolution or liquidation). 

### Accountability for Onward Transfer of Personal Data

This Policy and the privacy notices on the Sites describe Ralph Lauren's sharing of Consumer Personal Data. 

Except as permitted or required by applicable law, Ralph Lauren provides Consumers with an opportunity to opt out of sharing their Personal Data with third-party Controllers. Ralph Lauren requires third-party Controllers to whom it discloses Consumer Personal Data to contractually agree to (i) only process the Personal Data for limited and specified purposes consistent with the consent provided by the relevant Consumer, (ii) provide the same level of protection for Personal Data as is required by the Privacy Shield Principles, and (iii) notify Ralph Lauren and cease processing Personal Data (or take other reasonable and appropriate remedial steps) if the third-party Controller determines that it cannot meet its obligation to provide the same level of protection for Personal Data as is required by the Privacy Shield Principles. 

With respect to transfers of Consumer Personal Data to third-party Processors, Ralph Lauren (i) enters into a contract with each relevant Processor, (ii) transfers Personal Data to each such Processor only for limited and specified purposes, (iii) ascertains that the Processor is obligated to provide the Personal Data with at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Privacy Shield Principles, (iv) takes reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that the Processor effectively processes the Personal Data in a manner consistent with Ralph Lauren's obligations under the Privacy Shield Principles, (v) requires the Processor to notify Ralph Lauren if the Processor determines that it can no longer meet its obligation to provide the same level of protection as is required by the Privacy Shield Principles, (vi) upon notice, including under (v) above, takes reasonable and appropriate steps to stop and remediate unauthorized processing of the Personal Data by the Processor, and (vii) provides a summary or representative copy of the relevant privacy provisions of the Processor contract to the Department of Commerce, upon request. Ralph Lauren remains liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if the company's third-party Processor onward transfer recipients process relevant Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless Ralph Lauren proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

### Security

Ralph Lauren takes reasonable and appropriate measures to protect Consumer Personal Data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the Personal Data.

### Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation

Ralph Lauren limits the Consumer Personal Data it processes to that which is relevant for the purposes of the particular processing. Ralph Lauren does not process Consumer Personal Data in ways that are incompatible with the purposes for which the information was collected or subsequently authorized by the relevant Consumer. In addition, to the extent necessary for these purposes, Ralph Lauren takes reasonable steps to ensure that the Personal Data the company processes is (i) reliable for its intended use, and (ii) accurate, complete and current. In this regard, Ralph Lauren relies on its Consumers to update and correct the relevant Personal Data to the extent necessary for the purposes for which the information was collected or subsequently authorized. Consumers may contact Ralph Lauren as indicated below to request that Ralph Lauren update or correct relevant Personal Data. 

Subject to applicable law, Ralph Lauren retains Consumer Personal Data in a form that identifies or renders identifiable the relevant Consumer only for as long as it serves a purpose that is compatible with the purposes for which the Personal Data was collected or subsequently authorized by the Consumer.

### Access

Consumers generally have the right to access their Personal Data. Accordingly, where appropriate, Ralph Lauren provides Consumers with reasonable access to the Personal Data Ralph Lauren maintains about them. Ralph Lauren also provides a reasonable opportunity for those Consumers to correct, amend or delete the information where it is inaccurate or has been processed in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles, as appropriate. Ralph Lauren may limit or deny access to Personal Data where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the Consumer's privacy in the case in question, or where the rights of persons other than the Consumer would be violated. Consumers may request access to their Personal Data by contacting Ralph Lauren as indicated below. 

### Recourse, Enforcement and Liability

Ralph Lauren has mechanisms in place designed to help assure compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles. Ralph Lauren conducts an annual self-assessment of its Consumer Personal Data practices to verify that the attestations and assertions Ralph Lauren makes about its Privacy Shield privacy practices are true and that Ralph Lauren's privacy practices have been implemented as represented and in accordance with the Privacy Shield Principles.

Consumers may file a complaint concerning Ralph Lauren's processing of their Personal Data. Ralph Lauren will take steps to remedy issues arising out of its alleged failure to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles. Consumers may contact Ralph Lauren as specified below about complaints regarding Ralph Lauren's Consumer Personal Data practices. 

If a Consumer's complaint cannot be resolved through Ralph Lauren's internal processes, Ralph Lauren will cooperate with JAMS pursuant to the JAMS Privacy Shield Program, which is described on the JAMS website at [ https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield](http://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield/). JAMS mediation may be commenced as provided for in the JAMS rules. Following the dispute resolution process, the mediator or the Consumer may refer the matter to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which has Privacy Shield investigatory and enforcement powers over Ralph Lauren. Under certain circumstances, Consumers also may be able to invoke binding arbitration to address complaints about Ralph Lauren's compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles.

Customers located in Switzerland may direct us not to disclose their Personal Information to third parties (other than our service providers).

We may disclose Personal Information without offering individuals an opportunity to opt out (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process, (ii) to law enforcement authorities, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity. We also reserve the right to transfer Personal Information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use Personal Information you have provided to us in a manner that is consistent with our Privacy Notice. 

### Onward Transfer of Personal Information 

We may share Personal Information with service providers we have retained to perform services on our behalf.

Ralph Lauren provides Customers and Workers with reasonable access to the Personal Information maintained about them. We also provide a reasonable opportunity, as required by applicable law, to correct, amend or delete that information where it is inaccurate. We may limit or deny access to Personal Information where providing such access is unreasonably burdensome or expensive under the circumstances or as otherwise permitted by the Safe Harbor principles.
