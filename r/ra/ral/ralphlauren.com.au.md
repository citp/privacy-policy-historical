**Online Privacy Policy**

Your privacy on the Internet is important to us at Polo.com. Our online privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes the types of information we gather online and how we use it. Please read this information carefully. If the online information practices of Polo.com change, we will let you know by posting the Privacy Policy adjustments on our Web site. We will notify you by E-mail of any such material changes before we use your Personal Information in a manner not previously disclosed in our Privacy Policy. At that time we will remind you that you always have the opportunity to opt-out of any new use of your Personal Information (as more fully set forth below). This Privacy Policy does not cover our offline privacy practices, which are described in our Privacy Statement for Polo Ralph Lauren Stores. 

**Use of Information by Polo.com**

We gather certain types of customer information in an effort to improve your shopping experience and to communicate with you about our products, services, promotions and contests. Polo.com and its affiliates may also use this information to make offers to you, help us develop and improve Polo.com and tailor our site to your interests. 

**Information Collected by Polo.com**

Polo.com collects two types of information about users: “Personal Information” (such as name, e-mail address, mailing address and phone and credit card numbers) and “Aggregate Information” (such as information about how many users log on to our sites on a daily basis). 

**Personal Information Collected Online by Polo.com**

Personal Information is collected online when users voluntarily register with Polo.com to purchase items, receive electronic newsletters, use community and communication services, answer surveys and enter contests and other promotional opportunities provided on Polo.com. We also maintain a record of your product interests and purchases online. We may receive personal usage and demographic information from our affiliates and from third parties.

**Aggregate Information Collected Online by Polo.com**

Aggregate Information is non-personally identifiable/anonymous information about you, such as age, gender, types of products purchased, pages you access most frequently or search terms you enter. Aggregate information is used in a collective manner, and no single person can be identified by that compiled information. For example, the number of people who shopped at Polo.com who are 25 years of age is aggregate information that does not personally identify a specific user. Tracking Internet Protocol (IP) addresses is one method of collecting aggregate information about your activities online and information volunteered by you. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you surf the Web. The computers, which deliver the Web pages to you, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When you request a page from our site, our servers log your IP address. 

**Sharing Information Collected Online with Third Parties, Consultants and Affiliates**

Polo.com does not share, sell or trade with third parties your Personal Information gathered online, such as E-mail addresses, Personal Information collected as a part of an online survey or other specific details about you. We do not contribute to or participate in cooperative databases, which give other companies access to such Personal Information. For privacy purposes, all information relating to our customers is stored on a highly secure server, and all credit card information is stored in an encrypted format. 

Polo.com may share Personal Information gathered online with consultants and affiliates for any internal business purpose and may also divulge Personal Information if such information is required for Polo.com to comply with any valid legal process, such as a subpoena, search warrant, statute or court order, or if Polo.com believes that membership has been used to commit unlawful acts or acts that may endanger the health or safety of another user or of the general public. In addition, Polo.com receives personal usage and demographic information from its affiliates and from third parties and uses this information to improve our products and services. 

Polo.com may share Aggregate Information with affiliates and consultants for any internal business purpose and with third parties for their advertising and promotional purposes. 

**Use of Cookies**

A cookie is a small data file that Web sites, when you visit them, often store on your hard drive. A cookie may contain information (such as unique user ID), which is used to track the pages of the sites you've visited. Polo.com uses cookies to make your experience more enjoyable in a number of ways, such as enabling our "E-mail a friend" function once you have signed in, and preserving the contents of your shopping bag for up to 48 hours. Polo.com also uses cookies to measure activity on our site, which allows us to determine which areas and features of our site are most popular. This information allows us to make improvements and updates to enhance your Polo.com experience. Parts of our site, such as the members-only areas (for example, shopping, auction) will not function if you do not have cookies enabled. You can set your browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you turn off cookies or refuse them, though, you will not be able to make a purchase from our site, nor will we be able to recognize you as a registered user to allow you access to your account information.

**Notice to P3P Users**

The Platform for Privacy Preferences Project (“P3P”) is a standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (“W3C”) that provides an automated, machine-readable mechanism for understanding the use of your Personal Information by the websites you visit. P3P uses a standardized set of multiple choice questions covering the major elements of a web site’s privacy policy to provide a cross-section of how the particular website handles the personally identifiable information of its users. P3P-enabled browsers can automatically read this set of preferences made available by P3P-enabled websites and compare this information to the user’s own set of privacy preferences. For example, Internet Explorer 6.0 requires third parties to set cookies to deliver P3P “compact” cookie policies with their cookies, and other browsers may use this mechanism soon. To enhance your online experience further, the Polo website is now P3P enabled. For more information on the W3C and P3P, please visit <http://www.w3.org/P3P/>. Given certain limitations in the parameters chosen by W3C, however, the P3P mechanisms may not describe Polo.com’s privacy practices as accurately as this Privacy Policy. Accordingly, where discrepancies exist between this Privacy Policy and the P3P “compact” policies, this Privacy Policy shall control.

**Security and SSL**

Protecting your order information is a priority for us. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your online order information. To check the security of your connection, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), then SSL is active and the server is secure. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https." Some versions of browsers and some firewalls don't permit communication through secure servers. In that case, you won't be able to connect to the server and therefore won't be able to place an order through a secure connection. If you cannot access the secure server for any reason, please print our order form and place your order by phone at 888-475-7674. 

**E-Mail and Electronic Newsletters**

Polo.com and its affiliates may offer electronic newsletters and E-mails to those who have provided their E-mail address. You will only receive a newsletter or E-mail if you agree during registration or directly from our newsletter sign-up form to receive these items. Unsubscribe instructions are included in each electronic newsletter and E-mail. Please note that when you make a purchase from Polo.com we will send you an E-mail to confirm your order and may also need to contact you via phone, postal mail or E-mail if we have other questions regarding your order. 

**Information Removal**

If you prefer not to receive information from Polo.com, either by E-mail or postal mail please let us know by sending us an E-mail at [ unsubscribe@polo.com](mailto:unsubscribe@polo.com). Please be sure to include your full name, E-mail address, postal address and any message. Please note that such requests may take up to six to eight weeks to become effective.

Polo.com is concerned about the safety of children when they use the Internet., and understands that children may not understand all the provisions of our Privacy Policy or make informed decisions about the choices that are made available to adult users of the Polo.com website. We encourage parents and guardians to spend time with their children online and to be familiar with the sites their children visit.

We have no responsibility for those sites and provide these links solely for the convenience of our visitors. Such links may be to advertisers, content providers or other companies who may use our logo and/or style as a result of a co-branding agreement.
