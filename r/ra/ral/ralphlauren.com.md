_Information We Collect by Automated Means_

We obtain certain information by automated means when you visit our website, such as the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet and the pages accessed. By collecting this information, we learn how to best tailor our website to our visitors and understand what products and services you might prefer. We collect this information through various means, such as "cookies" and "web beacons." Both we and others (such as our service providers) may collect personal information about our visitors’ online activities over time and across third-party websites.

_Cookies_

Like many companies, we use "cookies" on this website. Cookies are bits of text that are placed on your computer's hard drive when you visit certain websites. Cookies may enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular site. We use cookies, for example, to preserve the contents of your virtual shopping bag between visits. We also use cookies to measure activity on the site and determine which areas and features of the site are the most popular. 

Most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie and how to disable existing cookies. Without cookies, however, you may not be able to take full advantage of all our site features. For example, if you turn off cookies or refuse them, you will not be able to make purchases on the site. 

Using cookies, we utilize Google AdWords remarketing service to show you our ads on other websites based on your prior visits to our website. You can opt out of this feature by clicking [here](http://www.google.com/ads/preferences).

We may use eBay Enterprise Targeted Display Advertising Services on this website. You can learn more about how this service functions by [clicking here](http://ebayenterprise.com/privacy/services_privacy.php), and you may opt out of eBay Enterprise targeted display services by [clicking here.](http://ebayenterprise.com/privacy/services_privacy.php%23optout) You also may opt out of eBay Enterprise targeted display services through the [Network Advertising Initiative website.](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp)

_Web Beacons_

Certain pages on this website contain "web beacons" (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags and clear GIFs). Web beacons are used for internal purposes, such as to obtain the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, and the type of browser used to view the page. We also retain service providers who use web beacons to assess the effectiveness of our email communications and learn what pages our visitors viewed. 

We may use third party web analytics services, such as those of Adobe Analytics and Google Analytics, to measure the effectiveness of our advertising and determine how visitors use this website. These service providers’ tools, including cookies and web beacons, allow us to collect information such as the state and zip code from which our visitors come and the IP addresses of our visitors' computers. To opt out of aggregation and analysis of data collected by Adobe Analytics and Google Analytics, please click [here](http://www.adobe.com/privacy/analytics.html) and [here](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). 

Our Stores 

Here are some of the ways we collect personal information in our Stores and a description of how we use the information: 

_Shopping_

When you buy products or obtain services in our Stores, we ask you for information we need to process your purchase or provide you with the services you requested. Depending on the payment method you use, and as permitted by applicable law, we may ask for information such as your name, mailing address, telephone number, driver's license or ID number, passport number, checking account information or payment card information. We also collect information about your purchase, such as the items you bought, the price of the items, the payment method you used and if the product was on sale. We use this information to process your transaction. 

_Customer Registry_

You may join our Customer Registry at our Stores. To join, we ask for your name, postal address, email address and mobile and home telephone numbers. You also may choose to provide us with your birth date and gender. We use this information to communicate with you about our products, services and promotions and for other marketing and customer service purposes. 

_Customer Satisfaction Surveys_

When you buy products or obtain services in our Stores, we may ask you to complete a customer satisfaction survey. If you choose to do so, you may provide information such as your name, email address, telephone number, age, gender and other demographic information, in addition to your comments. Providing any of this information is optional. We use the information you provide to improve our products and services, and enhance your shopping experience. 

_Ralph Lauren Credit Card_

At some of our Stores, you may obtain and complete an application for a Ralph Lauren credit card. Ralph Lauren credit cards are offered by a third party credit card issuer. If you choose to complete an application at one of our Stores, at your request, we will forward your application to the issuer or you may submit the application directly to the issuer by postal mail. Ralph Lauren does not maintain any information associated with your credit card application. The information you provide in connection with your credit card application is managed solely pursuant to the issuer's terms of use and privacy notice. We strongly recommend that you review these documents if you apply for a Ralph Lauren credit card. This Privacy Notice does not govern the collection or use of the information you provide in connection with your credit card application. 

Other Ways We Collect Personal Information 

_In-Store Wi-Fi Data Collection_

In certain stores we use a service that analyzes Wi-Fi signals from mobile devices to measure store occupancy and to identify customer traffic patterns in the store. The service determines the location of a smartphone or wireless device by observing Wi-Fi or Bluetooth signals that are broadcast from that device. Individual devices are identified by a media access control ("MAC") address that was assigned to the device when it was manufactured. For the service to collect information from your device, the device's Wi-Fi must be turned on while you are in the store. If your device's Wi-Fi function is enabled, you will receive a pop-up message that asks whether you agree to allow your device's Wi-Fi data to be collected while you are connected to the in-store Wi-Fi network. The service provider that collects information from mobile devices in our stores hashes MAC addresses to anonymize the addresses before using them for analysis purposes. The service provider's reports to us contain only aggregated statistics about visitors to the store. If you change your mind after agreeing to allow your device's Wi-Fi data to be collected, you can opt out by turning off your device's Wi-Fi function or by clicking [here](https://privacy.retailnext.net/). 

_QR Codes_

We use QR codes in connection with certain promotions, contests and special events. If you scan our QR code, you will get an invitation on your mobile device to join our mailing list. To sign up, we ask you for information such as your name, mailing address, email address, telephone numbers, and age. We use the information to communicate with you about our products, services and promotions. 

_Customer Assistance_

You may call our customer service line for information about our products or personal shopping advice. If you do so, we may ask you for information such as your name, email address, postal address, telephone number and, if you choose to make a purchase, your payment card information. We use this information to respond to your request and process your transaction. 

_Other Ways We Obtain and Use Information_

In addition to the ways we collect information about you described above, we also may obtain information about you from third parties. We may use your personal information to provide you with products or services you request (such as tailoring services or merchandise returns), enhance your shopping experience and communicate with you about our products, services and promotions. In addition, we may use your personal information for internal purposes, such as fraud and theft prevention, accident reporting, development and administration of our sites and Stores, data analytics, and compliance with our legal obligations, policies and procedures. 

We also may use information we obtain about you in other ways for which we provide specific notice at the time of collection.

_Department Stores_

Our products are available for sale in many department stores. Personal information collected in these department stores is not provided to Ralph Lauren. This Privacy Notice does not address the information practices of department stores in which our products are sold. Department stores may have their own privacy notices or policies, which we strongly suggest you review when you provide them with your personal information. We are not responsible for the department stores' personal information practices. 

   

Information We Share 

We do not sell or otherwise disclose personal information about our customers, except as described here. We may share the personal information you provide to us with our affiliates worldwide, licensees and joint venture partners for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice. We also may share the information with our service providers who perform services on our behalf based on our instructions. These service providers are not authorized by us to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. 

As described above, if you apply for a Ralph Lauren credit card at one of our Stores, we may provide the information on your application to the credit card issuer to fulfill your request. 

We also may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process (such as a court order), (ii) in response to a request by law enforcement authorities, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity. We also reserve the right to transfer personal information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use personal information you have provided to us in a manner that is consistent with our Privacy Notice. Following such a sale or transfer, you may contact the entity to which we transferred your personal information with any inquiries concerning the processing of that information. 

   

Links to Other Sites 

This website may contain links to other sites for your convenience and information. These sites may be operated by companies not affiliated with Ralph Lauren. Linked sites may have their own privacy policies, which we strongly suggest you review if you visit any linked websites. We are not responsible for the content of any websites that are not affiliated with Ralph Lauren, any use of those sites, or the privacy practices of those sites.

If you are using a web browser or firewall that does not permit communications through secure sites, you will not be able to make purchases on our site. 

We strive to protect the confidentiality and security of Social Security numbers ("SSNs") in our possession, custody or control by employing reasonable safeguards seeking to (i) restrict employee access to and use of SSNs; (ii) prevent unauthorized third party access to SSNs, and (iii) prohibit unlawful disclosure of SSNs. 

   

Transfer of Personal Information to Other Countries 

We may transfer the personal information we collect about you to countries other than the country in which you originally provided it. These countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you provided the information. When we transfer your information to other countries, we will protect that information as described in this Privacy Notice.

We notify our Customers and Workers located in the EEA and Switzerland about the purposes for which we collect and use Personal Information, the types of third parties to which we disclose the information (for example, service providers that process Personal Information on our behalf), certain privacy rights of our Customers and Workers (such as the right to access Personal Information and the choice for limiting the use and disclosure of the information), and how to contact us about our practices concerning Personal Information. 

Job applicants who submit Personal Information through our careers site may view our [ Careers Privacy Policy](http://global.ralphlauren.com/en-us/about/pages/careers.aspx?ab=footer_careers)for details about our Personal Information privacy practices. Current Workers can find additional information in the Employee Data Protection Policy available on Polo Express or from local Human Resources representatives.

**Purpose of Collection and Use of Personal Information**

We do not use Personal Information for purposes incompatible with the purposes for which we originally collected the information without notifying the relevant individuals of such uses and offering an opportunity to opt out. 

We may disclose Personal Information without offering individuals an opportunity to opt out (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process, (ii) to law enforcement authorities, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.

**Access to Personal Information**

Ralph Lauren provides Customers and Workers with reasonable access to the Personal Information maintained about them. We also provide a reasonable opportunity, as required by applicable law, to correct, amend or delete that information where it is inaccurate. We may limit or deny access to Personal Information where providing such access is unreasonably burdensome or expensive under the circumstances or as otherwise permitted by the Safe Harbor principles. To obtain access to Personal Information, Customers may contact Ralph Lauren as specified in the "How to Contact Us" section of this Policy. Workers should submit requests for access to their Personal Information to the local Human Resources representative.
