_Information Collected by Automated Means_

We obtain certain information by automated means when you visit our website, such as through cookies, web beacons, and web server logs. The information we collect in this manner includes the IP address of the device you use to connect to the internet, unique device identifier, browser characteristics, device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, information on actions taken on our site, dates and times of website visits, and the pages accessed. By collecting this information, we learn how to best tailor our website to our visitors and understand what products and services you might prefer. Both we and others (such as our service providers) may collect personal information about our visitors’ online activities over time and across third-party websites.

Like many companies, we use “cookies” on this website. Cookies are bits of text that are placed on your computer’s hard drive when you visit certain websites. Cookies may enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular site. We use cookies, for example, to preserve the contents of your virtual shopping bag between visits. We also use cookies to measure activity on the site and determine which areas and features of the site are the most popular.

Most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies. Without cookies, however, you may not be able to take full advantage of all our site features. For example, if you turn off cookies or refuse them, you will not be able to make purchases on the site.

Certain pages on this website contain “web beacons” (also known as internet tags, pixel tags, and clear GIFs). Web beacons are used for internal purposes, such as to obtain the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, and the type of browser used to view the page. We also retain service providers who use web beacons to assess the effectiveness of our email communications and learn what pages our visitors viewed.

We use information collected through these automated means for purposes such as (i) customizing our users’ visits to our website, (ii) delivering content tailored to our users’ interests and the manner in which our users browse our sites, and (iii) managing our sites and other aspects of our business. To the extent required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent before collecting information using cookies or similar automated means.

We also may use third-party web analytics services, such as those of Adobe Analytics and Google Analytics, to measure the effectiveness of our advertising and determine how visitors use this website. These service providers’ tools, including cookies and web beacons, allow us to collect information such as the state and ZIP code from which our visitors come and the IP addresses of our visitors’ computers. To opt out of aggregation and analysis of data collected by Adobe Analytics and Google Analytics, please click [here](http://www.adobe.com/privacy/marketing-cloud.html) and [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

_Interest-Based Advertising_

We may collect information about your online activities on our website to provide you with advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests. We also may obtain information for this purpose from third-party websites on which our ads are served. This section of our Privacy Notice provides details and explains how to exercise your choices.

You may see certain ads on other websites because we work with advertising partners (including advertising networks) to engage in remarketing and retargeting activities. Our advertising partners allow us to target our messaging to users through demographic, interest-based, and contextual means. These partners track your online activities over time and across websites by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of third-party cookies, web server logs, and web beacons. They use this information to show you advertisements that may be tailored to your individual interests. The information our advertising partners may collect includes data about your visits to websites that participate in the relevant advertising networks, such as the pages or advertisements you view and the actions you take on the websites. This data collection takes place both on our website and on third-party websites that participate in the ad networks. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. For example, we utilize Netmining’s targeted advertising services to show you our ads on other websites based on your prior visits to our site and other online activity. You can opt out of this feature by clicking [here](https://www.ignitionone.com/cookie-opt-out/).

You also may opt out of ad network interest-based advertising generally through the Network Advertising Initiative website or by visiting <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>.

**Our Stores**

Here are some of the ways we collect personal information in our Stores and a description of how we use the information:

_Shopping_

When you buy products or obtain services in our Stores, we ask you for information we need to process your purchase or provide you with the services you requested. Depending on the payment method you use, and as permitted by applicable law, we may ask for information such as your name, mailing address, telephone number, driver’s license or ID number, passport number, and checking account information or payment card information. We also collect information about your purchase, such as the items you bought, the price of the items, the payment method you used, and if the product was on sale. We use this information to process your transaction.

_Customer Registry_

You may join our Customer Registry at our Stores. To join, we ask for your name, postal address, email address, and mobile and home telephone numbers. You also may choose to provide us with your birth date and gender. We use this information to communicate with you about our products, services and promotions, and for other marketing and Customer Assistance purposes.

_Customer Satisfaction Surveys_

When you buy products or obtain services in our Stores, we may ask you to complete a customer satisfaction survey. If you choose to do so, you may provide information such as your name, email address, telephone number, age, gender, and other demographic information, in addition to your comments. Providing any of this information is optional. We use the information you provide to improve our products and services, and enhance your shopping experience.

_Ralph Lauren Credit Card_

At some of our Stores, you may obtain and complete an application for a Ralph Lauren credit card. Ralph Lauren credit cards are offered by a third-party credit card issuer. If you choose to complete an application at one of our Stores, at your request, we will forward your application to the issuer or you may submit the application directly to the issuer by postal mail. Ralph Lauren does not maintain any information associated with your credit card application. The information you provide in connection with your credit card application is managed solely pursuant to the issuer’s terms of use and privacy notice. We strongly recommend that you review these documents if you apply for a Ralph Lauren credit card. This Privacy Notice does not govern the collection or use of the information you provide in connection with your credit card application.

**Other Ways We Collect Personal Information**

_In-Store Wi-Fi Data Collection_

In certain Stores, we use a service that analyzes Wi-Fi signals from mobile devices to measure Store occupancy and to identify customer traffic patterns in the Store. The service determines the location of a smartphone or wireless device by observing Wi-Fi or Bluetooth signals that are broadcast from that device. Individual devices are identified by a media access control (“MAC”) address that was assigned to the device when it was manufactured. For the service to collect information from your device, the device’s Wi-Fi must be turned on while you are in the Store. If your device’s Wi-Fi function is enabled, you will receive a pop-up message that asks whether you agree to allow your device’s Wi-Fi data to be collected while you are connected to the in-Store Wi-Fi network. The service provider that collects information from mobile devices in our Stores hashes MAC addresses to anonymize the addresses before using them for analysis purposes. The service provider’s reports to us contain only aggregated statistics about visitors to the Store. If you change your mind after agreeing to allow your device’s Wi-Fi data to be collected, you can opt out by turning off your device’s Wi-Fi function or by clicking [here](https://privacy.retailnext.net/).

_QR Codes_

We use QR codes in connection with certain promotions, contests, and special events. If you scan our QR code, you will get an invitation on your mobile device to join our mailing list. To sign up, we ask you for information such as your name, mailing address, email address, telephone numbers, and age. We use the information to communicate with you about our products, services, and promotions.

_Customer Assistance_

You may call our Customer Assistance line for information about our products or personal shopping advice. If you do so, we may ask you for information such as your name, email address, postal address, telephone number, and, if you choose to make a purchase, your payment card information. We use this information to respond to your request and process your transaction.

_Ralph Lauren Restaurants and Bars_

When you make a reservation at a Ralph Lauren restaurant or bar, including RL Restaurant and The Polo Bar, we ask you to provide your name, telephone number, and email address. In connection with your reservation, you may choose to provide additional personal information such as food allergies and information about others. We use this information to communicate with you, to process your reservation, and to enhance your experience at our restaurants and bars.

When you visit a Ralph Lauren restaurant or bar, we may ask you to complete a form so that we can communicate with you about our products, services, promotions, and special events. If you choose to do so, you may provide information such as your name, telephone number, postal address, and email address. We use this information to process your request.

If you communicate with us through the “Contact Us” link on the RL Restaurant’s website, we ask you for personal information such as your name, telephone number, email address, ZIP code, and other information you may choose to provide. We use this information to communicate with you about your questions and comments. In addition, if you order a gift certificate for the RL Restaurant, we ask for your name, telephone number, shipping address, and payment card information. We use this information to process your order.

Reservations at our restaurants and bars may be made through third-party reservation platforms. We are not responsible for the content of any third-party platforms that are not affiliated with us, any use of these platforms, or the privacy practices of the operators of these platforms.

_Department Stores_

Our products are available for sale in many department Stores. Personal information collected in these department Stores is not provided to Ralph Lauren. This Privacy Notice does not address the information practices of department Stores in which our products are sold. Department Stores may have their own privacy notices or policies, which we strongly suggest you review when you provide them with your personal information. We are not responsible for the department stores’ personal information practices.

**Information We Share**

We do not sell or otherwise disclose personal information about our customers, except as described here. We may share the personal information you provide to us with our affiliates worldwide, licensees, and joint venture partners for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice. We also may share the information with our service providers who perform services on our behalf based on our instructions. These service providers are not authorized by us to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements.

As described above, if you apply for a Ralph Lauren credit card at one of our Stores, we may provide the information on your application to the credit card issuer to fulfill your request.

We also may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process (such as a court order), (ii) in response to a request by law enforcement authorities, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity. We also reserve the right to transfer personal information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use personal information you have provided to us in a manner that is consistent with our Privacy Notice. Following such a sale or transfer, you may contact the entity to which we transferred your personal information with any inquiries concerning the processing of that information.

**Links to Other Sites**

This website may contain links to other sites for your convenience and information. These sites may be operated by companies not affiliated with Ralph Lauren.

We strive to protect the confidentiality and security of Social Security numbers (“SSNs”) in our possession, custody, or control by employing reasonable safeguards seeking to (i) restrict employee access to and use of SSNs, (ii) prevent unauthorized third-party access to SSNs, and (iii) prohibit unlawful disclosure of SSNs.

**Transfer of Personal Information to Other Countries**

We may transfer the personal information we collect about you to recipients in countries other than the country in which you originally provided it. These countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you provided the information. When we transfer your information to recipients in other countries, we will protect that information as described in this Privacy Notice and will comply with applicable legal requirements providing adequate protection for the transfer of personal information to recipients in countries other than the one in which you provided the information.

Ralph Lauren does not process Consumer Personal Data in ways that are incompatible with the purposes for which the information was collected or subsequently authorized by the relevant Consumer. In addition, to the extent necessary for these purposes, Ralph Lauren takes reasonable steps to ensure that the Personal Data the company processes is (i) reliable for its intended use, and (ii) accurate, complete and current. In this regard, Ralph Lauren relies on its Consumers to update and correct the relevant Personal Data to the extent necessary for the purposes for which the information was collected or subsequently authorized. Consumers may contact Ralph Lauren as indicated below to request that Ralph Lauren update or correct relevant Personal Data.

Subject to applicable law, Ralph Lauren retains Consumer Personal Data in a form that identifies or renders identifiable the relevant Consumer only for as long as it serves a purpose that is compatible with the purposes for which the Personal Data was collected or subsequently authorized by the Consumer.

**Access**

Consumers generally have the right to access their Personal Data. Accordingly, where appropriate, Ralph Lauren provides Consumers with reasonable access to the Personal Data Ralph Lauren maintains about them. Ralph Lauren also provides a reasonable opportunity for those Consumers to correct, amend or delete the information where it is inaccurate or has been processed in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles, as appropriate. Ralph Lauren may limit or deny access to Personal Data where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the Consumer’ s privacy in the case in question, or where the rights of persons other than the Consumer would be violated. Consumers may request access to their Personal Data by contacting Ralph Lauren as indicated below.

**Recourse, Enforcement and Liability**

Ralph Lauren has mechanisms in place designed to help assure compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles. Ralph Lauren conducts an annual self-assessment of its Consumer Personal Data practices to verify that the attestations and assertions Ralph Lauren makes about its Privacy Shield privacy practices are true and that Ralph Lauren’s privacy practices have been implemented as represented and in accordance with the Privacy Shield Principles.

Consumers may file a complaint concerning Ralph Lauren’s processing of their Personal Data. Ralph Lauren will take steps to remedy issues arising out of its alleged failure to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles. Consumers may contact Ralph Lauren as specified below about complaints regarding Ralph Lauren’s Consumer Personal Data practices.

If a Consumer’ s complaint cannot be resolved through Ralph Lauren’s internal processes, Ralph Lauren will cooperate with JAMS pursuant to the JAMS Privacy Shield Program, which is described on the JAMS website at <https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield>. JAMS mediation may be commenced as provided for in the JAMS rules. Following the dispute resolution process, the mediator or the Consumer may refer the matter to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which has Privacy Shield investigatory and enforcement powers over Ralph Lauren. Under certain circumstances, Consumers also may be able to invoke binding arbitration to address complaints about Ralph Lauren’s compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles.
