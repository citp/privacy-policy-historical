_Information We Collect by Automated Means_

We obtain certain information by automated means when you visit our website, such as the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet and the pages accessed. By collecting this information, we learn how to best tailor our website to our visitors and understand what products and services you might prefer. We collect this information through various means, such as "cookies" and "web beacons." 

_Cookies_

Like many companies, we use "cookies" on this website. Cookies are bits of text that are placed on your computer's hard drive when you visit certain websites. Cookies may enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular site. We use cookies, for example, to preserve the contents of your virtual shopping bag between visits. We also use cookies to measure activity on the site and determine which areas and features of the site are the most popular. 

Most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie and how to disable existing cookies. Without cookies, however, you may not be able to take full advantage of all our site features. For example, if you turn off cookies or refuse them, you will not be able to make purchases on the site. 

_Web Beacons_

Certain pages on this website contain "web beacons" (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags and clear GIFs). Web beacons are used for internal purposes, such as to obtain the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, and the type of browser used to view the page. We also retain service providers who use web beacons to assess the effectiveness of our email communications and learn what pages our visitors viewed. 

We may use Omniture (www.omniture.com) to measure the effectiveness of our advertising and determine how visitors use this website. Omniture tools, including cookies and web beacons, allow us to collect information such as the state and zip code from which our visitors come and the IP addresses of our visitors' computers.

Polo Ralph Lauren does not maintain any information associated with your credit card application. The information you provide in connection with your credit card application is managed solely pursuant to the issuer's terms of use and privacy notice. We strongly recommend that you review these documents if you apply for a Polo Ralph Lauren credit card. This Privacy Notice does not govern the collection or use of the information you provide in connection with your credit card application. 

Other Ways We Collect Personal Information 

_QR Codes_

We use QR codes in connection with certain promotions, contests and special events. If you scan our QR code, you will get an invitation on your mobile device to join our mailing list.

We use this information to respond to your request and process your transaction. 

_Other Ways We Obtain and Use Information_

In addition to the ways we collect information about you described above, we also may obtain information about you from third parties. We may use your personal information to provide you with products or services you request (such as tailoring services or merchandise returns), enhance your shopping experience and communicate with you about our products, services and promotions. In addition, we may use your personal information for internal purposes, such as fraud and theft prevention, accident reporting, development and administration of our sites and Stores, data analytics, and compliance with our legal obligations, policies and procedures. 

_Department Stores_

Our products are available for sale in many department stores. Personal information collected in these department stores is not provided to Polo Ralph Lauren. This Privacy Notice does not address the information practices of department stores in which our products are sold. Department stores may have their own privacy notices or policies, which we strongly suggest you review when you provide them with your personal information. We are not responsible for the department stores' personal information practices. 

   

Information We Share 

We do not sell or otherwise disclose personal information about our customers, except as described here. We may share the personal information you provide to us with our affiliates worldwide, licensees and joint venture partners for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice.

As described above, if you apply for a Polo Ralph Lauren credit card at one of our Stores, we may provide the information on your application to the credit card issuer to fulfill your request. 

We also may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process (such as a court order), (ii) in response to a request by law enforcement authorities, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity. We also reserve the right to transfer personal information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use personal information you have provided to us in a manner that is consistent with our Privacy Notice. Following such a sale or transfer, you may contact the entity to which we transferred your personal information with any inquiries concerning the processing of that information. 

   

Links to Other Sites 

This website may contain links to other sites for your convenience and information. These sites may be operated by companies not affiliated with Polo Ralph Lauren. Linked sites may have their own privacy policies, which we strongly suggest you review if you visit any linked websites. We are not responsible for the content of any websites that are not affiliated with Polo Ralph Lauren, any use of those sites, or the privacy practices of those sites. 

   

How We Protect Personal Information 

We maintain appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect the personal information you provide on this website or in our Stores against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use and other unlawful forms of processing. We use Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") technology to protect the transmission over the Internet of your payment card data. You can check the security of your connection by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure site, the first characters of the site address change from "http" to "https." If you are using a web browser or firewall that does not permit communications through secure sites, you will not be able to make purchases on our site. 

We strive to protect the confidentiality and security of Social Security numbers ("SSNs") in our possession, custody or control by employing reasonable safeguards seeking to (i) restrict employee access to and use of SSNs; (ii) prevent unauthorized third party access to SSNs, and (iii) prohibit unlawful disclosure of SSNs. 

   

Transfer of Personal Information to Other Countries 

We may transfer the personal information we collect about you to countries other than the country in which you originally provided it. These countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you provided the information. When we transfer your information to other countries, we will protect that information as described in this Privacy Notice.

Subject to applicable law, we provide you with access to personal information we have retained about you and the ability to review, correct, update, block or delete the information where it is inaccurate.
