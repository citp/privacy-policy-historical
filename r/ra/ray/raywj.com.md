**PRIVACY POLICY (INCLUDING YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS)**

Last Updated April 13, 2011

At [RayWJ.com](http://raywj.com/), we appreciate your readership and respect your privacy. This is the official privacy policy and California privacy rights (referred to collectively herein as our **“Privacy Policy”).** Our Privacy Policy governs the Personal Information (as defined below) collected by this website, but does not cover any other information, whether collected in any other manner or for any other purpose, nor on any other website or service unless specifically stated.

**Overview** : Our Privacy Policy is intended to **explain our privacy practices** and inform you as to:

    **The kinds of Personal Information we collect from users and how such Personal Information is collected;**

    **How we use Personal Information;**

    **The circumstances under which we disclose Personal Information to third parties;**

    **How you can access, update or delete any Personal Information we collect about you; and**

    **The mechanisms we have implemented to protect your Personal Information.**

If for any reason, you do not agree with our Privacy Policy, please do not use any of this website at all because by doing so, you will have indicated that you have accepted same.

We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy at any time and from time-to-time by posting an updated version on this website, without advance notice to you, or we may, in our sole discretion, send you a message telling you we have made a change (for example, we may, email you about the changes). The changes shall be effective to you immediately upon our posting or when you receive our message, whichever is sooner. We encourage you to check our Privacy Policy often so you are aware of the most current terms and conditions that apply to you.

When we use the term **“Personal Information,” we mean information such as your first/middle initial or name and last name, street address, town or city, state, zip code, mobile device number, telephone number, profile, your photograph or audio-visual images of you, your instant-messenger nickname, blog, vlog or any personal website URL, your date of birth, email address, gender and any other information that would allow someone to identify or contact you. Personal Information also** includes information about your personal preferences, survey responses, and your transactions and interactions with us, if you are or have been a registered user or you have provided this type of information to us. Personal Information may also be contained in postings you post on this website or submit to us or any other user.  If you make purchases on our Site, in addition to your name and contact information, we will also collect and maintain your billing address, shipping address, service or product selections, your credit card or other payment instrument information, your order number, and information about your computer’s internet address and website which may have referred or directed you to our website ( _e.g._ , the referring URL).  Your credit card or debit card number is classified as “Sensitive Personal Information” and is collected via a secure transmission. ****

We are committed to protecting our users’ privacy and to keeping Personal Information you share with us through the use of our website secure, including Personal Information we obtain on our website and from your postings, but you understand, acknowledge and agree that we do not and cannot control your postings, nor are or shall we be liable if you post or make any information, about yourself or others, available (including allowing others to use your user ID or failing to protect your user ID from disclosure or use by others), on our website or otherwise. It is also important for us to explain to you how we collect, use, disclose and maintain your Personal Information and help you understand these things. We maintain reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your Personal Information and while no data transmission which is wireless or mobile or over the Internet is completely secure, we have used and will continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the protection of your Personal Information.

**YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS**

Residents of the State of California, under the California Civil Code, have the right to request from companies conducting business in California, a list of all third parties to which we have disclosed Personal Information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if we have a privacy policy that gives either an “opt-out” or “opt-in” choice for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as advertisers or affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, we may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options.

We qualify for the alternative option: we have a comprehensive privacy policy and provide you with details on how you may either decline to permit (“opt-out) or consent to (“opt-in”) the use of your Personal Information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Information for marketing purposes during the preceding year.

If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices, you must send a request to the following address with a preference on how our response to your request should be sent (email or postal mail). Send an email to the Privacy Administrator at [Privacy@RayWJ.com](mailto:Privacy@RayWJ.com) or you may contact us via postal mail at:
