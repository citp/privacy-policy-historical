You do not need to create an account in order to visit our site, however you will need to create an account to place an order through raymourflanigan.com.

For your privacy and security, we do not store credit card numbers in your account. You may change saved account information at anytime.</p>

<h2>Cookies and Other Computer Information</h2>
<p>When you visit raymourflanigan.com, small text files known as "cookies" will be stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies allow us to enhance and customize your online shopping experience and improve the design of our site. These cookies store random ID numbers and site navigation information such as your first and last visits, number of visits, shopping cart contents, and the pages you viewed on our website. We may also collect certain technical information from your computer. This technical information may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your computer's operating system, browser type and the address of a referring website, if any. The information stored in a cookie cannot be used to identify you personally unless combined with information that you have provided in connection with a purchase, setting up an account, or registering for promotional emails or surveys. Although IP addresses alone can reveal the location of your computer, we will use such information only to investigate and identify unauthorized activities.</p>

<p>Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you may configure your browser to not accept them.  If your cookies are disabled, you can browse on raymourflanigan.com but you will not be able to complete a purchase or take advantage of certain features of this site.  Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. If you would like to place an order on our site but have disabled or are unable to use cookies, please feel free to place your order via our toll free number 1.866.383.4484.</p>

<h2>How We Use Your Personal Information</h2>

	</ul>
<p></p>

<h2>When and With Whom We Share Your Personal Information</h2>
<p>We never <strong><u>sell or rent</u></strong> your personal information to any third parties under any circumstances.</p>

<p>We will share personal customer information only with our agents, representatives, service providers, and contractors for limited purposes, including fulfilling customer orders; offering certain products and services in connection with raymourflanigan.com; communicating to customers; providing customer service; enhancing and improving customers' shopping experience; enabling access to our partners' web sites; providing a personalized shopping experience; preventing fraud; and completing payment method processing.</p>

<p>Aside from the purposes described above, we will never share your personal information with any other third parties unless we have your express permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the disclosure is required to prevent harm or injury (such as product recalls, fraud, claims or other liability) or to comply with valid legal processes (subpoenas, warrants) or as required by law. We may share aggregated demographic and statistical information with our partners. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. </p>

<h2>How We Protect the Security of Your Personal Information</h2>
<p>Protecting the safety of your personal information is important to us.  We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology from Verisign to protect the security of your credit card and personal information as it is transmitted to us.</p>

<p>SSL is the gold standard in Internet encryption technology. It is a highly sophisticated method of scrambling data as it travels from your computer directly to our web servers.</p>

<p>To make sure you are accessing our secure server before you submit personal and financial information, look at the lower right-hand corner of your browser. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock icon (depending upon your browser), then SSL is active. To double-check for security, look at the URL or web address line of your browser. If you have accessed a secure server, the first characters of the address in that line should change from "http" to "https."</p>

<p>Some browser versions and some firewalls don't permit communication through secure servers like the ones we use to process orders at raymourflanigan.com. If for any reason you cannot access the secure server, please feel free to place your order with us by phone toll free at 1.866.383.4484. Our Customer Service representatives will be happy to assist you.</p>

<h2>Accessing and Updating Your Information</h2>
<p>You always have the opportunity to review and change the information you provide to us by logging into the site and entering in the new information yourself. You can edit your name, contact information and preferences by logging into the <a href="https://www.raymourflanigan.com/catalog/account_sign_in.asp" target="_parent" onclick="fullscreen('https://www.raymourflanigan.com/catalog/account_sign_in.asp'); return false;">Sign In</a> section of the site and then clicking on "Edit Your Account." </p>

<p>As a customer or subscriber you will occasionally receive e-mail communications about new Raymour &amp; Flanigan products, special offers we think you'll like and requests for feedback.  Raymour &amp; Flanigan is an opt-out organization.  You always have the ability to opt-in or opt-out of receiving future marketing communications from Raymour &amp; Flanigan.</p>

<p>To opt-out of or opt-in to receiving marketing communications from Raymour &amp; Flanigan, please take one of the following actions:
	</p><ol>
		<li>Follow the directions on a marketing e-mail or direct mail marketing communication from us. All marketing communications from Raymour &amp; Flanigan will tell you how to stop receiving them.</li>
		<li>Call toll free (1.866.383.4484) and provide your current contact information.</li>
		<li>Send an e-mail with your current contact information to: <a href="mailto: privacy@raymourflanigan.com">privacy@raymourflanigan.com</a></li>

	</ol>

This will ensure we identify you correctly in our systems and accurately process your request.<p></p>

	<p>Raymour &amp; Flanigan will take appropriate steps to implement your request to opt-out of or opt-in to receiving marketing communications. Please note that due to production, mailing and system timelines, in order to remove you from our marketing lists, it may take up to:
		</p><ol>
			<li>10 Business days for e-mails</li>
			<li>6 weeks for direct mail</li> 
		</ol>
	Until that change takes effect, you may still receive marketing communications from us.<p></p>
