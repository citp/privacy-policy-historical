What personal information do we collect?  
We collect personal information when you send us emails, submit queries to us, or subscribe to our autoFind service through our website. This is so that we can reply to your queries or requests for service.

Likewise, when you join our “autoFind” service we collect personal information such as your name, email address, and telephone number in addition to details of the types of properties you are interested in possibly purchasing or leasing.

Please note that if you want to remove yourself from our emailed “autoFind” service, simply “reply” to the next autoFind notification email you receive. Instructions are contained in each autoFind email notification.  
What other inforamtion do we collect?  
When browsing or searching our site, our server automatically collects navigational data to help us improve our website content and navigation. One way which navigational data is collected is by placing “cookies” in your browser file on your hard drive. Cookies do not capture or track any personal information and cannot identify you as an individual. If you wish, you may elect to not accept cookies on your browser. This should not adversely affect your experience when visiting the site. A cookie is a small amount of information that is transferred to your browser by a web server. The server that gives it to you can only read it again. It serves as a memory for you and can remember such details as your favourite search criteria so you do not have to enter the same information every time you come to the website.

How will information collected on this site be used?  
So that we can effectively assist your use of the site, we will use your personal information to provide our services and reply to your queries or requests for service.

Information about the kinds of properties you are interested in and inquire about may also be combined with other users’ information to generate statistics about the types of properties that people are searching for.  
Navigational data  
We may use your navigational information by combining it with the navigational information we collect about other users. Please note these results do not identify any individual, instead they give us aggregated results about the usage of the site. By doing this, we are able to improve the look and feel of our site, the content and navigation, and improve the services we provide to you.

Will personal information about me be given to anyone else?  
Where it is necessary for law enforcement purposes or where we believe there is a threat to a person’s safety or health, we may need to disclose your personal information to third parties as required by law.

Our site from time to time may contain links to other websites. Please note that these websites may have a different privacy policy to ours, and you should check their policy on those sites.  
How do we keep your information safe?  
We understand that security of personal information is paramount and we endeavour to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we hold in our servers is not subject to loss, misuse or unauthorised access or alteration. We also endeavour to take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify personal information if it is no longer required. Sometimes information can never be completely destroyed due to technical or accounting requirements, and also in some cases legal responsibilities that will require us to retain some information.
