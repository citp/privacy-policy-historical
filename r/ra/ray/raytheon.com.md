**1\. What Personal Information May Be Collected via the Site and Why?**

The Sites are operated on behalf of Raytheon Company located in the USA. At Raytheon, it is our policy to create Site content that demonstrates our respect for Visitors' privacy and allows us to understand our Visitors. We may request personal information from You as a Visitor, including Your name, home address, email address or telephone number, when You interact with the Site, such as to respond to Your requests or to enable You to register to use certain features of this Site or to be provided with certain services offered via the Sites. Raytheon may process such personal information in order to provide the Site and its services (including marketing services) to You, to monitor compliance with this Privacy Notice, any other terms and conditions applicable to Your usage of the Sites and with applicable laws, for security purposes and to set up access permissions to certain other pages on the Site.

**2\. Other Types of Information That May Be Collected via the Site and Why**

**2.1 IP Addresses**

An internet protocol address, or IP address, is automatically assigned to Your computer when You access the internet, and is used by web servers to identify Your computer. When You access our Site as a Visitor, we may log Your computer's IP address. We log the IP address for system administration purposes, for auditing the use of the Site, and for collecting statistical information for marketing and other purposes. Additionally, we may use Your IP address to identify a particular Visitor if we believe it is needed to enforce compliance with the terms of this Privacy Notice, any other terms and conditions applicable to Your usage of the Sites and with applicable laws or to protect our company, employees, Sites, or customers.

**2.2 Cookies or Tracers**

We may place information on Your computer to allow us to identify You. This information is known as a "cookie." We use cookies to view information about Your activities on our Sites, such as Your preferences or which pages You have visited on the Site, date and time of Your visit, Your referral page and the pages You visit after Your visit of our Sites, and Your browser settings. By understanding how and when our Visitors use the Sites, we can continually improve our Sites, as well as our products and services. Your browser may have controls that allow You to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent.

We use tracking scripts or "tracers" that recognize a unique identifier from a cookie placed on Your computer by another non-Raytheon website. These are used by Raytheon to gauge the success of our own advertising. For instance, we may use a tracer to determine whether You visit our recruiting pages after visiting a career site where Raytheon placed a banner advertisement. We do not use tracers to gather information on Your use of the internet unrelated to Raytheon, or to determine Your personal information.

Raytheon may use an advertising server developed by a third party to display ads on the Site. Some of these ads may contain cookies that are set by third parties (advertisers, sponsors). We do not have access to these cookies or any information that they contain. This Privacy Notice does not cover any use of information that a third-party ad server may have collected from You.

**2.3 Web Beacons**

Web beacons are small files that we may place on our Site, which count the number of unique Visitors that have visited a specific page on the Site and the number of times a given page has been displayed. This information is collected generally in the aggregate and is not linked to any personal information (except as described below).

**2.4 Pixel Tags**

We may use "pixel tags," or short pieces of code, to better measure the effectiveness of our content. These also allow social networks and other services to deliver content to You based on Your visit to our website.

**2.5 Custom URLs**

We may track Your visit by providing You with a unique universal resource locator, or URL, via an e-mail, a letter or other communication. When You use this unique URL, our website registers Your visit. We use this information to measure the effectiveness of our advertising and other content with You.

**2.6 Do-Not-Track**

Our information collection practices operate as described in this Privacy Notice independent of any "do-not-track" choice You make.

Raytheon transfers, discloses or shares Your personal information with its affiliates as necessary for the purposes stated therein. 

Generally, Your personal information will not be shared with third parties not affiliated with Raytheon. From time to time we may transfer, disclose or share Your personal information with third parties that Raytheon has engaged specifically to handle and deliver certain online activities or other support services, including, but not limited to, conducting contests and sweepstakes, hosting or marketing services. Such third parties will receive Your personal information needed to perform these functions, but we do not allow them to use it for other purposes without Your consent. When You provide Your personal information to Raytheon in response to a contest, sweepstake, or other project consistent with our [Terms and Conditions](https://www.raytheon.com/legal/), You may thereby consent that we publicly disclose and use Your personal information, as permitted by applicable law. 

Raytheon transfers business partner personal information for the purposes described in Section 1 moreover to the following types of third parties: ethics investigations providers, financial transaction messaging providers, legal advisors, document management systems providers, screening and escalation services providers, and network and IT support providers. Raytheon transfers customer personal information for the purposes described in Section 1 moreover to the following types of third parties: financial transaction messaging providers, and legal advisors.

Raytheon may also disclose Your personal information to courts, governmental and law enforcement authorities, legal counsel and similar third parties (1) where such disclosure is required or permitted by law; (2) to protect Raytheon's legal rights to the extent authorized or permitted by law; or (3) in an emergency where the health or safety of You or another individual may be endangered.

**5\. Security of Personal Information Collected**

We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the personal information You provide against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use.  While Raytheon makes extensive effort to prevent unauthorized access to personal information, the security of information transmitted via the internet cannot be guaranteed. Any information disclosed online can potentially be collected and used by others aside from the intended recipient. Thus, Raytheon cannot warrant that Your personal information will not be disclosed to or accessed by unauthorized parties.

**6\. Your Privacy Choices/Updates to Your Information**

**7\. External Links**

**7.1** The Site may provide links to other independently owned, controlled, and/or managed websites whose content we believe will be of possible interest and value to our Visitors. In many cases, these links represent cooperative projects or mutual links established with the organizations connected with these websites. We don't control the content of the third party websites accessed by You via these links on our Sites. These third party websites may send You their own cookies, collect data, or solicit personal information. Once You leave our Site (You can generally tell on which Site You are by checking the URL in the location bar on Your browser), the provision and use of any information You provide is governed by the privacy statement of the operator of the website You are visiting. That privacy statement may differ from ours.

**_Country, State and Regional Specific Data Privacy Information_**

**8\. Children's Privacy (COPPA) in the US**

We have implemented additional privacy safeguards when we collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. 

**8.1** Raytheon encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children. We urge parents to instruct their children not to provide their real names, email or physical addresses, or telephone numbers online without the permission of a parent or guardian. We recognize a special obligation to protect personal information obtained from children, as may be collected on the Children's Sites only. We fully comply with the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), which requires us to take special precautions when collecting personal information from children under the age of 13.

**8.2** In compliance with COPPA, we have adopted the following policies to help keep children safe.

  * Any personal information we collect from children under the age of 13 will be used solely by Raytheon or its agents for internal purposes only and will not be sold or otherwise distributed to third parties.
  * We will not knowingly allow children under the age of 13 to access any social media site that may exist on the Site, email accounts, or other services within Raytheon that would allow them to publicly post or otherwise distribute personal information.
  * We will not knowingly ask a child under the age of 13 to divulge more information than is needed to participate in any activity, game, or service.
  * We will not knowingly keep any personal information that is inadvertently included in a child's email submission, help inquiry, or other one-time request, if we know that the child is under the age of 13. Information will be automatically purged or purged immediately after the issue has been resolved.
  * We will not knowingly post any personal information that is inadvertently included in a child's submission to a general audience contribution area if we know that the child is under the age of 13. These submissions will be deleted and handled anonymously thereafter.
  * We will not knowingly provide any direct link to websites that are unsuitable for children or teens.
  * Upon request, we will provide a parent or guardian with a description of the information that may have been provided about their child during a registration process for a program, service or contest on the Site.



**8.3** Consistent with COPPA, there are several instances in which we collect information from children, such as:

  * Requesting the contact information of a parent or guardian for the sole purpose of notifying the parent or guardian;
  * Collecting children's contact information on a one-time basis, such as when they enter a contest or ask Raytheon a question using the "contact us" link on our Sites. We will use this information on a one-time basis solely to directly respond to the child's request. We will purge the child's contact information from our systems when we have fulfilled the request, such as after we respond to the child's email or when a contest is over. We will not use children's information to re-contact them or for any other purpose other than fulfilling their requests;
  * Collecting a child's contact information and the contact information of his/her parent or guardian solely to respond directly more than once to a specific request from the child (for example, to satisfy the request for a newsletter subscription). In this instance, the parent or guardian will be notified that the child made such a request and be informed of the information provided by the child. The parent or guardian will have an opportunity at any time to revoke the child's request (i.e., unsubscribe). We will not use the child's personal information to re-contact the child for any other purpose; and
  * Using cookies to collect non-personally-identifiable information on our child-directed Sites for analytics and internal operations purposes.

**10\. European Union/European Economic Area and Switzerland**

If You are located in the European Union ("EU") / European Economic Area ("EEA") or otherwise protected by European data protection law, the following applies.

**10.1 EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework**

To provide an adequate level of protection for personal information received from the EU/EEA, Raytheon participates in the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework ("Privacy Shield" or the "Framework").  Raytheon adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information transferred from the EU and the United Kingdom to the United States, which includes personal information about Raytheon EU employees, job applicants and individual contacts of business partners and customers. We provide notice to EU employees through separate internal company policies, and to job applicants through our recruiting and job posting websites. We are committed to subjecting such personal information to the Privacy Shield, including its Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability.

We may transfer the personal information we collect to recipients in countries other than the country in which the information originally was collected. Those countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which the information was initially provided. 

If there is any conflict between the terms in this Section on Privacy Shield and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern to the extent of the conflict. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program visit [www.privacyshield.gov](https://www.privacyshield.gov/), and to located and view our certification, please visit [https://www.privacyshield.gov/list](https://www.privacyshield.gov/list).

**10** **.1.1 Choices**

In addition to the rights provided under local law, You are afforded under Privacy Shield a specific right to access Your personal information. You may also have the right to exercise choices (opt-out) from our use of Your personal information for direct marketing purposes. To exercise this right, please follow the instructions in any direct marketing message You may have received. We do not otherwise use or disclose Your personal information in a manner that is subject to choice requirements under the Framework. 

**10.1.2 Recourse, Enforcement, and Liability**

Please contact us as specified below in Section 13 if You have any questions, need access to Your personal information, or otherwise need assistance. We remain responsible for our collection, use and disclosure of Your personal information in accordance with the Framework. We also are responsible for third party agents that are processing such personal information on our behalf, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. In certain situations, we may be required to disclose Your personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including meeting national security or law enforcement requirements.

If You have an unresolved concern about Your personal information that we have not addressed satisfactorily, we have committed to cooperate with the panel established by the EU Data Protection Authorities to serve as our independent dispute resolution body for the Framework. We are also subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission with respect to the Framework. In addition, under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield [website](https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint), individuals may invoke binding arbitration for non-monetary issues when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.

**10.1.3 Contact Us**

Please contact us using the contact information under in Section 13 below if You have any questions related to the Framework, wish to exercise Your rights of access, or wish to seek other assistance as described above.

**10.2 Additional Information under the EU General Data Protection Regulation**

This Section provides additional information as required by the EU General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR").

**10.2.1 Data Controller and Legal grounds for the processing**

If You are a Visitor of the Sites, Raytheon Company as identified in Section 13 is the data controller of Your personal data. If You are a business partner or customer, the Raytheon entity with whom You interact is the data controller. Please contact Raytheon Company in order to receive the contact details of such other Raytheon entity acting as Your data controller.

Raytheon relies on the following legal grounds for the processing of Your personal information as provided under the GDPR:

  * The processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of You which require protection of personal data, in particular if You are a child; such legitimate interests are the provision of the Sites and its services as requested by You, the promotion and advertisement of our services, communicating with you, and compliance with legal obligations and internal policies and procedures (Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR)
  * Your consent to the processing of Your personal information for one or more specific purposes; 
  * the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which You are a party or to take steps at Your request prior to entering into a contract;
  * the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject;



The provision of Your personal information is typically not required by law or contract and is therefore voluntary. However, if You do not provide Your personal information, Raytheon may not be able to make the Site and its services available to You and to response to Your request or inquiry. Similarly, if You have entered or want to enter into a contract with Raytheon, Your personal information may be necessary to pursue this purpose. 

**10.2.2 International transfers.**

Raytheon is located in the US and You therefore need to expect that Raytheon and other recipients of Your personal information are located outside the EU/EEA.

  * Raytheon and its US affiliates are certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and thereby recognized as providing an adequate level of data protection from a European data protection law perspective.
  * Other recipients located outside of the EU/EEA are also certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield or are located in countries with adequacy decisions pursuant to Art. 45 GDPR (in particular, Canada (for non-public organizations subject to the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act), Switzerland, Israel), and, in each case, the transfer is thereby recognized as providing an adequate level of data protection from an European data protection law perspective. 
  * Other recipients might be located in countries which do not adduce an adequate level of protection from an European data protection law perspective (in particular, certain recipients in the USA which are not certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield). We will take all necessary measures to ensure that transfers out of the EU/EEA are adequately protected as required by applicable data protection law. 
    * With respect to transfers to countries not providing an adequate level of data protection, we will base the transfer on appropriate safeguards, such as standard data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission or by a supervisory authority (Art. 46(2)(c) or (d) GDPR), approved codes of conduct together with binding and enforceable commitments of the recipient (Art. 46 (2)(e) GDPR), or approved certification mechanisms together with binding and enforceable commitments of the recipient (Art. 46 (2)(f) GDPR). You can ask for a copy of such appropriate safeguards by contacting us as set out in Section 13 below.
    * The data transfers to Raytheon affiliates and other third-party service providers which are neither certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield nor in a country with other adequacy decision are typically protected by standard data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission (Art. 46(2)(c) or (d) GDPR).



**10.2.3 Retention Periods**

Your personal information is stored strictly to the extent necessary for the performance of our obligations and strictly for the time necessary to achieve the purposes for which the personal information is collected, in accordance with applicable data protection laws. When Raytheon no longer needs to use Your personal information, we will remove it from our systems and records and/or take steps to properly anonymize it so that You can no longer be identified from it (unless we need to keep Your personal information to comply with legal or regulatory obligations to which Raytheon is subject). 

Personal information will in principle be deleted 3 years after the last interaction and business contact between You and Raytheon, unless a longer retention is necessary to protect our interests. However, we will retain Your contact details and interests in our products or services for a longer period of time if Raytheon is allowed to continue sending You marketing materials. 

**10.2.4 Your Rights under GDPR**

In addition to or supplementing the rights set out above in Section 5 and 9, You have the following rights under GDPR: (i) request access to Your personal information; (ii) request rectification of Your personal information; (iii) request erasure of Your personal information; (iv) request restriction of processing of Your personal information; (v) request data portability; (vi) object to the processing of Your personal information (including objection to profiling), and (vi) withdrawal of Your consent at any time. Below please find further information on Your rights to the extent that the GDPR applies. Please note that these rights might be limited under the applicable local data protection law.

  * **Right to request access to Your personal information:** As provided by applicable data protection law, **** You have the right to obtain from us confirmation as to whether or not personal information concerning You is being processed, and, where that is the case, to request access to the personal information. This access information includes – inter alia – the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal information concerned, and the recipients or categories of recipient to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed. However, this is not an absolute right and the interests of other individuals may restrict Your right of access. You may have the right to obtain a copy of the personal information undergoing processing free of charge. For further copies requested by You, we may charge a reasonable fee based on administrative costs.
  * **Right to request rectification:** As provided by applicable data protection law, **** You have the right to obtain from us the rectification of inaccurate personal information concerning You. Depending on the purposes of the processing, You may have the right to have incomplete personal information completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.
  * **Right to request erasure (right to be forgotten):** As provided by applicable data protection law, **Y** ou have the right to obtain from us the erasure of personal information concerning You and we may be obliged to erase such personal information.
  * **Right to request restriction of processing:** As provided by applicable data protection law, You have the right to obtain from us that we restrict the processing of Your personal information. In such case, the respective information will be marked and may only be processed by us for certain purposes.
  * **Right to request data portability:** As provided by applicable data protection law, **** You have the right to receive the personal information concerning You, which You have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and You may have the right to transmit those information to another entity without hindrance from us.
  * **Right to object:**



**Under certain circumstances, You have the right to object, on grounds relating to Your particular situation, at any time to the processing of Your personal information by us and we are required to no longer process Your personal information. Such right to object especially applies if we collect and process Your personal information for profiling purposes in order to better understand Your interests in our products and services or for certain types of direct marketing.**

**If You have a right to object and if You exercise this right, Your personal information will no longer be processed for such purposes by us.**

**Such a right to object may, in particular, not exist if the processing of Your personal information is necessary to take steps prior to entering into a contract or to perform a contract already concluded.**

  * **Right to withdraw Your consent:** If You have declared Your consent regarding certain collecting, processing and use of Your personal information (in particular regarding the receipt of direct marketing communication via email, SMS/MMS, fax, and telephone), You can withdraw this consent at any time with future effect. Such a withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of the processing prior to the consent withdrawal. 



To exercise Your rights, please contact us as stated under Section 13 below.You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent data protection supervisory authority in the relevant Member State (e.g., the place where You reside, work, or of an alleged infringement of the GDPR).
