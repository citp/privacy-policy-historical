_**Raymour & Flanigan® Furniture Privacy Policy**_ ****

Raymour & Flanigan® Furniture respects your privacy. Our goal is to be your furniture retailer of choice by developing a relationship based on mutual trust. Personal information which you choose to share with Raymour & Flanigan® will be treated in accordance with the following policies: 

**Your Transmission of Personal Data Is Secure.**

When we ask you to send us information that needs to be protected (Social Security numbers, account numbers, etc.), we utilize a technology called SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). This technology encrypts information before it is sent across the Internet. The encrypted information is only decoded after it reaches the secure Raymour & Flanigan® site. 

It is our policy not to ask you to send any sensitive information via e-mail, because e-mail is not a secure form of communication. 

**We Collect the Least Amount of Information about You as Possible.**

Please be assured we will only ask for information required to enhance your furniture-shopping experience. If you elect to sign up for updates and newsletters, we only need your e-mail address. However, we will ask for your name, **as an option** , so that we may personalize the correspondence we send. 

Raymour & Flanigan® will not sell, barter, or exchange any information about you with another company or service. 

Raymour & Flanigan® may release account information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with law, (ii) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements, or (iii) protect the rights, property, or safety of Raymour & Flanigan®, our users, or others. 

You may remove your name from our e-mail list by selecting "Unsubscribe" in the [become a Raymour & Flanigan member](https://web.archive.org/web/20040604095603id_/http%3A//www.raymourflanigan.com/submembers.htm) section. 

**How We Use Cookies.**

"Cookies" are small files which Web sites store in your computer's hard drive. Raymour & Flanigan® uses cookies to see how often you visit our site and what features and information you use. We do not track anything else related to your Web habits. Again, our only aim is to maximize our ability to serve your home furnishing needs. 

If you do not want to accept cookies, you can accomplish this by changing the settings of your browser. 

**You Will Know in Advance if Our Policy Changes.**

While we do not foresee the need to change any of our privacy policies, should we feel the need to do so, we will post the revised policy at least thirty days prior to the effective date so that you always know what information we collect and how we use it.
