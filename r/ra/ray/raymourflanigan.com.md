Cookies allow us to enhance and customize your online shopping experience and improve the design of our site. These cookies store random ID numbers and site navigation information such as your first and last visits, number of visits, shopping cart contents, and the pages you viewed on our website.

## When and With Whom We Share Your Personal Information

We never **_sell or rent_** your personal information to any third parties under any circumstances.

We will share personal customer information only with our agents, representatives, service providers, and contractors for limited purposes, including fulfilling customer orders; offering certain products and services in connection with raymourflanigan.com; communicating to customers; providing customer service; enhancing and improving customers' shopping experience; enabling access to our partners' web sites; providing a personalized shopping experience; preventing fraud; and completing payment method processing.

Aside from the purposes described above, we will never share your personal information with any other third parties unless we have your express permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the disclosure is required to prevent harm or injury (such as product recalls, fraud, claims or other liability) or to comply with valid legal processes (subpoenas, warrants) or as required by law. We may share aggregated demographic and statistical information with our partners. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

## How We Protect the Security of Your Personal Information

Protecting the safety of your personal information is important to us. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology from Verisign to protect the security of your credit card and personal information as it is transmitted to us.

SSL is the gold standard in Internet encryption technology. It is a highly sophisticated method of scrambling data as it travels from your computer directly to our web servers.

To make sure you are accessing our secure server before you submit personal and financial information, look at the lower right-hand corner of your browser. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock icon (depending upon your browser), then SSL is active. To double-check for security, look at the URL or web address line of your browser. If you have accessed a secure server, the first characters of the address in that line should change from "http" to "https."

Some browser versions and some firewalls don't permit communication through secure servers like the ones we use to process orders at raymourflanigan.com. If for any reason you cannot access the secure server, please feel free to place your order with us by phone toll free at 1.866.383.4484. Our Customer Service representatives will be happy to assist you.
