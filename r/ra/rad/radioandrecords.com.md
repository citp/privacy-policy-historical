**PRIVACY POLICY & USERS RIGHTS**  
  
This site is part of The Nielsen Company network of web sites.

At The Nielsen Company we take your privacy very seriously. Because of this we want to provide you with explicit information on how we collect, gather, and identify information during your visit to our site. This information may be expanded or updated as we change or develop our site. For this reason, we recommend that you review this policy from time-to-time to see if anything has changed. Your continued use of our site signifies your acceptance of our privacy policy.  
Personally Identifiable Information refers to information that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name, phone number, email or postal address. In many cases we need this information to provide the personalized or enhanced service that you have requested.

The amount of Personally Identifiable Information that you choose to disclose to The Nielsen Company is completely up to you. The only way we know something about you personally is if you provide it to us in conjunction with one of our services.

**What information do we collect and how do we use it?  
**  
The Nielsen Company collects information on our users in three ways: by your voluntary submissions (for instance, if you sign up for one of our email newsletters) and/or surveys; sweepstakes and/or contest entries; and through cookie technology.

In our effort to provide personalization and opportunities for prizes and services, we may at times ask you to submit information such as your name or email address, or to share your interests and hobbies with us. You never have to answer these questions, and you can decline this exchange of information on any site on the Internet - not just ours - at any time. However, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with some of the services dependent upon the collection of this information, such as a personalized stock portfolio, a sweepstakes entry, or the purchase and shipment of products and prizes to people who visit our network.

The information The Nielsen Company collects is used in a variety of ways: for internal review; to improve the content of the site, thus making your user experience more valuable; to notify you about updates to the service; and to let you know about products and services that you may be interested in.

Email: If you have provided us your email address, The Nielsen Company periodically sends promotional emails to its subscribers about services offered by The Nielsen Company and its partners. If you do not wish to receive email information from The Nielsen Company, please let us know by emailing us at: [rrwebmaster@radioandrecords.com](mailto:rrwebmaster@radioandrecords.com) or by writing us at Radio & Records, Inc.,   
5055 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 600, Los Angeles, CA 90036.

The "email this article" feature is an easy way for you to send articles through email. The email addresses that you supply to use this service will not be used for any other purpose without your consent.

From time to time we share this information with other reputable organizations for marketing purposes or the information is used by The Nielsen Company to contact consumers for its own marketing endeavors. As a valued consumer, we offer you the opportunity to "opt out," or request not to accept these marketing opportunities.
