Until you set your privacy settings, our default privacy settings will show only limited information, such as your name, town and state. This information will be visible to everyone who searches you by name. People within the same groups as you can also see that you belong to the same group as they do. Control of information obtained from publicly accessible external sources is beyond our control. Please contact these sources directly if you with them to remove certain information.

<br>

<p>
By submitting personal information to the Radaris web site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and expressly consent to the processing of your personal information according to this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<br>

<p><strong>1.  SITE INFORMATION SOURCE.</strong></p>
Radaris purchases publicly available information from sources like telephone companies and other public directories.  If our information is outdated we encourage users to register and correct that data and to seek out the original sources for that error.  Upon request we can research and provide the public sources of the information we display.  

<br><br>

<p><strong>2. INFORMATION WE COLLECT.</strong></p>
Radaris collects personal information such as name, email address, age and other information that is submitted knowingly and voluntarily through our web-site. We collect information during following instances-<br>
a) During your registration at the Radaris web site, we will collect information that you provide us.<br>
b) Whenever you save the personal information in your profile or in the profiles of the people you know, we will collect the information you enter.<br>
c) Whenever you enter personal information throughout the Radaris web site using one of the Radaris's tools and features, we will collect the information you enter.<br>
d) Whenever information is recorded, in any form or field on the Radaris web site, we collect information about the time and date of submission, as well as the person submitting such information.<br>
e) Whenever you contact us by sending us an e-mail, we will collect your e-mail addresses and any information contained in the e-mail you send us.

<br><br>

<p>
Radaris collects other profile data, including, but not limited to: personal interests, gender, age, education, connections with other people or communities, and occupation, in order to assist users in finding and communicating with each other.
</p>

<br>

Radaris also logs non-personally-identifiable information including IP address, profile information, aggregate user data, and browser type, from users and visitors to the site. This data is used to manage the website, track usage and improve the website services. This non-personally-identifiable information may be shared with third-parties to provide more relevant services and advertisements to members. User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes.

<br><br>

<p><strong>3. INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE.</strong></p>
Profile owner can set their own privacy settings about what information can be disclosed or shared with others, and in what manner. To facilitate the searching of people, users are allowed to search using first and last name, email address, contact information, schools, companies, and communities users may have been affiliated with. If profile owner does not specify privacy settings, the default settings will be used. The default settings allow searching for a person by name and address. However, once a person is found, his or her profile is not accessible to everyone. If a profile is linked to a certain group or community, other members of these groups will be able to see the affiliation to that group. Deleted information may still exist in back up copies, but will not be accessible to the public.
<p>

<br>

With the exception of inviting friends, adding friends, and sending account notifications, a member's email address is not shared or displayed to others, unless profile owner grants such permission.

Profile owner may specify the types of emails that they wish to receive under their notification settings "Do not send me notification emails" in the user "Account Settings".
</p>

<br>

Radaris will penalize users who post incorrect, abusive, or false information about other users by revoking account privileges, upon learning of such actions.

<br>

<p>
Except as otherwise described in this privacy statement, Radaris will not disclose personal information to any third party unless we believe that disclosure is necessary: (1) to conform to legal requirements or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other legal process received by Radaris, whether or not a response is required by applicable law; (2) to enforce the Radaris Terms of Service Agreement or to protect our rights; or (3) to protect the safety of members of the public and users of the service.
</p>

<br>

We do not provide your contact information to third parties marketing companies without your permission.

<br><br>

<p><strong>4. STORING OF INFORMATION.</strong></p>
