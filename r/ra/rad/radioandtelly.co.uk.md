#### Site advertising

This site is funded by advertisements. We do not charge visitors for any or our services, nor do we offer any kind of paid subscription service.

As with many websites, we promote a number of selected advertisers using the “affiliate scheme” model. Parts of our site contain banner advertisements and in-content text links to advertisers. This means that, in some cases, a small percentage of any sales generated by our visitors, is apportioned to the site owners to support ongoing site costs.

Where possible, it is our policy to promote products and services only where a member of the Radio and Telly team has experience of using them, but the nature of online contextual advertising means that this is not always possible.

Some of the advertising services used on this site make use of tracking ‘cookies’. For more information on how these may be used, please see our [Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20190606114124id_/https%3A//www.radioandtelly.co.uk/privacypolicy.html).

Radio and Telly is a participant in the Amazon Europe S.à r.l. Associates Programme, an affiliate advertising programme designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.co.uk

 **Advertisers:** If you are looking to advertise on this site, note that we normally only consider advertising from companies that are affiliated with one of a number of [affiliate networks](http://www.consumerdeals.co.uk/affiliate.html). We do not accept paid links, and we do not do paid reviews. Note that our audience is predominantly UK-based.
