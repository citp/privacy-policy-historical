Cookies are small amounts of data that are stored in separate files within your computer's Internet browser. Cookies are accessed and recorded by the websites you visit, and by the companies that show advertisements on these websites, so that they can recognize the same browser.

Web beacons (sometimes called transparent GIFs, clear GIFs, or web bugs) are small strings of code that provide a way for us to deliver a small graphic image (usually invisible) on a web page or in an email. Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on your computer such as cookies, the time and date a page is viewed, and a description of the page where the web beacon is placed. 

**How CBS Local Services Use Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Similar Technologies**  
CBS Local Services use cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies for the following general purposes:

  * To help us recognize your browser as a previous visitor and to save and remember any preferences that may have been set while your browser was visiting one of our Services. For example, if you register on a CBS Local Service, that Service may use a cookie to identify you so that you will not have to log in each time you visit the Service.
  * To help us customize the content and advertisements you are shown while visiting CBS Local Services and potentially other websites. Please read CBS Local Online Advertising  to learn more about our efforts to show you relevant advertising.

For instance, [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/policy.php), [Google](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/privacy?lang=en) place their cookies on CBS Local Services to support social network integration and functionality and for use according to their respective privacy policies. For more information, please see the Video Services and Social Networking Policy.
  * Web beacons are used to improve your experience on the CBS Local Services, including helping provide you with content customized to your interests.

Our web beacons may collect some contact information (e.g., the email address associated with an email that contains a web beacon).
  * CBS Local Services also may include third party web beacons. These web beacons allow third party service providers to collect certain information such as your IP address, your browser type, and the web page that you visited before arriving at and after leaving CBS Local Services. These service providers process the information they collect to audit, research, and report information about the CBS Local Services and advertisements viewed on the CBS Local Services.

Also, authorized third party service providers may collect non-contact information about your visits to our Services with cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies that may be used to deliver advertisements or marketing tailored to your interests. These third parties may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites.

By continuing to use CBS Local Services, you consent to our use of cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies as described above.

#### CBS Local Children’s Privacy Policy

CBS Local Services recognize the need to provide additional privacy protections when children visit the websites on which this CBS Local Children's Privacy Policy is posted. The following guidelines supplement our general  Privacy Policy and follow the rules set by the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and other applicable laws. When we use the term “child" or “children" below, we mean an individual under 13 years of age or an individual under 18 years of age where the collection, use, or disclosure of personal information about such an individual is restricted by applicable law. When we use the term "parent" below, we mean to include legal guardians. 

**Information We Collect**  
Children can enjoy content and features on CBS Local Services without directly providing contact information. However, children who wish to participate in sweepstakes, contests, and certain other special activities may need to provide information such as first name, user name, password, email address, date of birth, city and state of residence, and gender.

In the course of participating in interactive features such as chat rooms and message boards, a child may provide us with additional information about himself or herself, such as the contents of his or her postings. Some information, including information collected through  cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies may be collected automatically. For more information, see the "Information we collect automatically on CBS Local Services" section of our general privacy policy.

If we knowingly collect, use or disclose contact information collected from a child, we will provide you notice and obtain parental consent in accordance with applicable law. 

We do not condition a child's participation in an online activity on the child's providing more contact information than is reasonably necessary to participate in that activity. 

Use of Information 

We use the information we collect consistent with the services requested by the child. For example, we may use information provided by the child to: 

  * Send a newsletter, electronic card, and other communication requested by the child;
  * Enable a child's participation in certain interactive features such as games, contests, message boards, chat rooms, song requests, and online scrolling tickers; and
  * Respond to correspondence sent by the child.



  
We may also use a parent's contact information to communicate with the parent regarding the child's activities on CBS Local Services. For example, if a child wins a sweepstakes or contest, we may use the parent's contact information to conduct prize fulfillment. 

**Disclosure of Information Collected**  
Information collected from children will be disclosed in the same ways described in the Disclosure of Information Collected section of our general Privacy Policy. Third parties who receive contact information collected by CBS Local have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of that information. Parents have the option not to consent to the disclosure of their child's contact information to third parties. Parents may also consent to CBS Local's collection and use of their child's contact information while refusing to permit the disclosure of that information to third parties. 

**Parents' Choices and Access to Children's Information**   
Parents may review the contact information we have collected from their child, refuse to permit us to collect further contact information from their child, and request that any contact information we have collected be deleted from our records. 

To review, update or delete your child's contact information, please [contact us](http://policies.cbslocal.com/privacy/generalinfo.html). You may also send your request to the postal address listed below. To protect your child's safety, we ask for proof of your identity. We may deny access if we believe there is a question about your identity. 

Please note that certain information cannot be deleted because of other legal obligations, such as FCC requirements. 

**Changes to the CBS Local Children's Privacy Policy**  
We may amend the CBS Local Children's Privacy Policy at any time and will make material changes only in conformance with applicable law. We will provide parents with notice of any material changes in the way we intend to collect, use, and share children's contact information. Accordingly, parents should update their contact information to provide us with current email addresses at all times.

These companies may offer you a way to choose not to have your information used for advertising purposes. To learn more, click here.

Does CBS Local share contact information with other websites or services owned by CBS Corporation? As CBS Corporation continues to expand its online offerings, we will share information with other websites owned by our parent, CBS Corporation, so that we can inform our users better about products and services in which they may be interested.

Do you use my data for advertising on CBS Local Services? Like other websites, we are able to offer free content and services through the revenue we receive from advertising on CBS Local Services.

This advertising does not result in you seeing more advertisements; rather, it just means you’ll see more relevant advertisements. To learn more, click here.
