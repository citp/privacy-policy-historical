This information is collected in a database and used–in an aggregated, anonymous manner–in our internal analysis of traffic patterns within our Web site. This information is automatically logged by most Web sites.

Use of Information

Our primary goal in collecting user information is to enhance your experience on our Web site.

To Target Content  
To develop content targeted to your interests, we use aggregated user information to determine which areas of our Web site users prefer based upon traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but instead how well each page or content area performs overall.

To Provide Interactive Communications From Radiosargam.com  
To enhance your experience we may provide you with interactive communications, such as our electronic newsletters, to the e-mail address that you provide to us. Such interactive communications are provided only to those users who have expressly provided us with their permission to receive them as part of their user profile.

From time to time we may provide e-mails highlighting new features, promotions or contests on the Web site to those users who have expressly provided us with their permission to send such communications as part of their user profile.

To Provide Communications From Third Parties  
We respect the privacy of our users and shall not disclose or distribute our user list to any third party, nor shall it permit anyone else to do so. However, we do make available for rental our list of those registrants who have expressly provided us with their permission to receive third party information and offers as part of their user profile. In those cases, your personal information is not transferred to the third party.

Control of Your Information  
Users may change their user profile to stop receiving newsletters or marketing material from Radiosargam.com or on behalf of external third party business partners.

Sharing of Information  
When you are on an area of Radiosargam.com and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with Radiosargam.com as well as business partners and vendors providing hosting and other services for Radiosargam.com. If you do not want your information to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of your information by not using that particular service. In addition, any personally identifiable information provided by our users as part of an advertiser promotion online may be provided directly to advertisers.

Aggregate, Anonymous Information With Advertisers  
Radiosargam.com derives the majority of its revenue from advertising and sharing information is essential to keeping our services affordable to users. In order to attract and retain advertisers we use the aggregated, anonymous information that we gather (as well as information from third-party market researchers) to describe our services to partners and to assist our advertisers and sponsors to better understand our audience. We do not disclose personally identifying information about our users to these parties.

As Necessary to Provide Services to You  
We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf. We will only provide those companies the personal information they need to deliver the service. In some instances, one of these companies may collect information directly from you (such as for credit card processing). In these cases, you will be notified of the involvement of the external service provider. In all cases, these companies are subject to agreements that require them to maintain the confidentiality of your information and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

As Required By Law  
Radiosargam.com may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Radiosargam.com or to protect and defend the rights or property of Radiosargam.com.

Security  
Your information is stored on Radiosargam.com’s servers. We use procedural and technical safeguards to protect your personal information against loss or theft as well as unauthorized access and disclosure to protect your privacy, including encryption, “firewalls” and Secure Socket Layers. We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company. However, “perfect security” does not exist on the Internet.

Privacy of Children  
Kids under 13: Do not send any information about yourself to us–including information such as your name, address, or e-mail address. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the event that we learn we have collected any personal information from a child under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information from our database as quickly as possible.

How to Contact Us  
If you have any questions regarding our privacy statement, please feel free to contact us by e-mail at radiosargam@hotmail.com. We read every message submitted and try to reply promptly to every one.

How Will I Know if the Privacy Policy Is Changed?  
This statement may change from time to time, so please check back periodically. [If we are going to be using the information collected from users in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection, we will send affected users written notice of the change by e-mail.]
