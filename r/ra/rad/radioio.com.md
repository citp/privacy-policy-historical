information about all users of radioio 

our service automatically gathers certain usage information, like the numbers and frequency of visitors to radioio.com and listeners of the radioio programming, very much like television ratings that tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program (measurecast and arbitron webcasting services). although this data may be stored along with your personal information, we only use such data anonymously and in the aggregate. this collective data helps us determine how much our customers use parts of the service, so we can provide the best possible user experience.
