This Privacy Policy describes how the Radisson Hotel Group and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries (“we” or “us”) collects, uses, consults or otherwise processes an individual’s Personal Data.

This Privacy Policy applies globally, but depending on where you live some specific provisions of this Privacy Policy may not apply to you.

For the purposes of EU Privacy Law, depending on the type of Personal Data processing described in this Privacy Policy, Radisson Hospitality Inc., and/or Radisson Hospitality Belgium SPRL/BVBA may be operating as a sole or joint Controller. If operating as joint Controllers, both entities jointly determine the means and purposes of the processing of your Personal Data. What this means for you is that you can exercise your rights against either of the joint Controllers by contacting either company as set out below.

In some of the situations described in this Privacy Policy, the hotel where you made a booking and/or stay will also process your data as a (joint or sole) Controller. The hotel will be solely responsible for the processing activities for which it is the sole Controller.

This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you how we gather, define, and use Personal Data that you provide to us when using our websites and mobile applications or when relying on our hospitality services. Please take a moment to read this Privacy Policy carefully. Please note that if you plan to submit someone else’s Personal Data to us, for instance when making a booking on their behalf, you may only provide us with that person’s details with their consent and after they have been given access to information about how we will use their details, including the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.

This policy includes a description of your data protection rights, including a right to object to some of the processing activities we carry out. Please note that your rights as a data subject may vary depending upon where you live.

EU Privacy Law requires us to be specific about our reasons and legal grounds for using your Personal Data. Accordingly, for the purposes of EU Privacy Law only, the information below describes the types of data we process, where we get your data from, the grounds we rely on to carry out the processing, and who we may share your data with.

**iBeacon** iBeacons are electronic devices that broadcast signals that can be received by mobile devices on which one of our mobile apps is installed. If you have voluntarily installed one of our apps on your device, and if you have granted permission for the app to track your location, then iBeacons installed in our hotels may send a signal to the app on your device about the precise, real-time location of the device. The app may use this information to deliver special offers and promotions to you, at a time and place when the information is most relevant. For example, if you are in one of our hotels late in the afternoon, your mobile device may receive a signal from an iBeacon that causes the app to notify you about drink or dinner specials. As a convenience to you, receipt of the iBeacons signal and delivery of the special offer or promotion may occur even if you are not currently using the app. To make our mobile apps and services operate better, we may also collect other information based on iBeacon signals, for example, the strength of the signal between the iBeacon and your device, the duration your device is near the iBeacon, or the battery level of the iBeacon itself. To avoid having us receive or use your precise, real-time location, do not opt in to location services. If you did opt in and have changed your mind, you may opt out of location services through your device settings or by deleting the app.
