# Radley London :: Privacy and Security

## Privacy

##### Privacy & Security

Radley is the sole owner of the information collected on this Website. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.

##### Your Data

Your privacy is of the highest importance to us, and we promise never to release your personal details to any outside company for mailing or marketing purposes without your express permission.

We may collect and process information that you provide by filling in forms on our website, details of transactions you carry out through our site and details of your visits to our site. If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence.

Any personal data gathered by us in your use of this site will be recorded electronically and only used in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act 1998.

For the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998, the data controller is Radley + Co Limited of Mornington Crescent, London NW1 7Q

##### IP Addresses and Cookies

We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.

For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file which is stored on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer's hard drive. They help us to improve our site and to deliver a better and more personalised service. They enable us: 

To estimate our audience size and usage pattern. 

To store information about your preferences, and so allow us to customise our site according to your individual interests. 

To speed up your searches. 

To recognise you when you return to our site. 

You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our site. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you log on to our site.

Please note that our advertisers may also use cookies, over which we have no control.

We will use information held about you to carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us.

We may use your data to provide you, via email, post, telephone or SMS with information, products or services that you request from us or which we feel may be of interest to you, where you have consented to be contacted for such purposes.

##### Security

We realise how important it is to securely store any information that you provide us. The Radley transactional web site currently uses high-level Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology, the most advanced security software currently available for online transactions. You can therefore rest assured that we take the security of your payment and personal details very seriously. We may vary this in the future if we feel you will benefit from greater security whilst using our Website.

You can tell whether a webpage is secure as 'https' will replace the 'http' at the front of the www.radley.co.uk in your browser address window, also a small locked padlock will appear in your browser window.

While we currently use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also protect your information off-line. All of your information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer services representative) are granted access to your personal information. The servers on which we store your personal information are kept in a secure environment.

##### Phishing

Phishing is the practice of tricking someone into giving confidential information. Examples include falsely claiming to be a legitimate company when sending an email to a user, in an attempt to get the user to send private information that will be used for identity theft and fraud.

Radley will never ask you to send any personal details via email. If we require such details, for security reasons we will ask you to contact us by telephone. Should you receive an email claiming to be from Radley & Co requesting this kind of information please do not respond but contact us immediately.

##### Complaints
