**RadarSync Desktop Client.**

> RadarSync regularly contacts RadarSync's and your device manufacturer's update servers to check if newer versions of RadarSync, device drivers, or pre-installed software updates are available. If newer versions are available, RadarSync will notify the user and give the user the option to upgrade. The user has the ability to disable the update check at any time.

These advertisements and offers are targeted based on your computer information (type, features, upgrade needs), but not based on any personal information about you. Users have the option of configuring RadarSync so that they do not receive these product offers and promotions.
