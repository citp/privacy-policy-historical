This guest privacy policy ("Policy") describes how we at the Rezidor Hotel Group, acting through our Danish brand holding company Rezidor Hospitality A/S, or any of its affiliates ("Rezidor") collect, use, share, and protect our guests' personal information. "Personal information" is information, recorded in any format that identifies you personally, by itself or together with other information that is available to us.</p><p class="fw-article black-normal">This Policy does not apply to the practices of businesses or websites which we do not own or control, not to people we do not employ or manage. Rezidor holds a license to operate itself or allow others to operate hotels in Europe, the Middle East and Africa under the brands "Radisson Blu", "Park Inn", "Regent", "Country Inns &amp; Suites" and "Hotel Missoni" (collectively the "Rezidor Brand Hotels").</p><p class="fw-article black-normal">Some of the Rezidor Brand Hotels are owned and operated by independent franchisees. <strong>This Policy does not cover our franchisees' privacy practices.</strong> When you provide personal information directly to one of our franchisees, the franchisee's privacy policy will apply. Please note that we require our franchisees to have privacy policies that are consistent with our Privacy Commitment and to comply with all applicable privacy and data protection laws, though their actual privacy policies may be different from this Policy.</p><p class="fw-article black-normal">Our sites may include links to other websites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Rezidor. In some cases, when linking to another site you may still see our branding even though you are actually reviewing content provided by a third party. If you submit personal information while on those sites, your information is subject to their privacy policies and you should review those policies.</p><p class="fw-article black-normal"><a id="HEADLINE_2" name="HEADLINE_2"></a></p><p class="fw-article black-normal"><strong>Your Consent to This Policy</strong><br>
This Policy is part of the terms and conditions that govern your use of our services. By using our websites, the central reservation system, staying at any of the Rezidor Brand Hotels, you are agreeing for us to use your personal information in accordance with the applicable laws.<br>
We will keep your personal information as long as we need it for the purposes of which we collected it, or as permitted by law.</p><p class="fw-article black-normal"><a id="HEADLINE_3" name="HEADLINE_3"></a></p><p class="fw-article black-normal"><strong>Personal information we collect about you</strong></p><ul class="fw-article black-normal">

<li>We collect personal information about our guests from public sources and from other companies that have the right to share that information with us.</li>

<li>If you provide us personal information about others, for example, in a "Send to a Friend" feature, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us. We do not store this information.</li>

Different countries have different data protection laws, some of which provide more protection than others. If and when we transfer your personal information from one country to another country, we take appropriate measures to protect your privacy and personal information in accordance with the EU legislation for international data transfers (Safe Harbor Framework). By using our websites, participating in our programs, or staying at Rezidor Brand Hotels, you are consenting to the transfer of your personal information to any country in the world in accordance with the terms of this Policy.</p><p class="fw-article black-normal"><a id="HEADLINE_9" name="HEADLINE_9"></a></p><p class="fw-article black-normal"><strong>Cookies and Other Web Technologies<br>
</strong>When you visit one of our websites, we may use the following web technologies to collect the following types of information:</p><ul class="fw-article black-normal">
<li>We collect information that is sent to us automatically by your web browser when you access our websites. This information typically includes the IP address of your Internet service provider and the type of operating system and browser installed on your computer.</li>

<li>A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer's hard disk by a web server.</li>

<li>We use "Session cookies" to assign a randomly-generated unique identification number to your computer each time you visit one of our websites. A session cookie expires after you close your browser. We use session cookies to support the functionality of our websites - which pages they visit, which links they use, and how long they stay on each page. We may also use "persistent cookies." These cookies do not expire immediately after you close your browser, but stay on your computer until they expire after a period of time or you delete them. Each time you visit the same website, our web server will recognize the cookie on your computer's hard drive. By assigning your computer a persistent, unique identifier, we are able to create a database of your previous choices and preferences. In situations where these choices or preferences need to be collected again, they can be provided by us automatically saving you time and effort. Assigning your computer a persistent, unique identifier also helps us keep a more accurate account of how many people visit our websites, how often they return, how their use of our websites may vary over time, and the effectiveness of our promotional efforts. If you access our websites through an e-mail we have sent you or you've created a "user identity" during one of your visits, the information provided by our or our third party service provider cookies may be linked to information in our records that identifies you personally.</li>

<li>The pages on our websites may contain electronic images known as "web beacons" - sometimes called "single-pixel gifs" or "clear gifs." We use these web beacons to learn more about the ways visitors use our web sites and to measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. We may also include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. We may link information obtained using any web beacons to other information that identifies you personally.</li>
</ul><p class="fw-article black-normal"><strong>Modifications to this Policy</strong></p><ul class="fw-article black-normal">
<li>We reserve the right, at our discretion, to make changes to this Policy at any time.</li>

<li>We will notify you of any material changes to this Policy by posting a note on the top of the revised Privacy Policy section for at least 30 days after the new effective date to let you know what has changed. It is your responsibility to check our website periodically for changes to this Policy.</li>

<li>If we make only minor changes to this Policy, we will replace this Policy with the new Policy and change the effective date at the top of this Policy. Minor changes include, for example, changes to our contact information or the examples contained in a section of this Policy.<br>
