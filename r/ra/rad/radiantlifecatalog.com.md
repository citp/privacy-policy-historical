**Privacy Policy Updated May 24th, 2018**

[Proposition 65](http://oehha.ca.gov/proposition-65/general-info/proposition-65-plain-language) or the “Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act” is a unique California law that requires businesses to place a warning label on products that contain any one of a list of over 800+ different chemicals, even if these substances are naturally occurring and present in trace amounts.

Under this law, some of our foods and botanicals are required to carry the following notice:

 _Warning: This product contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause birth defects or reproductive harm._

Proposition 65 was an initiative originally passed in 1986 to address growing concerns about the dumping of toxic material into food and water supplies. Fundamentally this law is well-intentioned and supports environmental consciousness. However, in practice Prop 65 is often misconstrued and has brought with it many unforeseen consequences. Some of these effects have been challenging for small family companies like ours.

Any food grown on clean, organic-certified soil contains naturally occurring minerals in small amounts. The diverse spectrum of minerals in the soil—including calcium, iron and zinc—are taken up into plant material as part of the natural growth process. These nutrients are very important to our health and well being when obtained in appropriate amounts. At the right dose, these minerals help to support a wide range of bodily functions from building strong bones to supporting the brain. However, like any substance, they are not beneficial when taken in extreme quantities.

Soil also contains minuscule amounts of metals. These too are not harmful when consumed in tiny amounts and can in fact be perfectly healthy. Virtually all foods grown in the earth’s rich, healthy soils have the potential to include small quantities of metals like lead and cadmium.

It is important to keep in mind that the metals found in plants are altogether different than the heavy metals that are mined, chemically treated and concentrated for use in industrial products. Obviously, these industrial metals should be carefully kept out of our air, water and food supplies. However the benign metals found in clean, fresh produce are not a threat. They are present in tiny amounts, bound and integrated into the plant fibers—where they have always been and will stay.

Nonetheless lead is one of the most frequently cited chemicals in Prop 65. Levels exceeding 0.5 micrograms require a label. This is approximately 1,000 times lower than the amount known to cause reproductive harm according to the federal government. Because these levels are hard to assess and regulate in any given product, many manufacturers have made the choice to label all products that could even just possibly have lead in them. This includes some of our [Superfood Supplements](https://web.archive.org/category/superfoods-supplements) and [Nutrient Dense Foods](https://web.archive.org/web/20180903133959id_/https%3A//www.radiantlifecatalog.com/category/nutrient-dense-foods). Labeling in this way helps to safeguard against potential lawsuits in California, but it does not mean that the products themselves are unsafe.

Numerous industries have found Proposition 65 difficult to comply with. Not only are regulations hard to follow, but enforcement has been difficult and inconsistent. It is also important to note that because Prop 65 was passed by a ballot initiative, it falls outside of the usual legislative process and is difficult to update or change in anyway.

Prop 65 is enforced entirely by way of civil lawsuits brought on by organizations and, on some occasions, by the state’s attorney general. These suits can be crippling and resource-draining for small companies. Stakes for settlements are high and proceedings can involve considerable sums of money.

In an attempt to prevent legal action of any kind, many companies have opted to post Prop 65 labels and signs. Warning signs appear all over the state of California in restaurants, banks, hotels, gas stations, and all other facilities that could even just possibly contain traces of any one of the 800 chemicals mentioned in the law.

Other companies may elect not to provide warnings because, in their assessment, they conclude they are in full compliance with Prop 65 and are willing to take the risk of legal action. Two identical products can therefore have labeling differences simply because of company philosophy.

Even though Prop 65 was designed for use in California only, you may receive products with warnings on them even if you are not a resident of this state. This is because our company is based in California, and all of our shipping and receiving facilities are also located here. When manufacturers send us goods, they are required to add Prop 65 warming labels before those products can enter state lines. We have made the choice to leave these stickers on the packages regardless of their final destination. In the end we decided that our resources are best spent on finding ways to bring you the best organic products on the market, not on removing these stickers. We hope you understand!

We follow a very strict set of purity guidelines when selecting products to become part of our catalog. Long before products even make it to our shelves, they undergo rigorous analysis and testing. Our team works very closely with our suppliers to ensure that safety standards are met along each step of the way, from how foods are farmed to how they are prepared, packaged and delivered to your door. This type of ongoing monitoring and research is at the very heart of our business model.
