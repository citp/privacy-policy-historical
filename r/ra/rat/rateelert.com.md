**Why must you give so much personal information?**

In order to provide the most accurate rate possible with NO surprises, we hate that too, Insurance companies establish their rates using a variety of criteria. Since we deal with hundreds of companies, we must ask you questions required by all of them to determine the most competitive match for you. Besides, you would never go to the doctor and when he asks “how ya feeling today or what hurts today ” respond with “Gee, Doc, why do you need to know that information!” Its simple , to recommend the best possible coverage for you, insurance carriers need to know some basic info on you or else they will prescribe the wrong medicine or treatment(ouch). 

             **NOTICE OF CONSUMER REPORT PRACTICES** In some cases, insurance companies may need to obtain additional background information about you.
