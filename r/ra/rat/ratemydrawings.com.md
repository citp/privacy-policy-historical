# RateMyDrawings - Privacy

> **To help you understand...**
> 
> ###### RateMyDrawings strongly believes in its members’ right to privacy.
> 
> ###### Information Collection and Use
> 
> Your privacy is important to us. We only collect information for internal use to best offer our services.   
>  1) We collect your email address for registration.  
>  2) We use browser cookies to make parts of our website work.  
>  3) Member profiles display any information you enter into them to the public. We save this data for internal uses only.  
> 
> 
> **RateMyDrawings collects three types of information:  
>  **
> 
>   1. RateMyDrawings requires user registration to interact with certain areas of our website. We therefore collect and store the e-mail address you provide in the registration process. 
>   2. We passively record information about the interaction between a web user's browser and our servers. Those interactions include user IP addresses and their interaction with drawings such as user ratings. In addition session ID cookies may be used to confirm whether a user is logged in. A cookie is a small piece of data stored on your computer through your web browser that is tied to your login information. The session ID cookie expires once your web browser is closed. This non-identifying information is collected from web users to assist in the proper function of our service. 
>   3. RateMyDrawings allows users to input personal information and preferences in the user profile section of the user’s account. Any information published by users is published at the user’s own risk. RateMyDrawings disclaims any and all liability against claims arising from information published by the user, and we do not guarantee the privacy of that information. RateMyDrawings does not collect, use, sell, or purchase the personal information provided by the user. Furthermore we may also use or share non-identifying aggregate information to better design our web site and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women registered with RateMyDrawings. However no information will be used that could identify those individuals. Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

We advise parents to monitor their children’s use of this website and we request that children under the age of 13 not provide personally identifiable information such as name, address, phone number, age or location on any public area (including your personal profile) of this website.

Parents/Guardians are required to print and fill out the consent form accurately and submit the form via mail, fax, or scan and email a pdf of the completed form to the address provided on the form.
