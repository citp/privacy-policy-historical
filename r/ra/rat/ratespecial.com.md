### Cookies

In addition to the personal information you provide to us, we collect certain information online and offline arising out of your use of our Site, including but not limited to the number and type of offers you have responded to and completed. When you visit our Site, we automatically tracks certain non personally identifiable information with respect to your behavior on the Site through the cookie we place in your browser. This non personally identifiable information may include the Internet address or URL that you just came from and the URL to which you go next; your computer browser information; and your IP address. We use this non personally identifiable information in conjunction with some of the information that you provided to conduct internal research on users’ demographics and behavior and to better understand how to serve users of the Site. The aforementioned information cannot, by itself, be used to gather any personally identifiable information about you, but it will allow us to track the overall effectiveness of our online advertising campaigns. Third parties may also set cookies on or through the service to track Site usage and to track the overall effectiveness of our online advertising campaigns.

We use both session cookies, which terminate when a user closes his/her browser, and persistent cookies, which remain on the user’s computer until manually deleted.

We do not tie server log files to personally identifiable information.

### Web Beacons

We may employ and certain Third Party Providers may employ a software technology called clear gifs (also known as Web Beacons or Web Bugs). Clear gifs help us better manage content through the service by informing us what content and which campaigns are effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics, about the size of a period at the end of a sentence, with a unique identifier. Clear gifs are similar in function to cookies and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In addition, we and certain Third Party Providers may use clear gifs in HTML-based emails. This allows us and the Third Party Provider to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of marketing campaigns by showing how many emails the recipients have opened. We do not tie clear gifs to personally identifiable information.

### How We Use Your Information

We may perform a preliminary validation of any information that you submit to Ratespecial and an evaluation of your qualifications for our Third Party Providers’ products and services.

### How We Protect Your Privacy

We protect your privacy in a number of ways. As an initial matter, any Financial Information transmitted to our servers via a secure server is encrypted using SSL technology. SSL is a protocol that transmits your communications over the Internet in an encrypted form. The protocol ensures that the information is sent, unchanged, only to the server you intended to send it to.

Once your Financial Information reaches our server, it is protected by a firewall. In addition to encryption and firewall protections, our Third Party Providers are required to operate in accordance with federal and state laws and regulations, including regulations relating to CAN-SPAM and rules promulgated by the FTC. If we learn that any of our Third Party Providers is breaching our agreement, we will take corrective actions including, if necessary, terminating our relationship with such Third Party Partner.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security or that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. For example, third parties may unlawfully intercept personal data or access our servers and obtain personal data. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, nor should you expect that your personal information would always remain private.
