In addition, users under the age of 13 are instructed not to use any personally
identifyable information in any public review or message board posting. Users
under 13 may fully participate in this web service if they receive permission from their parents,  and the parent(s) send an e-mail to sharifi@cc.gatech.edu  that states that they have read this privacy policy and give permission for
their child to use the service.  If a user under the age of 13 fills out a profile despite instructions not to, the information stored in the profile will be removed. 
<br><br>


<b>What information we collect:</b>

to share it by checking the box that says
