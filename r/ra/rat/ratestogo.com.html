			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
			<p>Effective 12 March 2014</p>
<p>HotelClub is committed to maintaining and ensuring your privacy.</p>
<p>HotelClub is bound by the Australian Privacy Principles (<strong>APPs</strong>), which are contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (<strong>Privacy Act</strong>). As part of our business operations we may collect your personal information. This Privacy Policy describes the type of personal information we may collect and how we use, store and disclose this personal information. If you have any questions regarding this privacy policy, please contact us using the details below.</p>
<p><strong>1. Definitions</strong></p>
<p>In this Privacy Policy, terms that commence with a capital letter are defined in this Section 1 or in the preamble. <br> <br> <strong>"Affiliates and Business Partners"</strong> means other companies who HotelClub is related to or contracts with. <br> <br> To <strong>"Book"</strong> means to reserve. <br> <br> <strong>"Cookie"</strong> means a small computer file that is sent from our web server to a Subscriber, Member or Guest's computer for the purpose of future identification of that computer on future visits to the Web Site. <br> <br> <strong>"Guest"</strong> means an individual who can search and book Products or Services on the Web Site without being a Member.</p>
<p><strong>"HotelClub”</strong>, <strong>“us”</strong>, <strong>“our”</strong>, or <strong>"we"</strong> means HotelClub Pty Ltd and its related bodies corporate. <br> <br> <strong>"Member"</strong> means an individual who has registered with the Web Site. Members have a Member ID and a password. <br> <br> <strong>"Member ID"</strong> means the e-mail address you use (with your password) to login to our Web Site. <br> <br> <strong>“Pixel Tag”</strong> means a tiny graphic with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and is used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.</p>
<p><strong>"Products or Services"</strong> means the hotel accommodation and any other items available from the Web Site. <br> <br> <strong>"Session Data"</strong> means usage information, such as the type of Internet browser and operating system an individual uses, the domain name of the web site from which the individual came, the date, time and duration of the visit, number of visits, average time spent on the Web Site, pages viewed, domain name of the individual and number of cookies accumulated. This information is anonymous and does not identify individual visitors to the site.<br> <br> <strong>"Subscriber"</strong> means an individual who elects to receive offers or promotions by email or otherwise from HotelClub without becoming a Member or a Guest. <br> <br> <strong>"User"</strong> means a Guest or Member. <br> <br> <strong>"Web Site"</strong> means the <a href="http://www.hotelclub.com/">www.RatesToGo.com</a> and its respective sub web sites together with the respective content, Products and Services available from this Web Site or sub Web Sites.</p>
<p><strong>2. The personal information we collect</strong></p>
<p>We collect personal information from you in the course of providing a Product or Service or when you have other dealings with us. We may also collect information about you in order for you to register as a Member, become a Subscriber, complete an online registration form, participate in a survey or competition, receive our customer services, ask a question or initiate a transaction on our website, over the phone, via email or via a mobile application.</p>
<p>For example, we may collect details including but not limited to your name, mailing address, telephone number, email address, date of birth, credit card number and expiry date, and details of your hotel and other travel details. We may also collect your personal information from others who make a booking on your behalf.</p>
<p>We collect your personal information if you submit a review on our Web Site. In doing so, you should be aware that any personal information you submit can be read, collected or used by other users. We are not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in reviews and such disclosure of personal information by you is strictly voluntary. If you wish to request the removal of your personal information from your review, you can do so by contacting us as indicated below in Contact Information. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p>
<p>You can visit certain areas of our Web Site without revealing who you are or signing-in. When you visit our Web Site as a Guest, Member or Subscriber, we collect Session Data through analytics tools, Cookies and Pixel Tags as discussed below.</p>
<p><strong>Analytics tools, Cookies and Pixel Tags</strong></p>
<p>We collect additional information about your interaction with the Web Site without identifying you as an individual. For example, we use technologies such as website analytics tools, cookies and pixel tags to collect Session Data for the purpose of helping us to recognize you when you visit our Web Site again and to help us customize your online experience. Unless a user specifically informs us of his/her identity (e.g. by registering with us), we will not know who the individual user is. <br> <br> Most Internet browsers automatically accept Cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting Cookies or prompt you before accepting a Cookie from the Web Sites you visit. <br> <br> If you decide not to accept our Cookies, you will be able to access those parts of our Web Site that are available to the general public, but you may not be able to access many of the Products and Services offered at our Web Site.</p>
<p>Additionally, we receive certain standard information that your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring Web site addresses. We also deliver advertisements and provide website analytics tools on non-HotelClub websites and services, and we collect information such as page views on these third party sites as well.</p>
<p>When you receive newsletters or promotional e-mails from HotelCub, we may use customised links or similar technologies to determine whether the e-mail has been opened and which links you click in order to provide you with more focused e-mail communications or other information.</p>
<p><strong>3. How we use personal information</strong></p>
<p>We use personal information to:</p>
<p>· provide you with the Products or Services;</p>
<p>· assist in arrangements and reservations with suppliers in relation to the provision of a Product or Service;</p>

<p>· facilitate your participation in our membership program;</p>
<p>· conduct competitions or promotions on behalf of HotelClub and selected third parties;</p>
<p>· develop, enhance, market, sell or provide our Products or Services, or those of companies with which we have a commercial relationship, but only if you have granted us permission to do so or we are otherwise able to do so under applicable law;</p>
<p>· perform all other administrative and operational tasks (including risk management, systems development and testing, staff training, and market or customer satisfaction research);</p>
<p>· verify your identity;</p>
<p>· communicate with you by email, mail or telephone;</p>

<p>· as otherwise permitted by law; or</p>
<p>· for any other purpose to which you consent.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Aggregated Information and Session Data</strong></p>
<p>We also use aggregated information (which is information recorded in any form about more than one individual) where the identity of the individual is not known and cannot be inferred from the information. We may use aggregated information to describe our User base to current or potential partners, investors and advertisers; after a survey, to understand and respond to market needs and preferences; or to make recommendations to other Users of our Web Site. For example, if Users of our Web Site who have travelled to a particular destination told us that they had positive experiences at a hotel in that destination, we might recommend that hotel.</p>
<p>We work with third parties to serve ads on our Web Site and to serve ads on sites owned or operated by other companies. Our ad servers, and those of our partners, use Cookies and Pixel Tags in order to anonymously identify your browser. Some third-party ad companies, such as ad networks, may combine anonymous information obtained in connection with activity on our Web Site with information obtained from other sources and/or sites. We do not use or share any personal information with any of our ad server partners, media partners or ad networks without your authorization.<br> <br> We use anonymous Session Data, such as the destination of your search, in order to advertise to you on our Web Site and for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. We do not sell your Session Data to any other party in connection with our ad programs but we may use it in order to run ads on behalf of others, such as travel suppliers. For example, we may serve a hotel’s ad to you while you are on another site, on behalf of that hotel. In such cases, we use a third-party called AppNexus to anonymously identify your browser while on another site. If you wish to opt-out of this kind of advertising, you can either delete cookies on your browser from adnx.com or you can click on the following link <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>. None of our ad programs include any of your personal information. By opting out of AppNexus you may still receive ads from HotelClub or ads from other parties that are broadly targeted (not on the basis of your Session Data).</p>
<p><strong>4. Our disclosure of personal information</strong></p>
<p>From time to time, we may disclose your personal information as follows:</p>
<p>· To suppliers of our Products or Services, such as hotels and accommodation service providers;</p>
<p>· To organizations that perform services for or on behalf of HotelClub, for example to provide customer service, process credit cards, submit e-mail communications to you on our behalf, for research, marketing, data processing, to measure the use of our Web Site, to facilitate usage by a User, or to offer credit card services or evaluate your creditworthiness. We will share with these companies only that personal information which they need to work on our behalf.</p>
<p>· To collaborate with other companies to offer you additional Products or Services, for example, through promotions. If you request these Products and Services, we will share personal information that is necessary for these other companies to provide the Products or Services that you have requested. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of your personal information by these other companies. We encourage you to read a company’s privacy policy before requesting any of its products or services;</p>
<p>· To protect our Web Site and our rights under our <a href="https://www.hotelclub.com/TermsOfUse.asp">Terms and Conditions of Use</a>;</p>
<p>· To protect the rights or property of HotelClub, including the enforcement of our agreements or polices governing your use of the Products or Services or where it is necessary to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit any damages that we may sustain;</p>
<p>· To effect a corporate transaction, in connection with the sale, merger, spin-off or other corporate reorganization of our corporation, where the information is provided to the new controlling entity in regular course of business; and</p>
<p>· To our insurers and to regulatory agencies.</p>
<p>We may disclose your personal information for a secondary purpose with your consent or if the disclosure is required by or authorised by law or a court/tribunal order.</p>
<p><strong>Cross-border disclosure of personal information</strong></p>
<p>Some of the third party service providers to whom we disclose your personal information may be located in the United States of America, the United Kingdom, the Philippines and India. Your personal information will be provided to these organizations only if they agree to use such information solely for the purpose of providing services to HotelClub, and under the instructions of HotelClub, and with respect to that information, to act in a manner consistent with the APPs, this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>
<p>Your personal information may also be disclosed to HotelClub’s related bodies corporate who are located in the United States of America, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Hong Kong, Singapore and China.

<p><strong>5. How we retain and store personal information</strong></p>
<p>We retain your personal information in our databases in accordance with our records management policy and applicable laws. This period may extend beyond the end of your relationship with us, but it will be only as long as it is necessary for us to fulfill the purposes for which your personal information was collected – this may include ensuring that we have sufficient information to respond to any issues that may arise later. For example, we may need or be required to retain information to allow you to obtain credit for a trip you Booked but had to cancel. We may also need to retain certain information to prevent fraudulent activity; to protect ourselves against liability, permit us to pursue available remedies or limit any damages that we may sustain; or where a law, regulation, rule or guideline requires it.</p>
