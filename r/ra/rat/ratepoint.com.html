    <p class="mbs">At RatePoint we value your privacy. Our primary purpose in collecting information about you is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient and customized experience and to provide services and features that are most likely to meet your needs.</p>
    <p class="mbs">Information We Automatically Collect. We automatically receive, store and track information collected via traditional web site analytics processes whenever you interact with the RatePoint Site or Services regardless of whether you are a registered User. Such information includes demographic information, browser type and additional non-personal information. We use this information to do internal research on our Users' demographics, interests and behaviors in order to better understand, protect and serve you and the RatePoint community. </p>
    <p class="mbs">Log Files. Like many websites, we automatically gather certain non-personal information about our Site and Services traffic and store it in log files. This information may include: Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and version, referring/exit pages, operating system and platform, date and time, and pages viewed or searched for. We use this information to analyze trends, and to administer the Site and Services. </p>
    <p class="mbs">Cookies. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a User's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on our Site and with our Services and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses the RatePoint Site or Services. In addition to some of the same information as gathered in the log files, the information we collect in the cookie may include a unique identifier for tracking your activity. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. </p>
    <p class="mbs">You may use the RatePoint Site or Services anonymously by prohibiting the use of cookies on your machine, however, your ability to use many features of our Site and Services will be limited. </p>
    <p class="mbs">We may use session cookies. A session cookie expires and is deleted from your computer when you close your browser. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Site and to receive the greatest benefit from our Site and Services. </p>

Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.
