**iv. Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms.** Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" signals to the websites with which the browser communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. There currently is disagreement, including among participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals. 

We currently do not take action in response to these signals, but, if and when a final standard is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals. Instead, as described above, please see the link to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising program that we follow that offers you choice regarding Information collected for online behavioral advertising purposes and the browser cookie controls and other mechanisms described in Sections 4(b)(i), (ii) and (iii).   
  
  


This Site and RMP may provide users and viewers with the opportunity to register for special Promotions, services, news, programming and information delivered via text messaging and other wireless devices such as mobile phones and, in the event we do so, users are required to provide their consent to receive such information from the Site and RMP, either by registering on the Site or via their wireless device. Such services and promotional opportunities are provided by the Parent Companies and/or Affiliates for the Site and RMP. The Information requested as part of the online registration process may include a user's telephone number or a wireless email address, but only if specifically requested, and the carrier's name. Additional Information may be requested for specific Promotions, such as a user's preferences regarding goods or services, choices of music or artists, or other similar survey information. Depending on the Promotion, we may also collect an Internet email address or other Information and, depending on the Information collected, the user may also be required to confirm his or her agreement to this Privacy Policy and 

[_**Terms of Use Agreement**_](https://web.archive.org/TermsOfUse_us.jsp)

. 

We caution that most wireless transmissions are not secured and there is a greater risk of an unknown third party's interception of messages or a user's Personal Information when using a wireless communications device.

Users that register for the Site's and/or RMP's wireless marketing services acknowledge, understand and agree that they will be charged by the user's wireless carrier for all messages sent to the user from the Site and/or RMP. Standard messaging rates will apply, unless noted otherwise. Under no circumstances will the Site, RMP, its Parent Companies, or Affiliates be responsible for any wireless email or text messaging charges incurred by a user or by a person that has access to a user's wireless device, telephone number, or email address.

*   a.

**Registration.** To the extent we provide wireless marketing services, there are two registration methods provided for the Site's wireless marketing services. Standard rate Promotions will be subject to either the "single opt-in" or the "double-opt-in" (Site/SMS) method, at the discretion of the Site depending on the type of Promotion. Premium rate services will require the "double opt-in" (Site/SMS or SMS/SMS) method.  
  
---|---  
*  
| 

**i. Single Opt-in Method:** In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted. The user's voluntary submission of the designated word or code to the Site and/or RMP will mean that the user has freely and affirmatively granted permission to the Site and/or RMP to send text messages to him or her. The Site and/or RMP will thank the user for his or her registration by sending a "Thank you" message. The user may terminate the service at any time by using the unsubscribe command in any text message from the Site or by sending a text message to the Site that says "STOP","END","CANCEL","REMOVE","UNSUBSCRIBE" or"QUIT".

  
  
*  
| 

**ii. Double Opt-in (Site/SMS) Method:** In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to this Site to start the registration process. The user must affirmatively consent to the Site's and RMP's sending of wireless messages to his or her designated wireless device by submitting a telephone number (or wireless email address, only if requested by the Site and/or RMP) and by clicking the consent statement on the Site's registration page. The user must also agree to the Site's Privacy Policy and [_**Terms of Use Agreement**_](https://web.archive.org/TermsOfUse_us.jsp) before the online registration process is completed. The Site and/or RMP will then send a "Confirmation" message to the user's designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from the Site and/or RMP to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate). The user must respond to the "Confirmation" message with a text message that states "YES" or "Y" that will indicate the user's acceptance of the Site's and RMP's wireless marketing service. Until the user responds to the "Confirmation" message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion. A user may respond to the "Confirmation" message at any time _provided that_ the Site and RMP may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user's response to the "Confirmation" is only valid if the response is received while the Site and/or RMP continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service.

  
  
*  
| 

**iii. Double Opt-in (SMS/SMS) Method:** In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted. The Site and/or RMP will then send a "Confirmation" message to the user's designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from the Site and RMP to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate). The user must respond to the "Confirmation" message with a text message that states "YES" or "Y" that will indicate the user's acceptance of the Site's and RMP's wireless marketing service. Until the user responds to the "Confirmation" message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion. A user may respond to the "Confirmation" message at any time provided that the Site and RMP may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user's response to the "Confirmation" is only valid if the response is received while the Site and/or RMP continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service.

  
  
*   b.

**Termination of Wireless Services by User.** Regardless of which one of the above opt-in methods was used to register, users may revoke their consent to receive messages from the Site and RMP by the following procedure:

A user may cancel one or more services via his or her wireless device at any time by using the unsubscribe mechanism provided by the Site and/or RMP at the time the message is sent,or by sending a text message that says "STOP","END","CANCEL","REMOVE","UNSUBSCRIBE" or "QUIT". The Site and RMP will terminate the user's registration for the most recent wireless service sent to the user. Any of these words followed by the word "ALL" in the user's termination request will cancel all of the user's registered wireless services with the Site and RMP. If the user unsubscribes from one or all of the Site's and RMP's service(s) via his or her wireless device, the service(s) will be terminated immediately and will cancel the user's previous opt-in.

**7.     ** | **Generally, you may review, update or delete certain Information collected by the Site, if you are a registered user of the Site and logged into the Site, by clicking "My Account" at the top of the Site and then selecting "Edit Personal Information". **

Generally, you may review, update or delete certain Information collected by the Site, if you are a registered user of the Site and logged into the Site, by clicking "My Account" at the top of the Site and then selecting "Edit Personal Information". However, Personal Information that is necessary to check eligibility, such as date of birth or age, cannot be deleted, but may be modified with sufficient verification of the correct information. We will allow you to change the password portion of your User ID, as well as certain other Information you have given us in order to keep your information current, but once you select a user name you will not be able to change that user name provided to us during registration and which is associated with your User ID.

Certain Information collected for certain entries into Promotions are subject to corporate and regulatory recordkeeping requirements and will not be deleted upon the user's request, unless the entrant is a child under the age of 13 years old.

If the burden or expense of providing access to your Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide access to such Information. In such cases, we will provide to you an explanation of why access cannot be provided and contact information for further inquiries.

**Children or Ineligible Teenagers.** If we, or our Parent Companies or Affiliates, inadvertently send an email or text message to a person that does not meet the age and other eligibility requirements of the Site, such as a child (a person under the age of 13) or others who do not meet the greater age requirements of certain features of this Site ("

 _Ineligible Teenagers_

"), the child (or Ineligible Teenager) or the child's (or Ineligible Teenager's) parent or legal guardian (the "Parent") always has the right to unsubscribe (opt-out) from receiving future emails or text messages via the unsubscribe mechanism contained in the email or message. The same unsubscribe process is available to a parent or legal guardian of a minor (a person under the age of 18, or the age of majority in your state).

In addition, Parents of children or Ineligible Teenagers who wish to terminate their child's or Ineligible Teenager's membership must use their child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID to gain direct access to the account, and follow the procedures in the "Deactivation/Termination of Your Registration or Use" Section of the 

[_**Terms of Use Agreement**_](https://web.archive.org/TermsOfUse_us.jsp)

to terminate their child's or Ineligible Teenager's member; alternatively, Parents may contact us via the 

[_**Contact Us**_](https://web.archive.org/ContactUs.jsp)

page and provide us with your child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID and request to terminate your child's or Ineligible Teenager's account and registration. We will not allow direct access to a user's account and Personal Information by any person without the user's User ID. If a Parent does not have his or her child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID, the Parent will be required to contact us via the 

[_**Contact Us**_](https://web.archive.org/ContactUs.jsp)

page and includes the Parent's name, address, telephone and email address, in addition to the child's or Ineligible Teenager's name and email address as registered on the Site, plus the child's or Ineligible Teenager's date of birth. The Parent must also provide verifiable identification that they are the parent or legal guardian of the child or Ineligible Teenager. The Site and/or RMP will send a confirming email to the Parent via the email address provided to verify that the Parent wishes to terminate his or her child's or Ineligible Teenager's account and registration. The Parent must then confirm by sending a reply email to the designated return address. The Site and/or RMP will then terminate the child's or Ineligible Teenager's account but will notify the child or Ineligible Teenager of the termination request via email and will identify the name, address and email address of the person making the request.
