### Privacy Policy

RateYourEscort is aware that you care how your personal information is used and shared. We are absolutely committed to preserving your privacy rights and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. Therefore, to the extent [RateYourEscort](https://web.archive.org/) (hereinafter "RateYourEscort") collects any information from you at all, we want you to fully understand and agree to what is done with it. We have tried to include a link to this policy on every page on which personal information is collected. And please remember, if you ever have any questions at all about privacy concerns, we invite you to contact us directly at: 

[admin@RateYourEscort](mailto:admin@RateYourEscort)

#### Use

This is an **Adult Site** that expressly and strictly limits its membership to adults. This Site does not seek or knowingly collect any personal information or data from persons under the age of 18 or under the age of majority in the jurisdiction you reside in and from which you access the Site. All such underage persons are strictly prohibited from accessing or viewing the contents on this Site without exception. If you are underage, your account will be terminated without notice or delay. 

#### Consent

By using this Site and/or volunteering information you are giving your express consent to the Site's Privacy Policy as outlined in this document. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this Site. 

#### What We Collect 

"Personally identifiable information" is information that can be used to identify or contact you, such as your name, e-mail address, home or work address, or telephone number. RateYourEscort only has access to the personally identifiable information that you provide to us. For example, we cannot determine your e-mail address unless you provide it. We cannot gain access to other information on your computer. Those who visit only public areas of the Site and who do not purchase goods or services do not need to, and generally do not, provide us with any personally identifiable information. Those who wish to join the Site, however, or to purchase products or services, sign up for our mailing list or contact us or any of our employees, agents or representatives, must provide us with enough information to enable us to process the requested transaction. This generally includes, at a minimum, personally identifiable information such as name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number. Members also select, and thereby provide, a username and password combination. Once you register and log in to the member area, you are no longer anonymous to us. We may also collect referring Website and browser information and other related data.

#### "Opt-In" & "Opt-Out"

Some offers found on this Site may be presented to you with the option to express your preference by either clicking or entering "accept" or "yes" or "decline" or "no". If you select "accept" or "yes" you are saying that you "Opt-In" to the offer and agree that your personal information and data may be disclosed to third parties. Other offers may be presented with a pre-selected preference of choice. If you do not deselect the pre-selected preference (i.e. "Opt-Out") then we may transfer your personal information to the third party making the offer. If you do deselect the preference then no personal information will be disclosed.

#### Protection of RateYourEscort and Others

We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; assist in fraud protection or investigation; or protect the rights, property, or security of RateYourEscort, our users, or others. RateYourEscort cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce laws. Therefore, in response to a verified and legitimate request by law enforcement or other government officials relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your name, city, state, telephone number, e-mail address and other information without a subpoena. Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and comply with our obligation as a good corporate citizen, we will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement or other government officials without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss, or report suspected illegal activity. 

Due to the existing regulatory and legal environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be required to disclose personal information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private. 

By providing your personal information to this Site, you are expressly consenting to the use and disclosure of your personal information by the Site for the purposes stated above and in the manner that it sees fit. 

#### Changes to this Policy

From time to time, this Site may use your information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our Privacy Policy. If our practices change, we will post the policy changes to this Site to notify you of these changes. It is your responsibility to review these changes. If you are concerned about how your information is used, please contact the Data Controller by e-mail at [admin@RateYourEscort](mailto:admin@RateYourEscort). Above all, you alone are responsible for keeping your information safe. Be careful and responsible whenever you access a WAP or Website.

#### Terms and Conditions of Membership

You must carefully read each of the terms and conditions of membership for this Site. By accepting membership to this Site, you are unconditionally accepting all of those terms and conditions. Some of those terms and conditions may also affect the right of this Site to use your information.
