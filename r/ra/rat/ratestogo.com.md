**Our commitment to data security**   
Your credit card details are protected while being transmitted over the Internet by the use of SSL encryption methods. Credit card details are only used to pay for accommodation booked through our service. These details are stored securely at all times, are not used for any other purpose and will never be provided to any unauthorised third parties.

Rates To Go has also obtained a digital certificate from THAWTE Server CA (part of the VeriSign group), an industry leader in the protection and management of data transmission and storage. You can view this site certificate on each secured page, by clicking on the THAWTE image in the top right hand corner of your screen. A small frame displaying site security information will pop up.

**The information we collect**   
When you make a booking via the Rates To Go web site, we need to collect information about you to process the transaction and fulfil your order. This information includes, but is not limited to, details such as your name, your contact details (email, phone, fax) and your credit card details. When you submit a request via our email support forms, we also collect your name and email so that we may respond to your request or query as quickly as possible.

**How we use the information**   
When you submit a booking request on Rates To Go, we use the collected information in several ways: 

  * Personal identification and verification
  * To complete your hotel reservation
  * To allow us to contact you for customer service, if required
  * To make improvements to the Rates To Go web site



In addition, your email address is collected to send you an email message confirming the reservation you transact online. You will occasionally receive updates from us about special rate offers, newsletters and any noteworthy changes to the website. However, you may always decline to receive these email messages. Please see our Opting Out policy described below.

Like most Web sites, there is certain information we automatically track, including the URL that you just came from, which URL you go to next, the browser you are using and your IP address. This data is utilised to improve the services of Rates To Go and does not include any personally identifying information. 

**Who we share your information with**   
We disclose your information to third parties (such as our hotels) only for the purpose of completing your transaction with us, providing the above services to you and for the purposes of associated administration. Rates To Go provides the guest's name, telephone number and e-mail address for each booking to the relevant accommodation supplier to enable them to process the booking efficiently and contact you if necessary. Some of these third parties may be located in countries outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). Your information will be provided to these organisations only if they agree to use such information solely for the purpose of providing services to Rates To Go, and under the instructions of Rates To Go, and with respect to that information, to act in a manner consistent with the relevant principles articulated in this policy. By submitting your personal data, you agree to the transfer, storing and processing of your data outside the EEA. We do not sell, rent or trade your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes. 

Unless otherwise prohibited by law or our contractual obligations, we may disclose personal information if required to do so by law, court order, or as requested by a governmental or law enforcement authority, or in the good faith belief that disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable. Such situations may include: to perform, maintain or enforce contracts with our customers; to protect the rights or properties of HotelClub, our business affiliates, our customers, or others; or when we have reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing, or who may be threatening to cause, interference with or damage to our rights or properties, whether intentionally or otherwise; or when anyone else could be harmed by such activities.

**Cookies**

Cookies can make the Web more useful by storing information about your preferences on a particular site. The use of cookies is an industry standard and many Web sites use them to provide useful features for you. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify you, only your computer.

**Opting Out Of Promotional Information**   
We at Rates To Go work hard to provide our clients with the best possible rates in all our hotels. From time to time, we will send our members newsletters, updates and specials for hotels in certain areas. You will only receive this correspondence if you have chosen to do so and we hope that you will find these items informative and useful.
