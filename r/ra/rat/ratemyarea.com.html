<h3>4. DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION TO OTHER PEOPLE</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 13pt;">
<strong>4.1</strong>

<p style="padding-left: 13pt;">
<strong>4.3</strong>
We will notify you when information about you may be provided to third parties in ways other than explained above, and you will have the option to prevent such information sharing at the time that we notify you.
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 13pt;">

We may make use of the personal data we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers' wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience but more importantly to help you receive more relevant information from businesses you might be interested in.
