            This Privacy Policy sets forth our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of certain information relating to your use of the Site. Your use of this Site signifies your understanding and acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy. <br>
            <br>
            This Privacy Policy is incorporated into, and part of, the <a href="terms.php">Terms and Conditions </a>, which govern your use of the Site in general.<br>
            <br>
            This Site is not intended for use by persons under the age of 15 years old. You must be 15 years old or older to provide any personal information to the Site, or to us through the Site. <br>
            <br>
            You represent and warrant that you are domiciled in the United States &amp; Canada . <br>
            <br>
            <strong> 1.&nbsp; Collecting Information:</strong><br>
            <br>
            <strong>
  Personally Identifiable Information</strong> <br>
  <br>
  The Site may request and collect certain personally identifiable information including, but not limited to, Application Data and other personal information contained in User Submissions, through various means such as online forms, online applications, e-mail and comments submitted to the Site. Such information collected through the Site may include financial information, health-related information, and other sensitive information.<br>
  <br>
  Other than as set forth in this Privacy Policy, and unless given permission by you to do so, we will not sell or disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties other than <em>our primary network of insurance agents or our third party network of insurance companies. <br>
  </em><br>
  <strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information </strong><br>
  <br>
  We may also collect certain non-personally identifiable information via the Site, such as Site usage activity and preferences, also known as demographic or profile data.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Why must you give so much personal information? </strong><br>
  <br>
  In order to provide the most accurate rate possible with NO surprises, we hate that too, Insurance companies establish their rates using a variety of criteria. Since we deal with hundreds of companies, we must ask you questions required by all of them to determine the most competitive match for you. Besides, you would never go to the doctor and when he asks “how ya feeling today or what hurts today ” respond with “Gee, Doc, why do you need to know that information!” Its simple , to recommend the best possible coverage for you, insurance carriers need to know some basic info on you or else they will prescribe the wrong medicine or treatment(ouch). <br>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>NOTICE OF CONSUMER REPORT PRACTICES <br>
<br>
</strong>In some cases, insurance companies may need to obtain additional background information about you. As an example Consumer reports may be ordered in connection with your insurance application.&nbsp; These reports provide information that may assist in determining your eligibility for insurance and the price you may be charged.&nbsp; Consumer reports may also be used for updates, renewals or extensions of this insurance.&nbsp; The insurance company may also obtain and use a credit-based insurance score based on information contained in your credit report. &nbsp;The insurance company may use a third party in connection with the development of the insurance score. <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Site Technology</strong> <br>
                <br>
                As with many Web sites, we may use "cookies" and/or other technology (e.g., web bugs, e-mail bugs, clear GIFs, web beacons and tracker GIFs) in the Site or in our communications with you to enhance the functionality of the Site and to make your transactions and other activities more convenient and efficient (collectively, "Tracking Technologies"). These technologies may vary, but in some cases may involve a small file stored locally on the computer used to access the Site, and may be used by us to store and collect information relating to your viewing and use of the Site and our correspondences with you.
