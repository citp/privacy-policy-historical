  * to the purchaser or seller (or prospective purchaser or seller) of any business or asset which we are (or are contemplating) selling or purchasing.



We will **not without your express consent** provide your personal information to any third parties for the purpose of direct marketing.

**4\. Control of your Personal Information**

When you register, or otherwise give us personal information, RavePad will not share that information with third parties without your permission, other than for the limited exceptions already listed. It will only be used for the purposes stated above.

**5\. Use of Cookies**

Cookies may be placed on your computer by RavePad, with your consent, for login purposes.

A cookie is a text file sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The text file is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser. We may send a cookie which may be stored on by your browser on your computer's hard drive. We may use the information we obtain from the cookie in the administration of this website, to improve the website's usability and for marketing purposes. We may also use that information to recognise your computer when you visit our website, and to personalise our website for you. Our advertisers may also send you cookies. Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies. (For example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookie by clicking "Tools", "Internet Options", "Privacy", and selecting "Block all cookies" using the sliding selector.) This will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites, including this one.

A cookie must be set to keep you logged into your account by holding account information that is essential for the login process.

**6\. Security of your Personal Information**

RavePad strictly protects the security of your personal information and honors your choices for its intended use. We carefully protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Of course, data transmission over the internet is inherently insecure, and we cannot guarantee the security of data sent over the internet.

Your personal information is never shared outside the company without your permission, except under conditions explained above.

Inside the company, data is stored in password-controlled servers with limited access. Your information may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country where RavePad, its subsidiaries, affiliates or agents are located.

**You also have a significant role** in protecting your information. No one can see or edit your personal information without knowing your username and password, so do not share these with others. **You are responsible for keeping your password confidential.** We will not ask you for your password.

**7\. International Data Transfers**

Information that we collect may be stored and processed in and transferred between any of the countries in which we operate in order to enable us to use the information in accordance with this privacy policy.

**8\. Your Rights**

You may instruct us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. In practice, you will usually either expressly agree in advance to our use of your personal data for marketing purposes, or we will provide you with an opportunity to opt-out of the use of your personal data for marketing purposes.

**9\. Third Party Websites**

The website contains links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies of third party websites.
