For example, we may share information regarding the daily number of unique users to our Site with potential business partners or others. Aggregated data does not contain any information that could be used to contact or identify you. For example, we may count the number of users who have made a review that belong to a particular postcode.</p>

		<h2>Cookies</h2>
		<p>We use a feature of Internet Web browsers called a "Cookie", which is a file that a Visitor's Web browser places on a Visitor's computer's hard drive, to assign an identification code to the computer and to collect and store Information. We associate the Information obtained about a User to the User's Personally Identifiable Information. We do not and cannot use Cookies to retrieve individual Personally Identifiable Information about Visitors from a Visitor's computer. Cookies do not contain any credit card information.
