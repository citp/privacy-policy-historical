If you choose to share any personal information with us, we may store it and use it for internal marketing research and other marketing purposes. We may, in the event that this information is collected as part of a warranty registration process, use this information to contact you later. If the information is sent as part of a website evaluation, we may also use the information to contact you about your comments.
