To make our services more useful to you, we use technological means to collect Personal Information from you, including domain names, your browser type, and your Internet Protocol (IP) address. You expressly consent to our collection of such information. 

An “IP address” is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer Internet access provider, your IP address probably varies from session to session. We track IP addresses to analyze our Web page flow.   
  
   
Use of Personal Information   
  
In general, Personal Information you provide to us is used to respond to requests that you make and to provide products and services to you. For example, we may use your Personal Information to process an employment application, should you submit one to us. We also use your personal information to send you electronic newsletters and promotional e-mails if you have requested to receive such communications from us (as described below). We also use Personal Information to provide you with updates to our services and to respond to your requests.  
  
   
Disclosure of Personal Information   
  
We do not generally sell, trade, rent, or share your Personal Information with third parties. However, we may share your Personal Information with third parties to fulfill your request for products or services or to deliver newsletters or promotional e-mails. These third parties are required not to use your Personal Information other than to provide the services requested by Ramco. You expressly consent to the sharing of your Personal Information with our contractors and third party service providers for the sole purpose of providing services to you. 

If you opt-in to receive communications from us (as described below), we will periodically send you free newsletters and e-mails that directly promote the use of our site or our products or services. If you would like to cease receiving these communications from us, you may unsubscribe by sending an email to [webmaster](mailto:webmaster@rsi.ramco.com)

Although we currently do not have a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, “affiliates”), we may in the future. We may share some or all of your Personal Information with these affiliates, in which case we will require our affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy. If our company or our assets are acquired by another company, that company will possess the Personal Information collected by us and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy. 

We may disclose your Personal Information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on Ramco; or (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Ramco or users of our website.

Security  
  
We use reasonable measures to maintain the security of your Personal Information.

Even though Ramco has taken significant steps to ensure that your Personal Data is not intercepted, accessed, used, or disclosed by unauthorized persons, you should know that Ramco cannot eliminate security risks associated with Personal Data.
