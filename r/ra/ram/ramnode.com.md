Protection of Personal Data

RamNode employs a variety of security measures to protect personal data from unauthorized access. However, no part of the Internet can be considered 100% secure.

Data Retention

Your data will be retained and processed as long as it is required to comply with applicable legal, tax, or accounting requirements.

At the end of the retention period, we will either delete or anonymize your data, unless it is stored in a backup archive and isolated from further processing.

RamNode will not delete any data required to comply with our legal obligations and financial requirements, or any data required to resolve disputes and enforce our legal agreements and policies.
