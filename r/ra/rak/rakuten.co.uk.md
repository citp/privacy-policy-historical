We may share this information with carefully selected and trusted third parties, including other Rakuten group companies and technical and other service providers to us. 

If you are a Buyer and engage in a transaction with a third party Merchant your email address, postal address and contact information may be shared with the Merchant for the purpose of completing the transaction. You will also receive transactional emails from the Merchant confirming the order, including dispatch or eventual refund, and follow-up invitations to leave feedback for the Merchant. 

During any contact with Merchants, we strongly encourage Buyers to ask questions before you disclose personal information which the Merchant may not have obtained during the process of the order. Merchants are prohibited from asking a buyer for their payment card details, bank details or other payment method details. If Merchants and Buyers share information directly, that information is not governed by this Privacy Policy.

If lawfully requested, we may also share information with law enforcement agencies and/or third parties in respect of information requests for criminal investigations and alleged illegal activities. 

Your information may also be transferred to another company in the event of sale of the whole or part of our business to a third party.
