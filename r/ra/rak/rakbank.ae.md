Once received by RAKBANK, only the bank’s approved personnel may open and process the application. Furthermore, auditing mechanisms have been put into place to further protect your information by identifying which employee(s) has accessed and in any way modified for example, updated or added to your personal information.

Unless restricted by applicable law, you agree that any and all personal information/data relating to you collected by RAKBANK from this website from time to time may be used and disclosed for such purposes and to such persons as may be authorised by RAKBANK.
