# Privacy Policy | Rasa Malaysia: Easy Asian Recipes

Rasa Malaysia is committed to maintaining the privacy and protection of your personal information. This privacy policy tells you about the information we collect on this website and how we use that information. By using the Rasa Malaysia website, you are consenting to the information collection and use practices described in this privacy policy, which may be modified from time to time by us.

 **Children Under 13**

We care about protecting the privacy of children. We won’t knowingly allow anyone under 13 to provide us any personally identifying information. Children should always get permission from their parents before sending any information about themselves (such as their names, email addresses, and phone numbers) over the Internet, to us or to anyone else. If you’re under 13, please do not provide us with any personally identifying information (such as your name, your email address or your phone number).

 **Information We Collect**

The information we gather falls into two categories:

  1. Information you supply when you register to receive emails or comment on the website, and
  2. Tracking information collected as you navigate through our site.



 **Personally Identifying Information**

In operating the Site, Rasa Malaysia may include registration, comment forms, online surveys, and other online forms that ask users to provide their names, e-mail addresses, and other contact information.

 **Tracking Information**

 **Cookies**

From time to time, we may use the standard “cookies” feature of major browser applications that allows us to store a small piece of data on your computer about your visit to our Web site. We do not set any personally identifiable information in cookies, nor do we employ any data capture mechanisms on our website other than cookies. Cookies help us learn which areas of our site are useful and which areas need improvement. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings on your browser. However, if you choose to disable this function, your experience at our Web site may be diminished and some features may not work as they were intended.

 **Click Tracking**

As is true of most websites, Rasa Malaysia gathers certain information automatically and stores it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the site, track users’ movements around the site and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Except as noted herein, we do not link this automatically-collected data to personal information.

 **IP Addresses**

Each user’s IP address is logged with each visit and each action performed on Rasa Malaysia. This information is never provided to the third parties, except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, and is logged only for a temporary period of time. IP address information is linked to personal information and may be used in an effort to block a “banned” user from accessing the Site.

 **Advertising**

If there is advertising on Rasa Malaysia, such advertising may employ the use of cookies or other methods to track hits and click-throughs. We are not responsible for advertiser cookies or how the information gathered through their use might be used.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please see: <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>
