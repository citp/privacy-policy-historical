##### Security

The security of your information is very important to us and we will only collect personally identifiable information to the extent deemed reasonably necessary to serve you in view of our legitimate business purposes as set out above. We use [Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology] to protect the security of your online order information.

While we implement these and other security measures on our sites, please note that 100% security is not always possible. You play a role in protecting your information as well. Because your password permits access to your personal information, please keep your password secret and do not disclose it to others.

Because we are a global company, the data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the United States. Data we collect may also be processed by staff operating outside the United States who work for us or for one of our suppliers or service providers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfillment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
