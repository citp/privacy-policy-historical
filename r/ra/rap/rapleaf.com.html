<p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Usernames </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"></span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">During registration, members must select a unique username that will be publicly tied to their use of our system.  We do not share usernames together with personally identifiable information (such as an email address) unless someone searches using a specific email address.  Searching an email address will display the username of a member if the email is linked to the member’s profile.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Passwords </span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"></span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">During registration, members must create a password. Passwords are used to secure member information and the integrity of the system. We only store a one-way encryption of member passwords which means passwords cannot be unencrypted by us. Our login page provides a way for members to obtain access to the system in case they lose or forget their password.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Changing Preferences</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Members may access and change their registration information using the ‘My Rapleaf’ link at top right of the page or when you first page that is displayed after signing in.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Members may change their password, username, name, and any other communication preferences as set by our system. Members may access other information collected and processed about them and adjust the display settings.  This includes the domain name of their email addresses on file as well other publicly available information</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Collection of Registration Information </span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Users of our system must complete a registration process (registration is a manual process). We will collect personally identifiable information during this process that includes email address (name is optional).  Registration information is kept private and secure and is not shared for marketing purposes.  We use this information to process registrations, contact our users, and to provide our services. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Optional Reputation Information </span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">After an account is activated, a member can choose to enter additional information, such as phone number(s), additional email accounts, or the URL of blogs or websites that are managed.  This information is completely voluntary and may be used to further establish a member’s reputation. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Adding Oneself to Rapleaf</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">A member cannot automatically be registered with Rapleaf.  The only exception to this rule is if a partner site integrates Rapleaf.  All members of the partner site could automatically be registered in Rapleaf using the email address and username at the partner site.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Also, someone can be included in the system as a non-member if searched by another member.  Rapleaf Team will leave an appropriate rating to the non-member as dictated by our reputation algorithm.  Note – this is process is not registering the searched user.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Collection of Ratings </span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Historical and statistical information are obtained from ratings submitted by members.  The ratings have a qualitative component in the form of comment/feedback, as well as a quantitative component as a score or point value. We will also aggregate historical, statistical, and other reputation information across all member accounts, and we store this information. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Ratings are collected, surveyed, evaluated and scored by the system to assess the quality of comment/feedback.  Along with our proprietary fraud system, we allow members to challenge comments made about them by emailing Rapleaf.  This challenge process promotes the development of the most accurate member reputations.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Our system uses a Rapleaf score/point system.  A point balance will be maintained for each member and non-member based upon the number and type of ratings on that particular individual. We may also use this information to add, adjust or discontinue certain services or functionality and to enforce our policies and procedures. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Members and non-members may receive ratings from Rapleaf Team from time to time.  These ratings will be based on actions that were performed with respect to the member/nonmember’s account.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Collection of Other Reputation Related Information</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">We are able to obtain and may display information on a person, email, or phone number from other sources that are at our discretion.  The system may automatically take into account this information in calculating the member’s reputation score or Rapleaf score.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Collection of Information Automatically </span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">We store information that we collect automatically through cookies, clear gifs and/or log files. We use this information to create a profile of our members’ browsing preferences. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Cookies </span></em></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Sharing Aggregate Information </span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">We aggregate statistical, historical and other similar information about our members and non-members and their use of our system.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Legal Requests</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Even though members are relatively anonymous while using our system, the improper or illegal use of our system may jeopardize that anonymity.
