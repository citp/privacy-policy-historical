<h1>
    Privacy Policy
</h1>
<p>
    Rapid7 is committed to respecting your privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of personally identifiable information you share with us (any information by which you can be identified, such as name, address, and telephone number). That is why Rapid7 has established this privacy policy, so that you can understand the care with which we intend to treat your information. Customers are very important to us and we want to know who you are, but not abuse the use of the information you give us. Most of the Rapid7 Web site can be visited without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. To protect your privacy, we have adopted the following principles:
</p>

<h3>
    Choice
</h3>
<p>
    There are times when we collect personal information from you. It is our intent to inform you before we do that and to tell you what we intend to do with the information. You will have the option to "opt out" of certain uses of the information. If you choose not to provide the information we request, you can still visit most of the Rapid7 web site, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services.
</p>

<h3>
    Accuracy and Security
</h3>
<p>
    We do our best to maintain the accuracy of personal information you supply to us and take appropriate steps to protect the information you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure.
</p>

<h3>
    Commitment
</h3>
<p>
    We are committed to privacy and will only use the information you provide us as you request. Mistakes are possible; miscommunication is possible. If you have any comments or questions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us by emailing the Webmaster. We will address any issue to the best of our abilities.
</p>
<p>
    Thank you for your support of these policies and of Rapid7.
