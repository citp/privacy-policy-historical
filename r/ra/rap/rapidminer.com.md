# Privacy Policy | RapidMiner

Hello, and thank you for your interest in RapidMiner Inc. and its affiliates (“RapidMiner”). This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, and delete your information. If you have any questions about this Policy, send us a note at [privacy@rapidminer.com](mailto:privacy@rapidminer.com).

RapidMiner collects information from multiple sources, including various websites hosted by or affiliated with RapidMiner (each a “Website” and collectively, the “Websites”) and various software products and services offered by RapidMiner (the “Software”). The Websites and the Software are referred to collectively in this Policy as the “Offerings”.

This Policy provides you with information concerning our practices and procedures as they relate specifically to information we collect via any Offering that incorporates this Policy. By using such Offering, you are accepting the practices described in this Policy. We may occasionally update this Policy to reflect changes in our practices. When we post modifications to this Policy, we will revise the “Last Revised” date at the bottom of this web page. The modified Policy will be effective immediately upon posting on the Website. Your continued use of the Offering after the posting of the modified Policy constitutes your agreement to abide and be bound by it. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Website prior to the change becoming effective and we will update the effective date accordingly. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. If you object to any modification, your sole recourse is to stop using the Offering.

We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Policy. You may, of course, decline to share certain Personal Information with RapidMiner, in which case RapidMiner may not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionality found on the Offerings.

## Information Collected by RapidMiner

RapidMiner collects information from multiple sources, including the various Offerings. Some of this information can be used to identify you or another identified or identifiable natural person or other data subject (“Personal Information”). Other information is aggregated, anonymized, or otherwise not immediately usable to identify you or another natural person or data subject (“Anonymous Information”).  Personal Information and Anonymous Information are collectively referred to as “Customer Information” in this Policy.

###  _What do RapidMiner Websites Store and Collect?_

We collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access our Websites and Offerings or open one of our HTML emails by using different types of technology, including “clear gifs” or “web beacons.” This “automatically collected” information may include Internet Protocol address (also known as “IP address”) or other device address or ID, web browser or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after visiting a Website, the pages you view on a Website, and the dates and times that you visit the Websites.

####  _Cookies and Web Beacons_

We use small text files called cookies to improve the overall Website experience. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user. Cookies generally do not permit us to personally identify you (except as provided below). We may also use clear GIFs (a.k.a. “Web beacons”) in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients.

This information is collected directly by the third party, and RapidMiner does not participate in that data transmission. Information collected by third parties in this manner is subject to that third party’s own data collection, use, and disclosure policies.

####  _Types of Cookies_

The Websites uses the following types of cookies.

##### Essential Cookies

Essential (or “Required”) cookies that are required for providing you with features or services that you have requested. Disabling these cookies may make certain features and services unavailable.

##### Functionality Cookies

Functional cookies are used to record your choices and settings regarding our Websites, maintain your preferences over time, and recognize you when you return to our Websites. These cookies help us to personalize our content for you, chat with you on the website, and show videos to you.

##### Performance and Analytics Cookies

Performance/Analytical cookies allow us to understand how visitors use our Websites by collecting information about the number of visitors to the Website, what pages visitors view on our Website and how long visitors are viewing pages on the Website. Performance and Analytical cookies also help us measure the performance of our advertising campaigns in order to help us improve our campaigns and the content for those who engage with our advertising.

##### Retargeting and Advertising Cookies

Retargeting and Advertising cookies collect data about your online activity and identify your interests so that we can provide advertising that we believe is relevant to you.

####  _Cookie Settings_

You can decide whether or not to accept cookies. One way you can do this is through your internet browser’s settings. Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies. You can also delete all cookies that are already on your computer. If you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site and some Website functionality might not work.

####  _Fulfillment Data_

If you choose to use a Website to purchase goods or services, we collect and process fulfillment data, some of which may be Personal Information. These are required individual details for the establishment, content or alteration of a contract. Which details are required depend on the goods or services you are procuring. The essential details can be identified by the asterisk (*). This includes – depending on the good or service – your name and e-mail address, billing information, company name, tax ID, address and telephone number, user name and password.

The Software may, from time to time, collect usage statistics on your use of and interaction with the Software, in order to further improve your experience with and learning of the Software and RapidMiner’s other products and services.

## Why RapidMiner Collects Information

RapidMiner uses the information we collect for the following purposes:

###  _Maintain & Improve Our Offerings_

We use your information to ensure the Offerings are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. For example, we continuously monitor our products to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.

And we use your information to make improvements to the Offerings – for example, to understand and analyze the usage trends of the Software to improve it and build better products. Or it may help us discover that it’s taking users too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.

###  _Develop New Offerings_

We use the information we collect in the Offerings to help us create new features and functionality.

###  _Provide Personalized Services_

We use the information we collect to customize the Software for you, including recommending specific next steps for you to take while using the product.

###  _Measure Performance_

We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our Offeringsare used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize website design, monitor and analyze the operation and effectiveness of the Website, and monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by RapidMiner. You can opt-out from Google Analytics by clicking [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

###  _Communicate with You_

We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may email you to let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to the Software; or regarding things you post on the  Offerings. And if you contact RapidMiner, we’ll keep a record of your request to help solve any issues you might be facing.

## Managing and Deleting Your Information

When you’re signed into your RapidMiner account, you can always review and update information by visiting your RapidMiner account profile.

### Removing Your Information

To delete all of your information, send an email to [privacy@rapidminer.com](mailto:privacy@rapidminer.com). Once we confirm your identity, we will immediately start the process of removing your data from the product and our systems. As with any deletion process, things like routine maintenance, unexpected outages, bugs, or failures in our protocols may cause delays in the processes and timeframes in connection with such removal.

There are other ways to control the information RapidMiner collects, including configuring your browser to indicate when RapidMiner has set a cookie in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember, as described above, the RapidMiner Offerings rely on cookies to function properly.

## Third Party Websites

The Offerings contain links to websites and services provided by third parties. Any Personal Information you provide on third party sites or services is provided directly to that third party and is subject to that third party’s policies governing privacy and security. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of third party sites or services to which links are displayed on the Offerings.
