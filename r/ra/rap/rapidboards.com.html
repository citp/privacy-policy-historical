<h3>Collection of Information</h3>
<p>
Most of the content and services on our site are available without our collection of any personal information from you. However, in some areas of the site we may request personal information from visitors such as name, home address, e-mail address, age, interests and gender. We may collect this information when you register for a newsletter, complete a survey, purchase a product, or inquire about our services.
</p>
<p>
In addition, some information may automatically be collected by our web servers as you browse our site. Our web server automatically collects information known as "clickstream data," such as the domain name of the service providing you with Internet access, the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet, your browser type and version, operating system and platform, the average time spent on our site, pages viewed, information searched for, access times and other relevant statistics. We also use cookies on our site. Cookies are pieces of information that a web site transfers to the hard drive of a visitor's computer for record-keeping purposes.

We also may use the information you provide to send you e-mail promotions and special offers from reputable third parties in whose products and services we think you may have an interest.
<br><br>
We use site generated data and cookies in the aggregate to measure the use of our site and to administer and improve our site. When we collect personal information, we may extract some of the information and combine it with other information, such as clickstream data. This combined information is used and analyzed only at an aggregate level to help us understand trends and patterns. None of this combined information is reviewed at an individual level.
<br><br>
To the extent required or permitted by law, we may also collect, use and disclose personal information in connection with security-related or law enforcement investigations or in the course of cooperating with authorities or complying with legal requirements. We may also use your information as permitted by law to perform credit checks, report or collect debts owed, or protect our rights or property, our website, or its users.
</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>
We take commercially reasonable precautions to keep all information obtained from our online visitors secure against unauthorized access and use and we periodically review our security measures.
