		<p>1. Information Collection
		Some information, such as the website that referred you to us, your IP address, type of browser used, and navigational information, may be collected automatically as part of the website's operation.

This information is important to us as it enables us to continue to provide services and information of interest to our visitors. Website visitor behaviour information is compiled in aggregate and does not represent individually identifiable information.</p>

		<p>On some occasions, such as when you request a website review, estimate for services, technical support, or when you subscribe to newsletters and email publications, we may ask for other information through online forms. The information may include your name, email address, postal address, telephone number, website URL and other personally identifying information. We may also ask other questions from time to time. Remember that providing information is always voluntary. You are free to decline to answer any questions or fill out any forms. By choosing to enter and submit the requested information when prompted, you are consenting to our collection and use of such information for the purpose of providing the services or products to you.</p>

		<p></p>3. Retention of Your Information
		Personal information will not be used or disclosed for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except with your consent or as required or permitted by law.
