It also addresses the export of personal data outside the EU and EEA. The GDPR aims primarily to give control to citizens and residents over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business by unifying the regulation within the EU.

Rapid Electronics Limited is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected and that we comply with the obligations of GDPR.

This Privacy Policy explains how we will treat any personal information that you provide us, details your rights and how you can access them and provides assurances on things we will not do.
