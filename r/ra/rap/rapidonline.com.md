The information we collect and how we use it

When you register on our website at www.rapidonline.com, we collect information about you and your organisation such as company name, address, job title, e-mail address and phone number.

We gather this information to allow us to process your registration and efficiently administer transactions and deliveries, as well as using it to develop and improve our services.

We may use aggregated information for the purposes of tracking the usage of our services and in order to help us develop and improve the website and such services.

We may have received personal information about you from other companies and organisations (for example, marketing purposes) and we rely on these third parties to obtain your consent for us to use this information.

We will only send marketing material or advertise the products and services of the company by email to subscribers whose contact details the company has obtained either in the course of a transaction or registration. All subscribers will be offered a means of opting out of such communications at the time their details were initially collected and each subsequent communication.
