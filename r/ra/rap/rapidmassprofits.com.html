           <p class="body-txt">We will never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized   third party. We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail   address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy   policy. </p>
           <p>How we gather information from users:<br>
               <br>
             How we collect and store information   depends on the page you are visiting. Like most Web sites, this website collects   information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be   transparent to our visitors. <br>
             For example, we may log the name of your   Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold   information from your visit.</p>
           <p><strong>What we do with the information we collect:</strong></p>
           <p>Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and   deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy and   do not share your information with anyone.<br>
               <br>
             Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify   you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about   your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help   enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or   what features are most attractive).<br>
  <br>
             We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on the website   to communicate with you about your registration; our privacy policy; services   and products offered by this website and other topics we think you might find of   interest. <br>
  <br>
             Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements: </p>
           <p>This website expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect the   privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties, including our   partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible through   our site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices.   For example, during your visit to our site you might click a link to, or view as   part of a frame, page, certain content that is actually created or hosted by a   third party. Also, through this website you may be introduced to, or be able to   access, information, Web sites, features offered by other parties. This website   is not responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. You should   check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing   information on a feature or page operated by a third party. </p>
           <p><strong>Children:</strong></p>
           <p>We  do not   knowingly collect or solicit Personally Identifiable Information from or about   children under 13. <br>
               <br>
             If we discover we have received any information from a child under 13 in   violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you   believe that we have any information from or about anyone under 13, please   contact us at the email address listed below. Only persons 18 years of age and older   and who qualify as Major emancipated persons in terms of the laws of their   country, may participate or purchase our products or receive our services. </p>
           <p>While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third   parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your   preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our   advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that enable the   advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before.   Other features available on our site may offer services operated by third   parties and may use cookies or other technology to gather information. We do not   control the use of this technology by third parties or the resulting   information, and we do not accept responsibility for any actions or policies of   such third parties. </p>
           <p>You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally   Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat or comment areas, that   information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third   parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other   individuals or third parties.
