        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Privacy is of great concern to most users of the Internet, and is a critical part of an enjoyable and 
            satisfactory user experience. We at GeoTrust are acutely aware of and sensitive to the privacy concerns of  
            our subscribers and other visitors to our Web site. Whether you are a customer of our various products and 
            services or a visitor to our site, we assure you that we do not collect personal information from you unless  
            you provide it to us. If you are enrolling for a GeoTrust digital certificate ("Digital Certificate"), you 
            may be asked to provide certain personal information. Please note, however, that we are asking for this  
            information for the limited purposes of creating your Digital Certificate, providing the services that 
            may be part of your Digital Certificate, and authenticating your identity in order to issue you a Digital  
            Certificate. You should be assured that we do not provide or sell personal information about our customers 
            or site visitors to 
            vendors that are not involved in the provision of GeoTrust's public certification and other services.

        <h2>Information We Gather from You</h2>
        <h2>Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
            There are two ways in which you may explicitly and intentionally provide us with and consent to our 
            collection of certain personal information:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>E-mail Request for Information or Registrations for Guides or Seminars - We use links throughout our site to 
                provide you with the opportunity to contact us via e-mail or live chat to ask questions, request information  
                and materials, register or sign up for guides or seminars, or provide comments and suggestions. You may also be 
                offered the opportunity to have one of our representatives contact you personally to provide additional information  
                about our products or services. To do so, we may request additional 
                personal information from you, such as your name and telephone number, to help us satisfy your request.</li>
            <li>Enrollment - If you choose to enroll for one of our products or services, we will request certain information 
                from you. Depending on the type of product or service that you request, you may be asked to provide different  
                personal information. For certain products and services, we may require your name, address, telephone number, 
                e-mail address, credit card number, bank account information, IP address, and/or social security number. Other  
                products and services may require different or supplemental information from you in order to apply. For a detailed 
                listing of the type of personal information requested for our various products, 
                please refer to the enrollment page for the particular product or service.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Under no circumstances do we collect any personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, health, or sex life.
        </p>
        <h2>Statistical Information About Your Visit</h2>
        <p>
            When you visit our site, our computers may automatically collect statistics about your visit. This information does not identify you personally, but rather identifies information about a visit to our site. We may monitor statistics such as how many people visit our site, the user's IP address, which pages people visit, from which domains our visitors come and which browsers people use. We use these statistics about your visit for aggregation purposes only. 
            These statistics are used to help us improve the performance of our Web site.
        </p>
        <h2>Use of Cookies</h2>
        <p>
            We only use "cookies" as described in this Section. A "cookie" is a piece of information 
            that our Web site sends to your browser, which then stores this information on your system.  
            If a cookie is used, our Web site will be able to "remember" information about you and your 
            preferences either until you exit your current browser window (if the cookie is temporary)  
            or until you disable or delete the cookie. Many users prefer to use cookies in order to help 
            them navigate a Web site as seamlessly as possible. You should be aware that cookies contain  
            no more information than you volunteer, and they are not able to "invade" your hard drive and 
            return to the sender personal or other 
            information from your computer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our uses of "cookies" are limited to the following specific situations. The first situation is with respect to temporary cookies. There are two instances in which we use temporary cookies. First, if you are accessing our services through one of our online applications our Web server may automatically send your browser a temporary cookie, which is used to help your browser navigate our site. The only information contained in these temporary cookies is a direction value that lets our software determine which page to show when you hit the back button in your browser. This bit of information is erased when you close your current browser window. If you come to our site from one of our business partners, our Web server may also send your browser a temporary cookie that reflects an "origination code" for that business partner. We use this information for statistical and marketing purposes. Second, if you log into an access-controlled section of our site, we may set a temporary session cookie to establish that you have been authenticated. The information contained in these cookies consists of random data that is used by the server to authenticate the browser requests to the server for that particular session. It does not include any type of personally identifiable information. This bit of information is erased when you close your current browser window. If you choose not to accept a temporary cookie, 
            you will not be able to log into or navigate in these online applications or use the Personal Trust Agent.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second situation in which we may use cookies is with respect to permanent cookies. 
            This type of cookie remains on your system, although you can always delete or disable it  
            through your browser preferences. There are two instances in which we use a permanent cookie. 
            First, when you visit our Web site and request documentation or a response from us. When you are  
            filling out a form you may be given the option of having our Web site deliver a cookie to your local 
            hard drive. You might choose to receive this type of cookie in order to save time in filling out forms  
            and/or revisiting our Web site. We only send this type of cookie to your browser when you have clicked 
            on the box labeled "Please remember my profile information" when submitting information or communicating  
            with us The second instance where we use a permanent cookie is where we track traffic patterns on our 
            site. Analysis of the collected information by our tracking technologies allows us to improve our web  
            site and the user experience. In both instances of a persistent cookie, if you choose not to accept the 
            cookie, you will still be able to use our Web site. Even if you choose to receive this type of cookie,  
            you can always set your browser to notify you when you receive any cookie, giving you the chance to 
            decide whether to accept it in each situation in which one is sent.
        </p>
        <h2>Use of Web Beacons</h2>
        <p>
            GeoTrust may use Web Beacons - also known as single pixel or clear GIFs - on its web site to 
            analyze traffic patterns such as the frequency of use of particular parts of the site. The data  
            collected helps us learn what information is of most interest to our customers and what offers 
            our customers would most like to see. If you do not want to assist GeoTrust in improving its Web site,  
            you can “opt-out” of this web site analysis by disabling JavaScript on your computer. If you 
            disable JavaScript, some of the features on our  
            web sites will not work. 
        </p>
        <p>
            GeoTrust may also use web beacons in promotional email messages to determine whether the message was 
            opened and acted on. We may use this information on email response to develop future  
            promotions you may enjoy. For these purposes, some of our Web beacons are tied to your e-mail address. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We use a third-party tracking service that uses cookies and Web beacons to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate to capture usage and volume statistic to 
            improve our site.  We have no access or control of these third party tracking technologies. 
        </p>
        <h2>Bulletin Boards, Chat Rooms and Forums</h2>
        <p>
            If you use a forum, bulletin board, chat room or other chat tool on this Web site, you should be 
            aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used  
            by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. GeoTrust is not 
            responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.  
            To request removal of your personal information from chat room or forum, 
            contact us at <a href="mailto:support@geotrust.com?subject=Privacy%20Statement">support@geotrust.com.</a>
            In some cases, we may not be able to remove your 
            personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
        </p>
        <p>
            You are also responsible for using these forums in a manner consistent with the "Rules of Engagement" 
            or other terms and conditions set forth on the relevant forum site.
        </p>
        <h2>How We Use and With Whom We Share the Personal Information We Gather</h2>
        <p>
            We assure you that the personal information we gather from you is used by us only as explained below.
        </p>
        <h2>Sending you responses and updates</h2>
        <p>
            We generally respond to any e-mail questions, requests for product or 
            service information, and other inquiries that we receive. We may also retain this  
            correspondence to improve our products, services, and Web site, and for other disclosed 
            purposes. Frequently we retain contact information so that we can send individuals  
            updates or other important information about our services and products. Occasionally 
            these updates or other important information may be sent out by third parties on our behalf.  
            Please be assured that any third party who contacts you in this capacity has executed a 
            confidentiality agreement with us that contains a provision ensuring the privacy and security  
            of any transferred information and limits the third party's use of the shared information to 
            sending updates or providing services on our behalf. Our parent company and its affiliated or  
            subsidiary companies may also send you information about their services and products. 
            In situations where you have supplied your information in connection with a question or request  
            for information about a product or service offered by a GeoTrust business partner, we may also 
            send the information you have supplied to the GeoTrust business partners that offer such products  
            or services. Please be assured that these GeoTrust business partners have agreed to ensure the 
            privacy and security of any transferred information and may only use the shared information to  
            send you information about products or services about which you asked. If you wish to unsubscribe from these 
            communications, please follow the instructions  
            included in each of their promotional emails. 
        </p>
        <h2>Facilitating the support, renewal, and purchase of our products and services</h2>
        <p>
            We may use the information you submit to contact you to discuss the support, renewal, and 
            purchase of our products and services. We may provide our parent company and its affiliated or  
            subsidiary companies with your information so that they may send you information about their 
            services and products. We may also provide the information you have submitted to us to a  
            GeoTrust subsidiary, business partner, or independent reseller (either within or outside the 
            United States) so that the subsidiary, business partner, or independent reseller can contact you  
            and facilitate the support, renewal, and purchase of GeoTrust products and services. You may 
            receive a communication directly from our parent, its affiliated or subsidiary companies, our  
            business partners, or independent resellers. Please be assured that our parent or any subsidiary, 
            business partner, or independent reseller who contacts you for one of these purposes has agreed  
            to use the information we supply only in accordance with a confidentiality agreement. To find 
            out the names and locations of the parent, its affiliated or  subsidiary companies, business  
            partners, and/or independent resellers to whom we have provided your information, please contact us at the address 
            given at the end of this Privacy Statement.
        </p>
        <h2>Facilitating the provision of certain included products and services (if you are applying 
            for certain types of Digital Certificates)</h2>
        <p>
            Certain types of Digital Certificates come with additional third-party services or products 
            that are included with the Digital Certificates. If you purchase one of these Digital Certificates,  
            we may forward some or all of the information in your application to third party providers so that 
            they can provide you with the service or product and follow up with you directly regarding their  
            service or product or an upgrade. Please be assured that we have agreements with these third-party 
            service or product providers that prevent them from disclosing the 
            information to other parties.
        </p>
        <h2>Validating your identity (if you are applying for certain types of Digital Certificates)</h2>
        <p>
            Certain types of Digital Certificates require that we compare some of the information in your application 
            to information contained in a third-party database or with some other third party source. We do this in order  
            to authenticate your identity and other attributes, and also to prevent identity theft. We have confidentiality 
            agreements in place with these third-party databases restricting the disclosure of your information.  
            In certain limited situations, we have contracts in place permitting the third-party database to disclose the 
            information to its subcontractors or affiliates, but only for authenticating your identity and only in  
            accordance with 
            confidentiality agreements.
        </p>
        <h2>Forming the contents of a Digital Certificate</h2>
        <p>
            The exact information that appears in our different types of Digital Certificates is set forth in the 
            relevant enrollment page and this Privacy Statement. Generally this information is limited to e-mail  
            address and name, but certain classes of Digital Certificates contain additional information. 
            For example, SSL Certificates may contain the organization's Dun and Bradstreet number. Please  
            note that all information that you provide us that forms the content of a Digital Certificate 
            will be "published." Publication of Digital Certificates in an accessible location (a repository)  
            is an integral part of enabling the widespread use of Digital Certificates. Your Digital Certificates 
            will be published in our repository so that a third party may access, review, and rely upon your  
            Digital Certificates. You should have no expectation of privacy regarding the 
            content of your Digital Certificates.
        </p>
        <h2>Disclosure by Law and Protection of GeoTrust and Others</h2>
        <p>
            If we are required by law to disclose certain information to local, state, federal, national or 
            international government or law enforcement authorities, we will do so (for example, we may  
            disclose the identity of purchasers of certain software products to the U.S. Department of 
            Commerce, Bureau of Export Administration, as required under the terms of our export licenses).  
            We will also disclose information to third parties as necessary in order to comply with applicable 
            laws and regulations. In addition, GeoTrust may share information in order to investigate, prevent,  
            or take action regarding illegal activities or 
            suspected fraud, or enforce or apply GeoTrust's agreements.
        </p>
        <h2>Business Transitions</h2>
        <p>
            Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, GeoTrust decides 
            to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses or business units in some countries. Such a  
            transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, 
            or the receipt of it from sellers. It is GeoTrust's practice to seek 
            appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.
        </p>
        <h2>Surveys</h2>
        <p>
            From time-to-time we may request information from customers via surveys. Participation in these surveys 
            is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  
            Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use of and satisfaction with 
            this Web site, and 
            improving our customer service and product offerings.
        </p>
        <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
        <p>
            If you click on a link to a third party site, including on an advertisement, you will leave the 
            GeoTrust site and go to the site you selected. Because we cannot control the activities of third  
            parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personally identifiable information 
            by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy practices as  
            GeoTrust. We encourage you to review the privacy statements of any other service provider from whom you 
            request services. If you visit a third party website that is linked to a GeoTrust site, you should  
            read that site’s privacy statement 
            before providing any personally identifiable information.
        </p>
        <h2>Your Ability to Opt-Out of Further Notifications</h2>
        <p>
            From time-to-time, we notify our subscribers of new products, announcements, upgrades and updates. 
            If you would like to opt-out of being notified, please contact us at the address given at the end of  
            this Privacy Statement or follow the unsubscribe 
            instructions included in each promotional communication.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you would like to change your preferences online, <a href="http://www.geotrust.com/compref/">please visit</a>. 
            If you receive a marketing communication from our parent, subsidiaries, business partners or  
            independent resellers, you should opt-out with that entity directly. Please be aware that 
            you may not opt out of receiving information regarding the security, initial use, expiration,  
            product enhancement or 
            migration of our Digital Certificates or other products or services.
        </p>
        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
            We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you 
            services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to 
            comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
        </p>
        <h2>Our Security Procedures</h2>
        <p>
            We consider the protection of all personal information we receive from our Web site 
            visitors and subscribers as critical to our corporate mission. Please be assured that we  
            have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of any 
            personal information we receive from you. As with any transmission over the Internet, however,  
            there is always some element of risk involved in sending personal information. In order to try to 
            minimize this risk, we encrypt all information that you submit in ordering one of our products or  
            services using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. Our security procedures are also subject 
            to at least an annual SAS-70 
            Type II audit by an internationally-recognized accounting firm.
        </p>
        <h2>How You Can Update or Correct Your Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
            If you need to update or  correct, information contained in a Digital 
            Certificate you will need to revoke your Digital Certificate and obtain a new one  
            because we digitally sign each subscriber's Digital Certificate as a part of the Digital 
            Certificate issuance process. If we were to subsequently modify or remove any information  
            listed in a Digital Certificate, our digital signature would not verify the Digital 
            Certificate's new content. Furthermore, if a subscriber (sender) then digitally signed a  
            message with his or her private key, a third party would not be able to properly verify 
            the sender's signature (created using the sender's private key) because the sender's Digital  
            Certificate would have been altered after the key pair's creation. For more information and 
            tutorials on digital signatures, Digital Certificate, keys, and related subjects, <a href="http://www.geotrust.com/resources/repository/">click here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you would like to update, correct, or delete any personal information in our records that is 
            not contained in your Digital Certificates, please contact us via e-mail at <a href="mailto:support@geotrust.com">support@geotrust.com</a>
            (for Class 1 
            and Class 2 Digital IDs) at or at the address given at the end of this Privacy Statement.
        </p>
        <h2>Certificate Revocation Lists</h2>
        <p>
            When a third party wants to rely on a Digital Certificate, it is important for the third party to 
            know its status (for example, whether it is valid, suspended (where available) or revoked).  
            The third party may do this by accessing our repository and querying for the status of the Digital 
            Certificate. We do not generally delete Digital Certificates (and their content) from our on-line  
            repository because a third party might not then be able to check its status. You may, however, 
            request to revoke (deactivate) your Digital Certificate. A revoked Digital Certificate will still  
            appear in our repository with an indication that it has been revoked. If you would like to request 
            to have your Digital Certificate revoked (deactivated) from our database, please contact us via  
            email at <a href="mailto:support@geotrust.com">support@geotrust.com</a>
            or at the address given at the end of this Privacy Statement. If you are 
            an Extended Validation SSL Certificate subscriber and would like to request to have your Extended  
            Validation Digital Certificate revoked, you may choose to visit 
            our site at <a href="http://www.geotrust.com/about/contact/extended-validation-revocation/">http://www.geotrust.com/about/contact/extended-validation-revocation/</a>
            and follow the listed instructions.
        </p>
        <h2>Email this Page</h2>
        <p>
            If you use GeoTrust's "Email this page" feature to send a copy of that page to someone else, 
            your email address will appear as the sender of the email. Both your email address and the 
            recipient's email address will not be used for any other purpose.
        </p>
        <h2>International Data Transfer</h2>
        <p>
            We maintain and process personal information in the United States. Accordingly, information 
            obtained elsewhere will be transferred to, maintained in, and processed in, and under the laws  
            of, the United States. By subscribing to one of our Services, you must consent to such 
            transfer and processing of your information in the United States.
        </p>
        <h2>Changes to this Privacy Statement</h2>
        <p>
            If a material change is made to this Privacy Statement and/or the way we use our customers' 
            personally identifiable information then we will post prominent notice of the nature of such  
            change on the first 
            page of this Privacy Statement and also on our home page.
