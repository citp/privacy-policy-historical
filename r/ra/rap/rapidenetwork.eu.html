<h2>IP addresses and cookies</h2>

<p>For the same reason, we may obtain information about your

<li>To recognise you when you return to Our Site.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on

cookies when you log on to or visit Our Site. Please note that our
advertisers may also use cookies, over which we have no
control.</p>
<h2>Where we store and process your personal data</h2>
<p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and
stored at, a destination inside or outside the European Economic
Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating inside or
outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such
staff may be engaged in, among other things, the provision of
support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to
this transfer, storing and/or processing. We will take all steps
reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely
and in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
<p>All information you provide to us via email or Our Site is
stored on our secure servers or the secure servers of third parties

responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not
to share your password with anyone.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet
is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect
your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data
transmitted to Our Site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once
we have received your information, we will use procedures and
security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>

<p>We may also use your data, and/or permit selected third parties
to use your data, to provide you with information about goods and
services which may be of interest to you and we and/or they may
contact you about these. We and/or any third party that we permit
to use your data, will only contact you by electronic means to
provide you with information about goods and services which may be
of interest to you if you have consented to this.</p>

by us about you. Your right of access can be exercised in
accordance with the Act. Any access request may be subject to a fee
of £10 to meet our costs in providing you with details of the

to date. You may ask us to correct or remove information you think
is inaccurate.</p>
