        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>Welcome to 
        the <a href="http://raptr.com">raptr.com</a> website run by Raptr, Inc.
        (<strong>"Raptr,"
        "we," "us,"</strong> or <strong>"our"</strong>). Raptr 
        is committed to respecting the privacy rights and concerns of all users 
        of our <a href="http://raptr.com">raptr.com</a> website (the <strong>"Site"</strong>) (we refer to 
        the Site and the services we provide as described in our Site collectively 
        as the <strong>"Raptr Features"</strong>). As such, we have established 
        and implemented this privacy statement to inform visitors to the Site 
        and users of the Raptr Features how we use and protect the information 
        we collect. If you have any questions regarding this information or 
        our privacy practices, please see the section entitled <strong>"Questions? 
        Contact Us"</strong> at the end of this privacy statement. This privacy 
        statement is effective as of 2/22/08.</p>

        <h3>What information does Raptr collect?</h3>
        <p>
          Raptr does not collect personally identifiable information unless 
          our visitors voluntarily provide it to us. We do, however, 
          collect certain types of information and ask for personal information 
          in certain circumstances, such as when you set up an account. The 
          following sections describe what type of information we collect, 
          when we collect it and how we use it.
        </p>

        <h3>Setting up an account</h3>
        <p>In order to use certain functionality of the Raptr Features, you will have to create 
        a user account which requires you to submit certain personal information. 
        When you register and create an account, we require you to provide us 
        your name and email address as well as a user name that you select. 
        We also ask for certain information about yourself such as your age, 
        birthdate, gender and interests. Upon activating an account, you will 
        select a user name and password. Your user name and password will be 
        used so you can securely access and maintain your account.</p>

        <h3>Viewing Web Pages</h3>
        <p>As with most web sites, your computer sends information that gets logged by a web 
        server when you browse our Site. This typically includes your computer's 
        IP address, operating system, browser name/version, the referring web 
        page, requested page, date/time, and sometimes a "cookie" 
        (which can be disabled using your browser preferences) to help the site 
        remember your last visit. If you are logged in, this information is 
        associated with your personal account. The information is also included 
        in anonymous statistics to allow us to understand how visitors use our 
        site.</p>

        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>We may from time to time implement "cookies" or other features to allow 
        us or third parties to collect or share information that will help us 
        improve our Site and the Raptr Features we offer, or help us offer new 
        services and features. A cookie is a small amount of data, that often 
        includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to a user's browser 
        from a Web server and stored on a user's computer hard drive. Usage 
        of a cookie is in no way linked to any personal information about you. 
        You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings 
        on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not 
        be able to use the full functionality of our Site or the Raptr Features</p>

        <h3>Viewing 
        and Downloading Content and Advertising</h3>
        <p>As with browsing 
        web pages, when you watch content and advertising or download games 
        and other software on our Site or through the Raptr Features, most of 
        the same information is sent to us (including, IP Address, operating 
        system, etc.); but, instead of page views, your computer sends us information 
        on the content, advertisement or game viewed or installed by the Raptr 
        Features and the website and time.  Additionally, the Raptr Features 
        allow us to collect information regarding the games you have installed 
        and uninstalled on your computer and what time you start and stop playing 
        a game.</p>
        <h3>Community 
        &amp; Support</h3>
        <p>We provide 
        customer service support through email and feedback forms.  In order 
        to provide customer support, we will ask for your email address. Aside 
        from this information, we do not ask for any personal information to 
        provide customer support. We only use information received from customer 
        support requests, including email addresses, for customer support services 
        and we do not transfer or share this information with any third parties.</p>

        <p>You can also 
        post questions and answer other user questions in our community forums. 
        Our forum and messaging services allow you to participate in our gaming 
        community; to do so, we maintain information, such as your user ID, 
        contact list, and status messages, including what game you are currently 
        playing (if you explicitly choose to enable this option). In addition, 
        these and similar services in the future may require us to maintain 
        your User ID and password. </p>
        <h3>Surveys</h3>
        <p>From time-to-time, 
        we request information from users via surveys. Participation in these 
        surveys is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether 
        or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include 
        contact information (such as your email address), and demographic information 
        (such as interests or age level). Survey information will be used for 
        purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of the 
        Raptr Features and will not be transferred to third parties. </p>
        <h3>How do we 
        use the information you provide us?</h3>
        <p>As stated above, 
        we use your personal information such as your name, user ID and email 
        address to maintain your user account. We also will use your email address 
        to contact you when we provide customer support and to inform you when 
        another user has sent you a private message or posted a comment for 
        you on the website.</p>
        <p>In addition, 
        from time to time, we may also use your email address to send you information 
        on updates to the Raptr Features, and unless you choose not to be included, 
        to alert you to offerings from other companies that we are affiliated 
        with. To opt out of receiving these emails, please see the section below 
        titled <strong>"How do you opt out?"</strong> We will not ever sell 
        your email address or send you offerings from companies that we are 
        not affiliated with. </p>
        <p>We may also 
        provide aggregated information about our visitors to outside parties 
        from time to time. For further details, please see the section below 
        titled <strong>"Does Raptr disclose the information it collects to outside 
        parties?"</strong></p>

        <p>We may use the information we collect to tailor your experience through the Raptr 
        Features by displaying content according to your interests and preferences, 
        providing a faster method for you to access your account and submit 
        information to us and allowing us to contact you, if necessary. </p>

        <h3>How does Raptr protect customer information?</h3>
        <p>We implement a variety of security measures to ensure the security of your personal 
        information on our systems. User personal information is contained behind 
        secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of employees 
        who have special access rights to such systems. We continue to store 
        your personal information for so long as it is necessary to provide 
        you our service and currently do not anticipate destroying old personal 
        information. In most cases, we will at a minimum keep one archival copy 
        of your information to allow us to comply with laws or respond to legal 
        processes.</p>

        <h3>Does Raptr disclose the information it collects from its visitors to outsideparties? </h3>
        <p>
          We will never sell or rent your email address or any of your personal information.  
          Unless we get your explicit approval in advance, we will only share 
          your personal information as we believe is necessary to:

            (this may include, without limitation, us authorizing such third parties 
            to email our users regarding updates, surveys and other inquiries regarding 
            their experience with the Raptr client and service); 
          </li>

            validate the size and composition of the gaming audience, and understand

            records showing which games were viewed by which IP addresses. 
          </li>
        </ul>

          information from anyone under the age of 13 nor is any part of our Site 
          or other Raptr Features directed to children under the age of 13. We 
          will close any accounts used exclusively by such children and will remove 
          and/or delete any personal information we believe was submitted by any

          <li>  
            Our Site uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, 
            Inc. ("Google").  Google Analytics uses cookies, which 
            are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze 
            how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about 
            your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted 
            to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will

            We, and third parties, may from time to time make software applications 
            and game downloads available for your use on or through the Raptr Features. 
            These applications may separately access, and allow a third party to 
            view, your identifiable information, such as your name, your user ID, 
            your computer's IP Address or other information such as what game you 
            are playing during any given session, and any cookies that you may previously 
            have installed or that were installed for you by a third party software 
            application or website. Additionally, these applications may ask you 
            to provide additional information directly to third parties. Third party 
            products or services provided through these applications are not owned

            In an attempt to provide increased value to our visitors, we may choose 
            various third party web sites to link to, and frame within, the Site. 
            We may also participate in co-branding and other relationships to offer 
            e-commerce and other services and features to our visitors. However, 
            even if the third party is affiliated with us, we have no control over 
            these linked sites, each of which has separate privacy and data collection

            Raptr Features and the links placed upon each of them and therefore 
            request any feedback on not only the Raptr Features, but for sites each
