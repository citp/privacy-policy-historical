Rank & Style will never sell, rent, or share your personal information, including your email address, to any third parties for marketing purposes without your explicit consent.

Like most other websites, Rank & Style might place or recognize cookies (small text files) on your browser in order to help us retrieve information vital to providing the best possible service. These cookies allow us to recognize you and simplify your user experience. Rank & Style will never use cookies to obtain any information from your computer not related to our site.

  8. Links to Third Party Sites; Affiliate Relationships  
Purchases made through third party retailers’ sites linked to our website are subject to the policies and procedures of those sites. Order fulfillment and customer service relating to orders placed at any of those third party sites, including the collection of applicable sales taxes, are the sole responsibility of such sites. Any concerns regarding order fulfillment, customer service, privacy policies or other issues relating to these third party retail sites should be directed to the administrator of the site.

Your online shopping can support Rank & Style. Rank & Style earns money on some of the products that we feature on our website through affiliate relationships with certain third party online retailers (through an affiliate network). These relationships enable our users to purchase merchandise featured on our site through these third party retailers’ sites. This in no way affects our opinions of the products that are featured on our site.

How do these relationships work?  
Rank & Style is part of an affiliate network that provides links to third party retailers that offer a wide variety of merchandise. Purchases made through these links may result in a portion of your total purchase being paid to Rank & Style as a commission. These funds are used to support our business. Rank & Style only receives a commission if you shop through one of the links on RankandStyle.com. Once you've entered the third party site, Rank & Style may (but does not always) receive a commission from the products you purchase during that visit.

Why shop through Rank & Style?  
The links provided on our website are specially coded to designate you as a supporter of our business. This is the only way to ensure that your purchase goes to supporting Rank & Style. 

  9. Security  
We take reasonable effort to protect your personal information that is stored on our database. Access to your personal information is limited to our authorized staff who need that information to perform their job functions.

  10. Amendments  
Rank & Style may make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time. In the event we do, we'll be sure to update these policies so please check back often if you are interested.
