## Rainforest Action Network's Privacy Policy

_August 17, 2007_

Rainforest Action Network (RAN) is committed to maintaining the privacy of those who visit [www.ran.org](http://www.ran.org/).

RAN is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. This information will not be sold or rented to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. RAN collects information from site visitors at several different points on this website.

We collect only the domain name, but not the e-mail address, of visitors to our Web site, aggregate information on what pages visitors access, information volunteered by the visitor (such as survey information, e-mail and other addresses), and other personal information.

The information we collect is used to improve the content of our Web site, to notify visitors about updates to our Web site, and alert visitors about issues and opportunities. The information is not shared with other organizations for commercial purposes. All personal information is stored on a secure server with password protection.  
Financial Transactions

To process a charitable contribution or product purchase, it is necessary for RAN to gather the visitor's name, email address, mailing address, phone, and credit card information. This data is used to verify identity and execute the financial transaction. Additionally, phone number and email address information may be used to contact visitors if there is a problem with the transaction.

RAN may use service providers (such as merchant banks and ecommerce integrators) for the express purpose of conducting financial transactions. Personal information is kept private and secure and is not sold, rented, or traded to third parties. It is important to note that credit card numbers are used only at the time of the transaction, and are not stored following the conclusion of the transaction unless a transaction is selected that occurs on a regular basis. For transactions that recur, credit card information is stored in an encrypted format.

Donations to Rainforest Action Network are refundable within 30 days upon written request. If you would like to have your donation refunded, please contact RAN’s Development Department.  
Electronic Newsletter

If a site visitor chooses to subscribe to any of our electronic newsletters through the sign-up forms on our site or while making a donation, RAN requests contact information such as name and email address.  
Action Center

RAN provides an advocacy service allowing site visitors to contact corporate leaders, key members in the business community and other members of the private sector on issues of concern. Contact information such as name and email address are requested. If cookies are enabled on a visitor's computer, then our site will use cookies to identify previous users of our advocacy service to enhance their experience.
