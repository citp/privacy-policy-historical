<h2><a name="faq"></a>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

<h3>How does RAND use personal information?</h3>

<p>Generally, RAND uses your personal information to operate the site and to deliver our services. For example, if you place an order for a RAND publication, RAND will ask for personal information needed to process your order, such as your address. RAND may provide other companies access to your personal information so that they can provide routine services, such as credit card processing or shipping your order(s).</p>

<h3>How does RAND use the demographic data you may provide?</h3>

<p>RAND may request demographic information or profile data when registering for an account, in online surveys or questionnaires. Provision of this information is strictly voluntary and is used to tailor our products or services to better meet the needs of those visiting our site. This demographic information is not shared with third parties except as required by law. From time to time, RAND may also collect demographic data as a component of our research undertakings. However, we will not gather such data without your knowledge or consent.</p>

<h3>Does RAND share personal information with other companies?</h3>

<p>RAND does not share your personal information except with partners who assist in providing services or products associated with the RAND sites. Without this relationship, RAND could not provide its service to you.

<p>RAND, our Internet Service Provider (ISP), and other service providers have taken every reasonable step to ensure that you have a safe experience online.

<p>When visitors come to our site, we collect and aggregate information indicating, among other things, which web pages were visited, the order in which they were visited, and which hyperlinks, if any, were "clicked" by the visitor. Collecting such information involves the logging of IP addresses, operating system (e.g., Windows or Macintosh), type of browser software (e.g., Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer), and Internet Service Providers (e.g., AOL or EarthLink) used by each visitor to the site. Although such information is not personally identifiable, it can be used to determine the IP address of the visitor's Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of his or her point of connectivity to the Internet.</p>
