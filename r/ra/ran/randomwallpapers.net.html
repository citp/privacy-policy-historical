        The owners and operators of RandomWallpapers.net take your online privacy seriously. This document outlines the types of information collected by our servers and provides links to the privacy policies of our third-party advertising partners.
        <br><br>
        <strong>User Accounts</strong>        
		<br>
            Membership is an optional part of the RandomWallpapers.net web site. No user account is required in order to browse or download the content we provide. However, creating an account enables extra features such as (but not limitted to) the ability to submit content, create a list of your own wallpapers, or post comments.
            <br><br>
            By creating an account, you are volunteering certain information about yourself that will be stored on our servers. This data includes at a minimum a username, password, and valid email address. Additional information may optionally be added by you to your account profile. Your profile information is public and may appear on our web site, with the exception of your email address and password.
          
		  <br><br>		 
          <strong>Personally Identified Data</strong>
            <br>

Furthermore, we request that minors and any individuals with limited decision making ability not create an account on this site without the approval and supervision of a guardian.
            <br><br>

            <br><br>
            <strong>Server Logs</strong>
            <br>
            Like most web sites, RandomWallpapers.net logs web-, database-, and other server-software usage and access information. This information may include your internet protocal (IP) address, which in many cases can be translated to an affiliation (such as your work, school, or internet service provider), or a geographical location. We only use this information for debugging purposes and for aggregating into anonymous usage and traffic statistics.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Cookies</strong>
            <br>

These files allow us to personalize the browsing experience for both registered and non-registered users. You are free to delete them at any time, or configure your browser not to create them. However, we do not promise that every feature of RandomWallpapers.net will function as expected without cookies enabled.
