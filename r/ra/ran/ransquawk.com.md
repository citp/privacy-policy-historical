# RANsquawk

At RANsquawk we are committed to ensuring the privacy of our customers. This privacy policy explains RANsquawk’s privacy practices, including those of our Website located at www.ransquawk..com (“Site”), for our customers who purchase our products and services. The Site is owned and operated by The JET Group Ltd. By using our Site and services, you consent to the terms of this privacy policy 

  1. ## What is Personal Information?

Personal information is information that specifically identifies an individual such as a customer’s name, address, telephone number, e–mail address, credit card or other account number, and information about that individual’s activities when directly linked to that person, such as information about his or her purchases. Personal information also includes demographic information such as date of birth, gender, geographic area and preferences when such information is linked to other personal information that identifies you. 

Personal information does not include “aggregate” information. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of products, services or customers, from which individual customer identities have been removed. In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service, but no personal information will be included in the resulting data. Likewise, information about the products you purchase may be collected and combined with information about the products purchased by others. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and customer needs so that we can better consider new products and services, and tailor existing products and services to customer desires. 

  2. ## What information do we collect and when?

You provide personal information to us in a number of ways when you visit our Site or use our service. For example, you provide us with personal information when you:
