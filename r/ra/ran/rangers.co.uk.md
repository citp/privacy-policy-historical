####  **12 Transferring Your Personal Data Internationally**

The personal data we collect may be transferred to and stored in countries outside of the UK and the European Economic Area. Some of these jurisdictions require different levels of protection in respect of personal data and, in certain instances, the laws in those countries may be less protective than the jurisdiction you are typically resident in. We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is only used in accordance with this privacy policy and applicable data protection laws and is respected and kept secure. Where we employ an organisation to process your data on our behalf we will put in place appropriate safeguards as required under data protection laws.  For further details please contact the Data Protection Officer using the details in section 3

####  **13 How Long Do We Keep Your Personal Data**

The duration for which we retain your personal data will differ depending on the type of information and the reason why we collected it from you. However, in some cases personal data may be retained on a long-term basis: for example, personal data that we need to retain for legal purposes will normally be retained in accordance with usual commercial practice and regulatory requirements.  Generally, where there is no legal requirement we retain all physical and electronic records for a period of [6] years after your last contract with us.  Exceptions to this rule are:

  * CCTV records which are held for no more than 28 days unless we need to preserve the records for the purpose of prevention and detection of crime;
  * Information that may be relevant to personal injury claims, or discrimination claims may be retained until the limitation period for those types of claims has expired. For personal injury or discrimination claims this can be an extended period as the limitation period might not start to run until a long time after the event.



It is important to ensure that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and up-to-date, and you should let us know if anything changes, for example if you change your phone number or email address
