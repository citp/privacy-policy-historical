This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Boomerang does not own or control, or to individuals that Boomerang does not employ or manage.

When you connect a third-party account, we receive and store information including your name, user name, email address, check-ins, and profile data. To help you give great, personalized gifts, we may also access data about your friends, including their “Likes” or where they have checked in.

When you purchase a paid gift, you will need to submit a credit card or other payment information (debit card, PayPal, etc.) so that our service providers can process your payment. All transactions are processed using industry-standard encryption and Boomerang never directly accesses or stores sensitive payment information.

#### Personal Information Collected Automatically

Boomerang automatically receives and stores information from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and browsing patterns. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer through your browser to recognize your browser and tell us how and when you visit pages on our site. Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie.

#### Will Boomerang Share My Personal Information With Other Parties?

We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone. We share your Personal Information only as described above and in this section.

Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control: We are affiliated with a variety of businesses and work closely with them. In certain situations, these businesses sell items to you through our Website and our emails. In other situations, Boomerang provides services or sells products jointly with affiliated businesses. You can easily recognize when an affiliated business is associated with a transaction, and it will be clear what Personal Information (if any) will be shared with that affiliated business should you choose to participate.

Agents: We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them. Unless we tell you differently, Boomerang’s agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.

Other Users: When you give a gift to someone through Boomerang, please be aware that we will disclose your real name and email address to the recipient.

Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Boomerang, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Boomerang goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Boomerang may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.

Boomerang endeavors to ensure that Personal Information is kept secure. However, Boomerang cannot guarantee the security of this information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time.

#### How Can I Change or Remove Information on Boomerang?

Your Settings page on Boomerang allows you to change Personal Information. In addition, Facebook provides privacy settings that allow you to restrict Boomerang’s access to your data.
