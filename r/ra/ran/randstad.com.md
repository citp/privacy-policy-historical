As mentioned on the list some of these Companies are located outside the European Economic Area. The data protection laws in these countries may not be as extensive as in the European Economic Area. Personal data may e.g. be transferred to a country outside the European Economic Area if this is necessary for the performance of a contract between a company and a data subject, or for actions to be carried out at the request of the data subject and which are necessary for the conclusion of a contract. As this is not always the case, you are therefore asked to consent to the access by and transfer of your personal data to the Companies for the purposes as listed below.
