Third party merchants "Presented by Rand McNally"

If you make a purchase from a merchant site with a link originating from the Rand McNally website or a merchant catalog or website "presented by" Rand McNally, the information you provide to that merchant, such as your credit card number and contact information, is provided to the merchant and not to Rand McNally. Providing this information to the merchant enables the transaction to take place. However, you should know that the merchant may, if you do not advise them to the contrary, share your name and postal and email addresses with third parties, including Rand McNally. You should also know that these merchants have their own privacy and data collection practices and are not covered by the Rand McNally Privacy Policy Statement.

Merchants on the Rand McNally website and those merchants, who send catalogs or host websites "presented by" Rand McNally, have separate privacy and data collection practices. We have no control over and therefore no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. For more information regarding merchants appearing on randmcnally.com or other merchants who send catalogs or host websites "presented by" Rand McNally and their privacy policies, please see the merchant's home page and click on their Information link or review the customer service section of any catalog you may receive from the merchant.

Merchants that have links on the Rand McNally website may collect personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of these merchants are not covered by the Rand McNally Privacy Policy Statement.

How do you know your information is secure?

When you see either a solid key icon or a locked padlock icon at the lower portion of your browser window, then your site is secured through Secure Sockets Layer. We use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving your information on our website. If you do not see one of these icons, please contact your Internet service provider. When we transfer and receive certain types of sensitive information, such as financial information, we will redirect you to a secure server and notify you through a pop-up screen on our website. 

We have appropriate security measures in place in our facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our website so you can feel comfortable and secure. 

Please note that e-mail is not encrypted and is not considered a secure means of transmitting credit card numbers.

Children's Privacy

Rand McNally does not seek to solicit information from anyone under the age of thirteen (a "Child"). If a Child submits information to us through any part of our website, and we know that the person submitting the information is a Child, we delete the information as soon as we discover it and do not use it for any purpose, nor do we disclose it to third parties. If your child has submitted personal information to us and you would like to request that such information be removed from our customer lists, you may contact us using the contact us information listed below, and we will honor your request.

While our Rand McNally Classroom product is for use specifically by students, any usage of the product is allowed only with a single, generic, school access password. We only count the number of users by school. No personal information is collected or stored by Rand McNally on student usage of the Classroom services.

  * unique identifier information (your customer number or password)
  * transaction information (dates on which you made purchases, amounts and types of purchases)

Changes to this Privacy Policy Statement

From time to time, we may use the information you provide us for new, unanticipated uses not previously addressed in our Privacy Policy Statement. If our information practices change at some time in the future, we will post the policy changes on the privacy page of our website to notify you of these changes, and the revised Privacy Policy Statement will apply to all of your personal information that we have on file, provided, however, that we will continue to honor any past requests not to share your information with third parties. You should check our website periodically for more information on how we use the data we collect.

If there is a material change in the manner we use data we collect, we will update this Privacy Policy Statement to reflect these changes.

Conflict in terms

It is our goal to make our privacy practices easy to understand. We have created this easy-to-read Privacy Policy Statement with that goal in mind. Some browsers utilize privacy enhancing technology to translate our Privacy Policy Statement into a computer readable format. The technology then requires that the computer format be translated back into human readable format for you to read. This translation back into human readable format is often referred to as a "Policy Summary". It is possible that through these translations, the Policy Summary may unintentionally end up being inconsistent with the Privacy Policy Statement upon which it is based. It might fail to address an issue or it might address an issue not raised in our Privacy Policy Statement. For this reason, you should rely on our Privacy Policy Statement as the most accurate and definitive description of our practices.
