about individuals except when such individuals specifically provide
such information on a voluntary basis. For example, such personally
identifiable information may be gathered from a contest or sweepstakes
registration, the registration process for subscription sites or
services and in connection with content submissions, community postings
(e.g., chat and forums), suggestions, voting/polling activities
and transactional areas. Personally identifiable information on
individual users will not be sold or otherwise transferred to unaffiliated
third parties without the approval of the user at the time of collection.
At such points of collection, the user will have the opportunity
to indicate whether he or she would like to "opt out"
of receiving promotional and/or marketing information about other
products, services and offerings from <i>RankFlex.com</i> and/or any
third parties. Further, notwithstanding any opt out of promotional
information by the user, <i>RankFlex.com</i> reserves the right to contact
a subscriber regarding account status, changes to the subscriber
agreement and other matters relevant to the underlying service and/or
the information collected.</p><p> <i>RankFlex.com</i> reserves the right to perform statistical analyses
of user behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest
in and use of the various areas of the site and to inform advertisers
of such information as well as the number of users that have been
exposed to or clicked on their advertising banners. <i>RankFlex.com</i> will provide only aggregated data from these analyses to third parties.
Also, users should be aware that <i>RankFlex.com</i> may sometimes permit
third parties to offer subscription and/or registration-based services
through a <i>RankFlex.com</i> site. <i>RankFlex.com</i> is not responsible
for any actions or policies of such third parties and users should
check the applicable privacy policy of such party when providing
personally identifiable information.</p><p> Additionally, users should be aware that when they voluntarily
disclose personally identifiable information (e.g., user name, e-mail
address) on the forums or in the chat areas of the <i>RankFlex.com</i> sites, that information, along with any substantive information
disclosed in the user's communication, can be collected and correlated
and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages
from other posters or third parties. Such activities are beyond
the control of <i>RankFlex.com</i>.</p><p> Users also should be aware that non-personal information and data
may be automatically collected through the standard operation of <i>RankFlex.com</i>'s internet servers or through the use of "cookies."
"Cookies" are small text files a web site can use to recognize
repeat users, facilitate the user's ongoing access to and use of
the site and allow a site to track usage behavior and compile aggregate
data that will allow content improvements and targeted advertising.
Cookies are not programs that come onto a user's system and damage
files. Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the
user that has no meaning outside the assigning site. Users should
be aware that <i>RankFlex.com</i> cannot control the use of cookies
or the resulting information by advertisers or third parties hosting
data for <i>RankFlex.com</i>. If a user does not want information collected
through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most
browsers that allows the user to deny or accept the cookie feature;
however, users should note that cookies may be necessary to provide
the user with certain features (e.g., customized delivery of information)
available on the <i>RankFlex.com</i> Site.</p><p> Upon request, <i>RankFlex.com</i> will allow any user to "opt
out" of further promotional contacts at any time. Additionally
upon request, <i>RankFlex.com</i> will use reasonable efforts to allow
users to update/correct personal information previously submitted
which the user states is erroneous to the extent such activities
will not compromise privacy or security interests. Also, upon a
user's request, <i>RankFlex.com</i> will use commercially reasonable
efforts to functionally delete the user and his or her personal
information from its database; however, it may be impossible to
delete a user's entry without some residual information because
of backups and records of deletions.</p><p> We provide links to other World Wide Web sites or resources.
We do not control these sites and resources, do not endorse them,
and are not responsible for any aspects of those sites, including
their availability, content, accuracy, legality or delivery of services.
You waive any claim resulting from your exposure to material on or
through <i>RankFlex.com</i> that is offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable.</p><p> The foregoing policies are effective as of October 12, 2009. <i>RankFlex.com</i> reserves the right to change this policy at any
time by notifying users of the existence of a new privacy statement.
This statement and the policies outlined herein are not intended
to and do not create any contractual or other legal rights in or
