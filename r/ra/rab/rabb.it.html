                <h3>Changing or Deleting Your Information</h3>
                <p>
                    Company does not have a mechanism for you to review, edit or delete any of your information on or stored in the Services or otherwise by Company. If in the future, the Company may implement a personal profile section of the Services which may allow you to review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in your registration or user profile, but Company has no obligation to provide or create such a section.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you would like us to delete your Personal Information in our system, please contact us and we will consider making good faith efforts to accommodate your request, though we have no obligation to do so (and will not do so if we have any legal obligation to retain the record or legitimate business need to retain such information). See below for privacy contact information. In such cases, we ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests because of the reasons stated above or because such requests are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, relate to information that is incorporated into other databases or Services as permitted by this Privacy Policy, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes or derivative information that is not separable), or for other reasons. Because of the way we maintain certain Services, after you delete your information, residual copies may take a period of time before they are deleted from our active servers and may remain in our backup systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If some or all of your information is deleted from your Facebook profile or (in the even one is created, in the Company’s user registration or profile section) your account may become deactivated, your right to use the Services may terminate and you may no longer be able to use the Services. We are not responsible for updating, correcting or removing any of your information disclosed to or held by third parties.

                <h3>Cookies and Other Files</h3>

We may use cookies or such other technologies to improve the quality of the Services, including for storing user preferences and tracking user trends and for any of the other purposes permitted in this Privacy Policy.

We may utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Services, to better understand how you interact with the Services and to monitor aggregate usage by Company users and web traffic routing on the Services. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are usually deleted from your computer when you log off from the Services and then close your browser. Third party advertisers on the Services may also place or read cookies on your browser.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page. When you use the Services, our servers may record certain information that your web browser or the Rabbit Application sends whenever you visit any website or utilize any other services or applications. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other information. When you use the Services, we may employ clear GIFs (also known as web beacons) or similar mechanisms which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously.

In this regard, we employ administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure and to safeguard your information against loss, theft, alteration and destruction. No method of security is 100% secure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored "personal data" (as defined in applicable statutes on security breach notification) to your via email or conspicuous posting on or through the Services in an expedient manner and without unreasonable delay, insofar as these are consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.
                </p>
