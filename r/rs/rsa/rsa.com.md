To protect the privacy of any personal information you may have provided, EMC employs Internet firewalls, intrusion detection, anti-virus protection, and network monitoring, and, where appropriate and required by applicable law, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or similarly encrypted browsers. If a password is used to help protect your accounts and personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential.

### Display of Advertising

EMC collects and/or logs Internet Protocol addresses, Internet domain names, the web browser and operating system used to access the EMC website, the files visited, the time spent in each file, and the time and date of each visit. EMC collects these through the use of log files and web beacons.

EMC also uses cookies on some of its websites. Cookies are identifiers that can be sent from a website via your browser to be placed on your computer's hard drive. Thereafter when you visit a website, a message is sent back to the web server by the browser accessing the website. You may elect not to accept cookies by changing the designated settings on your web browser. However, not utilizing cookies may prevent you from using certain functions and features of websites. The information collected from the use of cookies is used and analyzed to improve EMC's websites, such as by gaining a better understanding of your interests and requirements regarding our website. Cookies may be linked to your personal information, such as your email address or password. You can set your browser to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. The information we collect and analyze is used to improve our service to you and personalize your web-browsing experience.

For EMC.com, we use the services of a third party vendor to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use the site. To do this, we use Web beacons and cookies provided by this vendor on this site. The type of information we collect includes the pages visited, navigation patterns, etc. This information helps us learn things such as what product information is of most interest to our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. These third party tracking devices only collect data in the aggregate. Although the vendor logs the information coming from our site on our behalf, EMC controls how that data may and may not be used. If you do not want to assist EMC in improving our site, products, offers, and marketing strategy, you can opt-out of this website analysis tool by clicking here [http://ecn-analytics-nssl.emc.com/optout.html](http://ecn-analytics-nssl.emc.com/optout.html).

Websites of EMC subsidiaries or divisions may use similar tracking tools for similar internal business purposes only. These websites may not offer this opt-out functionality.

EMC.com utilizes framing techniques to make it appear that the user is still on the site when the user is actually on a third party website.

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about a page on EMC.com, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. EMC does not store this information.

### Links to Non-EMC Websites and Third Parties

The EMC websites may provide links to third-party websites for your convenience and information. If you access those links, you will leave the EMC website. EMC does not control those sites or their privacy practices, which may differ from EMC's. We do not endorse or make any representations about third party websites. The personal information you choose to give to unrelated third parties is not covered by the EMC Privacy Statement. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any company before submitting your personal information.

### Personal Information of our Customers' Clients

When we provide services to our customers, in some instances we process personal information about their clients ("Client Information") on their behalf. In these situations it is our customers rather than we who decide the reasons for which the Client Information will be processed. For details of how the Client Information will be used and protected, and details of how to access or correct the information, please refer to the privacy policy of the EMC customer to whom you submitted your personal information.
