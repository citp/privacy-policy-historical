# Web Site Privacy Policy and Consent to Use of Data RSA.COM - RSA, The Security Division of EMC

November 14, 2005

##### IMPORTANT: BY USING THE RSA.COM WEB SITE YOU GIVE YOUR CONSENT THAT ALL PERSONAL DATA THAT YOU SUBMIT MAY BE PROCESSED BY RSA SECURITY IN THE MANNER AND FOR THE PURPOSES DESCRIBED IN THE FOLLOWING PRIVACY POLICY.

##### Definitions

Rsa.com is owned and operated by RSA Security Inc. 

The terms "RSA Security", "we", "us", "our" and "ours" when used in this Privacy Policy means RSA Security Inc which includes all its parents, subsidiaries, divisions, branches, affiliates or companies under common ownership or control of RSA Security Inc.

The terms "you", "your" and "yours" when used in this Privacy Policy means any user of this Web Site. 

The term "Personal Data" refers to personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, birth date, e-mail address or mailing address. 

This Privacy Policy describes RSA Security’s current policies and practices with regard to Personal Data collected by RSA Security through www.rsa.com ("Web Site"). 

##### Notification of changes to this Policy

We are continually improving and adding new functionality and features to this Web Site and improving and adding to its existing products, services and programs. Because of these ongoing changes, changes in the law and the changing nature of technology, our data practices will change from time to time. If and when our data practices change, we will post the changes on this Web Site to notify you of the changes. We encourage you to check this page frequently. 

##### Collection of Personal Data including e-mail addresses

We collect the information you give us when you use our Web Site. You may use this Web Site to register to receive additional information or products from us. When you register, we ask you for contact information like your name, postal address and e-mail address. 

We sometimes supplement the information that you provide with information that is received from third parties. For instance, if inaccurate postal or zip codes are received, we will use third party software to fix them. 

##### RSA Security Email Marketing Communication Policy

RSA Security sends promotional email only to:

  * our customers 
  * people who have given consent to RSA Security to receive promotional email 
  * people on rented email lists who have given permission to the list owner to receive third-party promotional email 
  * people who have not opted out after having received promotional email from us. 



RSA Security employs a third-party email marketing platform that helps to ensure that we provide relevant information and services to the people on the mailing list. The marketing platform:

  * offers a central location for people to opt-out of RSA Security promotional mailings 
  * tracks which promotional emails are delivered, opened and responded to and whether respondents subsequently visit the RSA Security web site 



In each promotional email, we provide an easy and clear way to opt out of future RSA Security email. Opt-out requests using the opt-out link in our emails are processed automatically and go into effect immediately. Opt-out requests sent by email are processed within 10 business days.

When sending email to rented email lists, we suppress addresses of those people who have opted out of RSA Security email in the past.

We always disclose our identity in mass email communications, including the address of our headquarters location, and we always identify our mass, promotional email as advertisements.

We never use deceiving header information or subject lines.

We never send mass, promotional email to email addresses “harvested” from websites.

We never, under any circumstances, rent or sell email addresses to any other company or individual.

When capturing email addresses via our Web forms, we always provide the opportunity to opt out of promotional email.

When coordinating with our resellers for the purpose of follow-up on sales inquiries made to us, we provide full contact information of the inquirer to the reseller, including email address, so the reseller can follow up on the inquiry.

Our marketing email policy and practice fully conforms to the United States Federal “CAN SPAM” act that went in to effect on January 1, 2004. Note that some regions such as the European Union, have different email laws and guidelines, and RSA Security conforms to local laws in those cases. We welcome and encourage your thoughts on this policy at [mveit@rsa.com](mailto:mveit@rsa.com). To be removed from our email list, [please click here](https://web.archive.org/node.aspx?id=1060).

Personal Data may occasionally be transferred to third parties who act for or on behalf of RSA Security, or in connection with the business of RSA Security for further processing in accordance with the purposes for which the data was originally collected or for purposes to which you have subsequently consented. For example, sometimes a third party may have access to your Personal Data in order to handle our mailings on our behalf.

  
We may share or transfer the information in our databases to comply with a legal requirement, for the administration of justice, to protect your vital interests, to protect the security or integrity of our databases or this Web Site, to take precautions against legal liability, or in the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganisation, dissolution or similar event.   
Where appropriate, before disclosing Personal Data to a third party, we contractually require the third party to take adequate precautions to protect that data. 

##### Data Integrity and Security

We strive to maintain the reliability, accuracy, completeness and currency of Personal Data in our databases and to protect the privacy and security of our databases. We keep your Personal Data only for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or to comply with any applicable legal or ethical reporting or document retention requirements. 

Our servers and our databases are protected by industry standard security technology, such as industry standard firewalls and password protection. 

Sometimes we process sensitive data that requires industry standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encrypted browsers. We use 128-bit encryption to protect transmissions over the Internet. 

The employees who have access to Personal Data have been trained to handle such data properly and in accordance with our security protocols and strict standards of confidentiality. Although we cannot guarantee against any loss, misuse, unauthorised disclosure, alteration or destruction of data, we try to prevent such unfortunate occurrences.

#####   
Anonymous data collected through this Web Site

In addition to the information we collect as described above, we use technology to collect anonymous information about the use of our Web Site. This technology does not identify you personally, it simply enables us to compile statistics about our visitors and their use of our Web Site. 

We use this anonymous data to improve the content and functionality of this Web Site and our e-mail updates, to better understand our customers and markets, and to improve our products and services.

##### Cookies

In order to collect the anonymous data described in the preceding paragraph, we may use "cookies" that collect the first level domain name of the user (for example, if your e-mail address is "john@bigmail.com," the cookie collects the "bigmail.com" portion of your e-mail address) and the date and time you accessed this Web Site. 

Web beacons, also known as clear gif technology, or action tags, may be used to assist in delivering the cookie on our site. This technology is a tool we use to compile aggregated statistics about rsa.com Web site usage, such as how many visitors clicked on key elements (such as links or graphics) on a rsa.com Web page. 

We also use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web Site. An IP address is a numeric code that identifies your computer on a network, or in this case, the Internet. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information, such as determining how many of our visitors are from outside of the US. 

We may also perform IP lookups to determine which domain you are coming from (i.e: aol.com, yourcompany.com) to more accurately gauge our users' demographics. 

##### Children

We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children or minors. If you are a child or minor, please do not give us any Personal Data. If you have reason to believe that a child has provided us with their Personal Data, please contact us at the address given below and we will endeavour to delete that information from our databases.

Of course, the Internet is made up of a large number of international connections. If you are visiting this Web Site from a country other than the country in which our server is located (currently, the United States of America), the various communications will necessarily result in the transfer of information across international boundaries.
