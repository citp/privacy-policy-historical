# Privacy Statement

**UPDATED** : FEBRUARY 25, 2019 

This Privacy Statement applies to RSA Security LLC (“RSA” “we,” “us,” or “our”) to explain how information you provide to us is used and shared. RSA is part of the Dell Technologies group of companies (“[Corporate Affiliates](https://i.dell.com/sites/doccontent/legal/terms-conditions/en/Documents/Dell-Technologies-List-for-Privacy-Statement-May-2018.pdf)”). Our privacy practices set forth here reflect RSA’s activity as a data controller.  This Privacy Statement applies only to RSA’s websites (our “Websites”) and does not apply to any other Corporate Affiliates that have published their own privacy and security statements or Business Partners (as defined below); or to any other third parties, even if links to their websites are on our Websites. We recommend that you review the privacy statements of the other parties with whom you interact.

For purposes of this Privacy Statement, “Business Partners” means subcontractors, vendors or other entities with whom we have ongoing business relationships to provide products, services or information. “Personal Information” means information that can identify you, such as your name, telephone number, email address, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address and location data.

**THE INFORMATION WE AUTOMATICALLY COLLECT**

We may automatically collect behavioral and usage information about your visits to our Website, including the pages you view, the links and advertisements you click, search terms you enter, and other actions you take in connection with our website and services. We may also collect certain information from the browser you use to come to our website, such as your IP address, device identifier, location data, browser type and language, access times, the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of the website that referred you to our website and the URL to which you browse away from our site if you click on a link on our site.

In order to offer you a more consistent and personalized experience in your interactions with RSA, information collected through one source may be combined with information RSA obtains through other sources. This may include information that allows us to identify you across multiple devices through which you access our websites. We may also supplement the information we collect with information obtained from other parties, including our Business Partners and other third parties. Examples of how we may use this information include using your data to help us improve your experience using our website, to present you with options tailored to your preferences and for targeted advertising purposes as explained below. For more information on the use of cookies and other similar tracking technologies including how to opt out please see “How We And Our Partners Use Cookies.” 

Some RSA services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company.

If you have any questions or concerns about how such information is handled or would like to exercise your rights, you should in the first instance contact the person or entity (i.e the data controller) who has contracted with RSA to use the RSA service to host or process this information (e.g. your employer or service provider). They control the personal information in these cases and determine the security settings within the account, its access controls and credentials. We will provide assistance to our customers to address any concerns that you may have, in accordance with the terms of our contract with them.

If RSA is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Website of any change in ownership or uses of your Personal Information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personal Information.

* * *

**HOW WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

We may share Personal Information with Corporate Affiliates to carry out transactions you request, to make our business or that of our Corporate Affiliates more responsive to your needs, including so that our Corporate Affiliates may provide you with information about those Corporate Affiliates’ products and services, or for research or analysis. We may also disclose Personal Information in connection with legal orders from law enforcement or other government bodies; as required by law or regulation; to protect the rights of RSA, its customers, the public, or others; to combat fraud or criminal activity; or with your consent.

In addition, we may share Personal Information to carry out transactions you request with Business Partners that help RSA or our Corporate Affiliates customize, analyze and/or improve our communication or relationship with you.

  * To comply with **a contractual obligation** (for example, using your shipment details to make delivery where you have bought a product from us or using your personal details where you have asked us to do something before making a purchase, such as providing you with a quote).  We will advise you upon collection whether the provision of your Personal Information is mandatory and of the possible consequences if you do not provide us with your information.
  * For compliance with RSA’s **legal obligations** where other laws require the processing of your Personal Information (for example, health and safety, taxation and anti-money laundering laws) or where we need your personal information to protect your **vital interests** or those of another person. 
  * RSA’s (and its Business Partners’) **legitimate interests** which include the provision of this website and/or relevant products and services, and/or the carrying out of marketing and profiling activities, provided always that our legitimate interests are not outweighed by any prejudice or harm your rights and freedoms.

* * *

**RETENTION OF YOUR DATA**

* * *

**COLLECTION AND USE OF CHILDREN’S PERSONAL INFORMATION**

RSA takes children’s privacy seriously. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children through our Website. If you are a child as understood by laws of your country, please do not submit any Personal Information through our Website without the express consent and participation of a parent or guardian.

* * *

**HOW WE AND OUR PARTNERS USE COOKIES**

Our Website uses “cookies” to enable you to sign in to our services and to help personalize your online experience. These technologies and the information collected about you may be used to track your activity across multiple devices. Where appropriate, we use cookies to store your preferences and other information on your computer in order to save you time by eliminating the need to enter the same information repeatedly.

A cookie is a piece of text that is placed on your computer’s hard drive. Depending on the settings you have selected, your browser adds the text to your device as a small file. Many browsers are set to accept cookies by default.  You have the ability to accept or decline cookies as you prefer.  The Help portion of your web browser, most likely found on the toolbar, typically tells you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Note that disabling or declining cookies may prevent the use of certain features of our website, including the ability to login to a site. 

* * *

**ANALYTICS / LOG FILES**

As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may link this automatically-collected data to Personal Information in order to personalize our communications with you.

* * *

**TARGETED DISPLAY ADVERTISING BY RSA AND OTHERS**

RSA also works with third party advertising and personalization partners that use cookies and Internet browsing to help us display personalized content and appropriate advertising during your visits to our Website and other websites. For example, if you view a product on our Website, you may see offers for similar products on other websites you visit.  Cookies placed by our third party partners also assist us with measuring the performance of our advertising campaigns, the links and ads you click on, other actions you take on those web pages, and the site from which you came before arriving at a web page. These cookies can be effective whether you are on RSA.com or another website. If you opt out of receiving targeted display advertising, the data associated with these cookies will not be used.

These cookies assist the third parties in identifying the pages you view, the links and ads you click on, other actions you take on those web pages, and the site from which you came before arriving at a web page.

To enable you to opt-out of interest-based advertising delivered by partners working with RSA, or to customize your experience on our Website, please navigate to the main page and select “Cookie Consent” at the bottom of the page. If you opt-out, you may still see RSA ads on our Website and other websites, but those ads will not be customized to you by RSA or our partners.

* * *

**“DO NOT TRACK” SIGNALS**

Please note that while you may have the opportunity to opt-out of targeted advertising through the RSA Manage Cookies webpage and you may be able to control the use of cookies through your web browser as described in the “How We and Our Partners Use Cookies” section above, some web browsers may also give you the ability to enable a “do not track” setting. This setting sends a special signal to the websites you encounter while web browsing. This “do not track” signal is different from disabling certain forms of tracking by declining cookies in your browser settings, as browsers with the “do not track” setting enabled still have the ability to accept cookies.  RSA does not respond to web browser “do not track” signals at this time. 

* * *

**TARGETED EMAIL MARKETING BY RSA**

Some marketing you receive, including email marketing, may also be personalized based on your visits to our Website and your browsing and purchase history. In addition, when you click on some links in email marketing you receive, our email service provider may place a cookie on your browser. This cookie would be linked to your email address and used to gather information about the products and services you view on our Website. Information gathered may be used to personalize and customize future email marketing messages you receive. You may opt out of this use by clicking on the unsubscribe link provided in every personalized email marketing message you receive sent from or on behalf of RSA.

* * *

**HOW WE AND OUR PARTNERS USE WEB BEACONS, PIXEL TAGS AND TRACKING TECHNOLOGY**

RSA or its Business Partners may use web beacons on our website, in our email messages, in our advertisements on other websites, or in our advertisements in others’ email messages. Similarly, third parties whose content or ads appear on our Website, may also place web beacons in their ads or emails for purposes of measuring the effectiveness of the content, ads or email messages.

A web beacon is an electronic image that can be used to recognize a cookie on your computer when you view a web page or email message. Web beacons help us measure the effectiveness of our Website and our advertising in various ways. For example, web beacons may count the number of individuals who visit our Website from a particular advertisement, or who make a purchase from our Website after viewing a particular advertisement, or they may tell us when a web page is viewed and provide a description of the page where the web beacon is placed. Web beacons may also measure the effectiveness of our email campaigns, by counting the number of individuals who open or act upon an email message, determining when an email message is opened and determining how many times an email message is forwarded. Subject to local laws, we may combine the information that we collect through web beacons with other Personal Information we have collected from you.

The information we collect through web beacons may include some limited Personal Information, and web beacons allow us to recognize users by accessing RSA cookies. We use all of this information to better tailor our marketing to you and may use this information for other purposes, such as to enable a shopping cart, customize content on our Website and undertake internal research.

We may allow some of our Business Partners to compile individual information or aggregated statistics from the use of web beacons on our site by RSA, its agents or others, to determine the effectiveness of online marketing and to develop statistics on how often clicking on an advertisement results in a purchase or other action on the advertiser’s site. Aggregate information is anonymous and may include demographic and usage information. No Personal Information about you is shared with Business Partners for this research.

You can make some web beacons unusable by rejecting cookies in your web browser as described in the [How We and Our Partners Use Cookies](https://web.archive.org/en-us/company/privacy.html#14) section above.

When you visit our Website or view one of our email messages, we may use pixel tags (also called “clear” gifs), tracking links and/or similar technology to note some of the pages you visit on our Website. We may also use pixel tags to determine what types of email your browser supports. We may use the information collected through web beacons, pixel tags, tracking links and similar technology in combination with your Personal Information to personalize your experience on our Website and to provide you with more useful and relevant advertisements.

* * *

**SOCIAL MEDIA WIDGETS**

Our Website includes social media features, such as a Facebook “Like” button and widgets, such as the “Share this” button or interactive mini-programs that run on our Website. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Website. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy statement of the company providing it and not by this Privacy Statement.

* * *

**LINKS TO EXTERNAL WEBSITES**

Our Website may contain links to third-party sites. RSA cannot control and is not responsible for the privacy practices of such third-party sites. RSA encourages users to be aware when they leave our Website, and to read the privacy statements of each website they visit. This Privacy Statement applies only to RSA.

* * *

**BLOG / FORUM**

Our Website offers publicly-accessible blogs or community forums. Please be aware that any information you provide in these blogs or forums may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your Personal Information from our blog or community forum, contact us at [privacy@RSA.com](mailto:privacy@RSA.com).

**CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT**

RSA reserves the right to change this Privacy Statement at any time. If RSA materially changes its Privacy Statement, we will either notify users via e-mail or via a prominent notice posted on our Website prior to the change becoming effective. (see https://www.RSA.com/privacy). Changes are effective as of the date we post them on the RSA Privacy Statement page.
