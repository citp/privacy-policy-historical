<h5>IMPORTANT: BY USING THE RSA.COM WEB SITE YOU GIVE YOUR CONSENT THAT 
  ALL PERSONAL DATA THAT YOU SUBMIT MAY BE PROCESSED BY RSA SECURITY IN THE MANNER 
  AND FOR THE PURPOSES DESCRIBED IN THE FOLLOWING PRIVACY POLICY.</h5>
<h5>Definitions</h5>
<p>Rsa.com is owned and operated by RSA Security Inc. </p>
<p>The terms "RSA Security", "we", "us", "our" 
  and "ours" when used in this Privacy Policy means RSA Security Inc 
  which includes all its parents, subsidiaries, divisions, branches, affiliates 
  or companies under common ownership or control of RSA Security Inc.</p>
<p>The terms "you", "your" and "yours" when used 
  in this Privacy Policy means any user of this Web Site. </p>
<p>The term "Personal Data" refers to personally identifiable information 
  about you, such as your name, birth date, e-mail address or mailing address. 
</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes RSA Security’s current policies and practices 
  with regard to Personal Data collected by RSA Security through www.rsa.com 
  ("Web Site"). </p>
<h5>Notification of changes to this Policy</h5>
<p>We are continually improving and adding new functionality and features to this 
  Web Site and improving and adding to its existing products, services and programs. 
  Because of these ongoing changes, changes in the law and the changing nature 
  of technology, our data practices will change from time to time. If and when 
  our data practices change, we will post the changes on this Web Site to notify 
  you of the changes. We encourage you to check this page frequently. </p>
<h5>Collection of Personal Data including e-mail addresses</h5>
<p>We collect the information you give us when you use our Web Site. You may use 
  this Web Site to register to receive additional information or products from 
  us. When you register, we ask you for contact information like your name, postal 
  address and e-mail address. </p>
<p>We sometimes supplement the information that you provide with information that 
  is received from third parties. For instance, if inaccurate postal or zip codes 
  are received, we will use third party software to fix them. </p>
<h5>RSA Security Email Marketing Communication Policy</h5>
<p>RSA Security sends promotional email only to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>our customers </li>
  <li>people who have given consent to RSA Security to receive promotional email 
  </li>
  <li>people on rented email lists who have given permission to the list owner 
    to receive third-party promotional email </li>
  <li>people who have not opted out after having received promotional email from 
    us. </li>
</ul>

<p>RSA Security employs a third-party email marketing platform that helps to ensure that we provide relevant information and services to the people on the mailing list. The marketing platform:</p>

<ul><li> offers a central location for  people to opt-out of RSA Security promotional mailings

</li><li> tracks which promotional emails are delivered, opened and responded to and whether respondents subsequently visit the RSA Security web site
</li></ul>

<p>In each promotional email, we provide an easy and clear way to opt out of future 
  RSA Security email. Opt-out requests using the opt-out link in our emails are 
  processed automatically and go into effect immediately. Opt-out requests sent 
  by email are processed within 10 business days.</p>

<p>When sending email to rented email lists, we suppress addresses of those people who have opted out of RSA Security email in the past.</p>

<p>We always disclose our identity in mass email communications, including the 
  address of our headquarters location, and we always identify our mass, promotional 
  email as advertisements.</p>

<p>We never use deceiving header information or subject lines.</p>

<p>We never send mass, promotional email to email addresses “harvested” 
  from websites.</p>

<p>We never, under any circumstances, rent or sell email addresses to any other 
  company or individual.</p>

<p>When capturing email addresses via our Web forms, we always provide the opportunity 
  to opt out of promotional email.</p>

<p>When coordinating with our resellers for the purpose of follow-up on sales 
  inquiries made to us, we provide full contact information of the inquirer to 
  the reseller, including email address, so the reseller can follow up on the 
  inquiry.</p>
<p>Our marketing email policy and practice fully conforms to the United States 
  Federal “CAN SPAM” act that went in to effect on January 1, 2004. 
  Note that some regions such as the European Union, have different email laws 
  and guidelines, and RSA Security conforms to local laws in those cases. We welcome 
  and encourage your thoughts on this policy at <a href="mailto:mveit@rsa.com">mveit@rsa.com</a>.

<h5><br>
  Use of Personal Data</h5>
<p>We process your Personal Data only for specific and limited purposes. We ask 
  only for data that is adequate, relevant and not excessive for those purposes. 
  When we ask you for Personal Data, we tell you the purposes for which we will 
  process that data. Some of these purposes include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We may contact you occasionally to inform you of new services we will be 
    providing, or special offers, events or articles we think will be of interest 
    to you. </li>
  <li>We may send you regular updates by e-mail or by post on RSA Security organised 
    or related events. </li>
  <li>We may send you requested product information and promotional material. 
  </li>
  <li>We may use your Personal Data for marketing purposes and market research. 
  </li>
  <li>We may use your Personal Data internally to help us improve our products 
    and services and to help resolve any problems. </li>
</ul>
<h5>Disclosure of your Personal Data </h5>
<p>We do not share, sell or distribute your Personal Data with unrelated third 
  parties, except under these limited circumstances:</p>
<p>Personal Data may occasionally be transferred to third parties who act for 
  or on behalf of RSA Security, or in connection with the business of RSA Security 
  for further processing in accordance with the purposes for which the data was 
  originally collected or for purposes to which you have subsequently consented. 
  For example, sometimes a third party may have access to your Personal Data in 
  order to handle our mailings on our behalf.</p>
<p><br>
  We may share or transfer the information in our databases to comply with a legal 
  requirement, for the administration of justice, to protect your vital interests, 
  to protect the security or integrity of our databases or this Web Site, to take 
  precautions against legal liability, or in the event of a corporate sale, merger, 
  reorganisation, dissolution or similar event. <br>
  Where appropriate, before disclosing Personal Data to a third party, we contractually 
  require the third party to take adequate precautions to protect that data. </p>
<h5>Data Integrity and Security</h5>
<p>We strive to maintain the reliability, accuracy, completeness and currency 
  of Personal Data in our databases and to protect the privacy and security of 
  our databases. We keep your Personal Data only for as long as reasonably necessary 
  for the purposes for which it was collected or to comply with any applicable 
  legal or ethical reporting or document retention requirements. </p>
<p>Our servers and our databases are protected by industry standard security technology, 
  such as industry standard firewalls and password protection. </p>
<p>Sometimes we process sensitive data that requires industry standard Secure 
  Socket Layer (SSL) encrypted browsers. We use 128-bit encryption to protect 
  transmissions over the Internet. </p>
<p>The employees who have access to Personal Data have been trained to handle 
  such data properly and in accordance with our security protocols and strict 
  standards of confidentiality. Although we cannot guarantee against any loss, 
  misuse, unauthorised disclosure, alteration or destruction of data, we try to 
  prevent such unfortunate occurrences.</p>
<h5>Data Access and Corrections</h5>
<p>Upon receipt of your written request and enough information to permit us to 
  identify your Personal Data, we will disclose to you the Personal Data we hold 
  about you. We will also correct, amend or delete any Personal Data that is inaccurate 
  and notify any third party recipients of the necessary changes. </p>
<p>If you wish to access or correct your Personal Data, please write to our data 
  protection officer at RSA Security Inc., 174 Middlesex Turnpike, Bedford, MA 
  01730 or e-mail us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@rsa.com">webmaster@rsa.com</a>. 
  We do not charge for complying with a correction request, however, for all other 
  requests, we may charge a small fee to cover its costs. Requests to delete Personal 
  Data are subject to any applicable legal and ethical reporting or document retention 
  obligations imposed on RSA Security.</p>
<h5><br>
  Anonymous data collected through this Web Site</h5>
<p>In addition to the information we collect as described above, we use technology 
  to collect anonymous information about the use of our Web Site. This technology 
  does not identify you personally, it simply enables us to compile statistics 
  about our visitors and their use of our Web Site. </p>
<p>We use this anonymous data to improve the content and functionality of this 
  Web Site and our e-mail updates, to better understand our customers and markets, 
  and to improve our products and services.</p>

<h5>Cookies</h5>
<p>In order to collect the anonymous data described in the preceding paragraph, 
  we may use "cookies" that collect the first level domain 
  name of the user (for example, if your e-mail address is "john@bigmail.com," 
  the cookie collects the "bigmail.com" portion of your e-mail address) 
  and the date and time you accessed this Web Site. </p>

<p>Web beacons, also known as clear gif technology, or action tags, may be used to assist in delivering the cookie on our site. This technology is a tool we use to compile aggregated statistics about rsa.com Web site usage, such as how many visitors clicked on key elements (such as links or graphics) on a rsa.com Web page.

</p><p>We also use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to 
  administer our Web Site. An IP address is a numeric code that identifies your 
  computer on a network, or in this case, the Internet. Your IP address is also 
  used to gather broad demographic information, such as determining how many of 
  our visitors are from outside of the US. </p>
<p>We may also perform IP lookups to determine which domain you are coming from 
  (i.e: aol.com, yourcompany.com) to more accurately gauge our users' demographics. 
</p>
<h5>Children</h5>
<p>We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children or minors. If you are 
  a child or minor, please do not give us any Personal Data. If you have reason 
  to believe that a child has provided us with their Personal Data, please contact 
  us at the address given below and we will endeavour to delete that information 
  from our databases. </p>
<h5>Links to other web sites</h5>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to www.rsa.com and to other RSA Security 
  URLs through or from which you have reached this Web Site. This Web Site contains 
  hyperlinks to web sites that are not operated by RSA Security. These hyperlinks 
  are provided for your reference and convenience only and do not imply any endorsement 
  of the activities of these third-party web sites or any association with their 
  operators. We do not control these web sites and are not responsible for their 
  data or privacy practices. We urge you to review any privacy policy posted on 
  any site you visit before using the site or providing any Personal Data about 
  yourself. </p>
<h5>Transfer of Data Abroad</h5>
<p>RSA Security is a global enterprise and has facilities and databases in different 
  countries. We may, from time to time, transfer your Personal Data to one of 
  our databases in another country. If the level of privacy protection in a country 
  does not comply with recognised international standards, we will ensure that 
  data transferred to our databases in that country are adequately protected and 
  that the transfer of data to third parties in such countries is made pursuant 
  to a contract or other measures providing adequate protection. </p>
<p>Of course, the Internet is made up of a large number of international connections. 
  If you are visiting this Web Site from a country other than the country in which 
  our server is located (currently, the United States of America), the various 
  communications will necessarily result in the transfer of information across 
  international boundaries. By visiting this Web Site and communicating electronically 
  with us, you consent to these transfers.</p>
<h5>Governing Law</h5>
<p>This privacy policy forms part of our Web Site Terms of Use and as such shall 
  be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth 
  of Massachusetts, U.S.A. You agree to submit any dispute arising out of your 
  use of this Web Site to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Boston, 
  Massachusetts. </p>
<h5>Questions </h5>
<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or concerns about the way 
  we process your Personal Data, please contact us by e-mailing us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@rsasecurity.com">webmaster@rsasecurity.com</a>.
