### Cookies and tracking

A cookie is a piece of data about a website that is stored in your web browser. Cookies are often used to store choices about how you use the site to improve your user experience. The RSPB website makes use of cookies in this way, and also to help us get a feel for what it is you're all looking at. They are anonymous; they only give us information about the number of visitors to our site, so we don't know what you personally are looking at, more than someone has looked at what you've looked at.

Some bits of our site rely on cookies, but we'll tell you where and when. Most browsers will allow you to control how cookies are handled, whether they are accepted and how long they are stored for. All browsers do this differently, but if you're concerned about privacy and security then please have a look in the 'help' documentation for your particular browser.

We also make use of some simple image files provided by suppliers, such as DoubleClick and Google Analytics, to help measure the usage of our site, show relevant advertising and track the results of our advertising on third party websites. They are tiny and transparent, so they can't be seen, and won't make any noticeable difference to your experience, nor do they give away any personal data.

You may notice some third party cookies not related to RSPB when you visit a page, the RSPB does not control these cookies and we recommend you check the third party websites for more information.

The type of cookies used and their purpose is explained further:

  * Community Server cookies and authorization cookie are required for the provision of the community website and to provide security.
  * Personalisation module is required to provide the personalised service.
  * Google analytic cookies are used to collect information about how visitors, like yourself, use our website. This information is collected in an anonymous form and is used to inform us how the site can be improved.
  * Magento ecommerce, RSPB Images and affiliate future cookies are necessary as these enable you to make purchases, from areas such as the RSPB online shop, purchasing of memberships and images through the relevant websites.
  * Online advertising and network cookies are used to track when you have clicked on an advert, to see what pages of the website are used and this provides insight as to how improvements can be made. We also have relationships with carefully-selected advertising partners who may also set cookies during your visit to allow them to serve online advertising that we believe will be of interest to you based on information about your visit to this and other websites (this is called re-targeting). This information is anonymous and does not include personal data. For more information about this type of online behavioural advertising and about how to turn this feature off, please visit [www.youronlinechoices.co.uk](http://www.youronlinechoices.co.uk/).



A list of the main cookies the RSPB uses can be found [here](http://www.rspb.org.uk/help/cookies.aspx).

Further information about cookies including how to manage and delete them can be found at [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

### Financial security

All RSPB forms which request credit card or bank details use the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocol for encryption. Most web browsers (Microsoft Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome etc) support SSL. The link between your web browser and the server is secure if your web browser displays a small padlock or key symbol somewhere in the frame, or the address bar shows a web address beginning https:// (rather than http://).

### Links to third party websites

The RSPB website contains hyperlinks to many other websites. This information is supplied in good faith, in case it is of interest, or use, to RSPB website users. The RSPB is not responsible for the content or functionality of any of these external websites – but please let us know if a link is not working (use the '[Contact us](http://www.rspb.org.uk/contactus/)' link which can be found at the top of every page). Visitors to the RSPB website should be aware of the following:

If an external website requests personal information from you (eg in connection with an order for goods or services), this information is supplied to, stored and used by the company concerned – it is not covered by the RSPB's Data Protection Notice. It is good practice to read the privacy policy of any website at which you are considering registering any personal information.

In purchasing goods or services from any of the companies to which the RSPB site links, you are forming a contract with the company(s) concerned (agreeing to their terms and conditions), not the RSPB.

### Notification of change of Privacy Policy

The RSPB reserves the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time. Notice of any change will be posted on our website and will be deemed effective on publication. Your continued use of this website after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of these Terms and Conditions.
