# The RSPB: About our site: Privacy

[](https://web.archive.org/web/20071210214136id_/http%3A//www.rspb.org.uk/help/privacy.asp?view=print)

The RSPB is committed to protecting your privacy and security. Whenever you provide personal information, we will treat that information in accordance with this policy, current UK Data Protection legislation and Internet best practice.

### Data protection

You can use almost all the features of this site without disclosing any personal information. A few optional features of this site, such as membership enrolment forms, ask you to provide some personal information (e.g. name and address, e-mail address). This information will be used only by RSPB and RSPB Sales Limited - we never sell your details to anyone else.

We will analyse information gathered from the website in an effort to determine which communications are most effective, in order to reduce RSPB administration costs and increase funds available for conservation. If we wish to use your personal information for an additional purpose, we will always ask you to agree at the point of collection.

If you have already supplied us with personal information, you can change your instructions at any time.

### Users aged under 16

If you are aged under 16, please ensure you obtain your parent/guardian's consent before sending any personal information to this website, including any information on our ‘Make a comment’ forms. Please note that the RSPB will not accept online donations or orders for goods or services from persons aged under 16 years.

### Cookies

A cookie is a very small text file placed on your computer's hard disk (by a website server) when you visit certain web pages. It is associated with the computer you use, not you personally, and it cannot deliver viruses.

The RSPB website uses some cookies. For example, cookies are used to save you time filling in certain forms, by automatically entering some details for you (if you want to change any details which are automatically inserted, you can simply type over any text). If you disable the use of cookies in your browser, we cannot guarantee that all parts of the site will work.

We use pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These GIF files are provided by our ad management partner, DoubleClick. These files enable DoubleClick to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website. The cookie was placed by us, or by another advertiser who works with DoubleClick. With both cookies and Spotlight technology, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address. For more information about DoubleClick, including information about how to opt out of these technologies, visit the link on this page.

### Financial security

All RSPB forms which request credit card or bank details use the SSL (secure sockets layer) protocol for encryption. Most browsers (including current versions of Microsoft Explorer and Netscape Navigator) support SSL. The link between your browser and the server is secure if your browser displays a small padlock or key symbol somewhere in the frame, or the address bar shows a web address beginning _https://_ (rather than http://).

### Links to third party websites

The RSPB website contains hyperlinks to many other websites. This information is supplied in good faith, in case it is of interest, or use, to RSPB website users. The RSPB is not responsible for the content or functionality of any of these external websites - but please let us know if a link is not working (use the ‘Make a comment form’, a link to which can be found at the bottom of every page). Visitors to the RSPB website should be aware of the following:

* If an external website requests personal information from you (e.g. in connection with an order for goods or services), this information is supplied to, stored and used by the company concerned - it is not covered by the RSPB’s Data Protection Statement. It is good practice to read the privacy policy of any website at which you are considering registering any personal information.

In purchasing goods or services from any of the companies to which the RSPB site links, you are forming a contract with the company(s) concerned (agreeing to their terms and conditions), not the RSPB.
