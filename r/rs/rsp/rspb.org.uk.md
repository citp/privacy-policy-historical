### Cookies and tracking

A cookie is a piece of data about a website that is stored in your web browser. Cookies are often used to store choices about how you use the site to improve your user experience. The RSPB website makes use of cookies in this way, and also to help us get a feel for what it is you're all looking at. They're anonymous, they only give us information about the number of visitors to our site. so we don't know what you personally are looking at, more than someone has looked at what you've looked at.

Some bits of our site rely on cookies, but we'll tell you where and when. Most browsers will allow you to control how cookies are handled, whether they are accepted and how long they are stored for. All browsers do this differently, but if you're concerned about privacy and security then please have a look in the 'help' documentation for your particular browser.

We also make use of some simple image files provided by suppliers, such as DoubleClick and Sitestat, to help measure the usage of our site and the results of our advertising on third party websites. They are tiny and transparent, so they can't be seen, and won't make any noticeable difference to your experience, nor do they give away any personal data.

### Financial security

All RSPB forms which request credit card or bank details use the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocol for encryption. Most browsers (Microsoft Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, etc) support SSL. The link between your browser and the server is secure if your browser displays a small padlock or key symbol somewhere in the frame, or the address bar shows a web address beginning https:// (rather than http://).

### Links to third party websites

The RSPB website contains hyperlinks to many other websites. This information is supplied in good faith, in case it is of interest, or use, to RSPB website users. The RSPB is not responsible for the content or functionality of any of these external websites – but please let us know if a link is not working (use the 'Contact us' link which can be found at the top of every page). Visitors to the RSPB website should be aware of the following:

If an external website requests personal information from you (eg. in connection with an order for goods or services), this information is supplied to, stored and used by the company concerned – it is not covered by the RSPB's Data Protection Notice. It is good practice to read the privacy policy of any website at which you are considering registering any personal information.

In purchasing goods or services from any of the companies to which the RSPB site links, you are forming a contract with the company(s) concerned (agreeing to their terms and conditions), not the RSPB.
