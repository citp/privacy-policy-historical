Please note that RSM clients will continue to receive electronic communications from us relating to our provision of services to them.  If required under local law, we may seek your express consent to send you marketing communications.

### IV.  Join Our Team

You can submit your resume and other information online to apply for a job with us. We use the information you submit to evaluate your qualifications, to contact you regarding possible current and future employment opportunities, and for other employment related purposes.

### V.  Surveys and Questionnaires

We occasionally may ask visitors to our website, clients, and other contacts to complete online surveys and opinion polls about their activities, attitudes and interests. These surveys help us understand the needs of our website visitors, clients, and contacts; evaluate client service satisfaction; and enhance our product and service offerings.

### VI.  Tracking Activity on Our Website

  In order to improve the site, we may track whether or not a site visitor is new or returning and collect information about our users through automatic data collection tools, which may include “cookies” and other commonly used technologies (e.g. web beacons). This information includes, without limitation, your web browser, location, and Internet Protocol (IP) address. Cookies are small strings of text that are sent by the site to your browser and then stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive. Information collected via cookies will be used solely for statistical reporting, unless you are a repeat visitor to our website, in which case a code in the cookie file may enable the site to label you as a particular user so that we may personalize and enhance your experience on our site.  In addition, if you submit personal information (e.g., name, address, email, etc.) via an electronic form contained on our website, the cookie file may enable us to identify you by such personally identifiable information in connection with collecting statistical information and personalizing your experience on our site.  Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but it is possible to change your browser setup so that it does not accept cookies.  However, rejecting cookies may prevent you from taking advantage of certain portions of our site. To find out more about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them, visit the website: [http://www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

We also use a tracking service that allows us to determine if a visitor accessed our website from a third-party advertisement service. This information is only a transaction count.

Except as expressly set forth in this Privacy Policy, we do not engage in the collection of personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. Accordingly, we do not currently process or comply with any Web browser’s “do not track” signal or other mechanisms that provide consumers with the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites. Further, except as expressly set forth in this Privacy Policy, we have not knowingly authorized any third parties to collect personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you use the site. Nonetheless, such third-party companies (e.g., companies providing features or functionality on the site, etc.) may collect and use information during your visits to our site and other websites in order to provide advertisements on other sites about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or a third-party Web beacon to collect such information.

### VII.  Information We Share

We do not sell, rent, trade or otherwise disclose personal information about our website visitors, clients or other individuals, except as described here. We may, as permitted by law, share information provided by our website visitors, clients or other individuals with our affiliates and with service providers we may retain to perform services on our behalf.  For example, we use services providers to provide services such as hosting the RSM US LLP and RSM Canada LLP sites and operating certain of their features, document and data storage and management, providing client services, maintaining the security of our systems, software support and office services, and sending email or other communications. These service providers are not authorized by us to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements. In addition, we may disclose information about you (i) if we are required or permitted to do so by applicable US, Canadian or other laws or regulations or by legal process, (ii) in response to a search warrant or other request from law enforcement authorities or other government officials in such jurisdictions, (iii) if we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity, (iv) to protect the integrity or security of the site or the interests, rights or property of RSM, including to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim; (v) to detect, prevent or suppress fraud; and/or (vi) to investigate a breach of, or to enforce our sites’ terms of use or other applicable agreements. 

RSM may also disclose or otherwise transfer your personal information to governmental and regulatory authorities in the course of providing services to you (such as the preparation of taxation and other returns), and to other member firms in the RSM International network where necessary for the purposes of providing services to global clients.

Your personal information may be maintained on servers in the US, and processed by our affiliates and other third party service providers in the US or other jurisdictions and as such, your data is subject to American law. You can withdraw your consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
