# Privacy Policy

## Information We Collect and How We Use It

You may choose to provide either business or personally identifiable or "personal" information (such as your name, address, business telephone number and email address) on this website. Here are the ways you may provide the information, the types of information you may submit and how RSM US LLP and/or its affiliates (collectively, "RSM US," "we," "us" or "our") may collect, retain and use information.

### Contacting Us

Our site permits you to reach out to us via our Contact Us forms. If you wish to receive additional information provided on our website, we ask you to provide certain information such as your name, email address and business contact information. We store this information and use it to respond to your inquiries.

In addition, from time to time, RSM US may send you details of products and services which we think may be of interest to you, but we will only do this if you have indicated that you wish to receive such communications.

### Event Registration

If you wish to attend an RSM US sponsored event, we ask you to provide certain information such as your name, address, business telephone number and email address. We use this information to contact you regarding the event.

### Publications

When you sign up online to receive one of our publications, we ask for your name, mailing address, business telephone number and email address. We may use this information to contact you regarding promotions.

### Join Our Team

You can submit your resume and other information online to apply for a job with us. We use the information you submit only to evaluate your qualifications and to contact you regarding possible employment.

### Surveys and Questionnaires

We occasionally may ask visitors to our website to complete online surveys and opinion polls about their activities, attitudes and interests. These surveys help us understand the needs of our website visitors.

### Tracking Activity on Our Website

When browsing our website, unless specifically requesting a service, personally identifiable information is not collected from any new users.  We may, however, track whether or not a site visitor is new or returning and collect information about our users through “cookies.”  Cookies are small strings of text that are sent by the site to your browser and then stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive.  Information collected via cookies will be used solely for statistical reporting only, unless you are a repeat visitor to our website, in which case a code in the cookie file may enable the site to label you as a particular user so that we may personalize and enhance your experience on our site.  In addition, if you submit personal information (e.g., name, address, email, etc.) via an electronic form contained on our website, the cookie file may enable us to identify you by such personally identifiable information in connection with collecting statistical information and personalizing your experience on our site.  Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but it is possible to change your browser setup so that it does not accept cookies.  However, rejecting cookies may prevent you from taking advantage of certain portions of our site.

We also use a tracking service that allows us to determine if a visitor accessed our website from a third-party advertisement service. This information is only a transaction count and does not contain any information that could identify an individual user.

Except as expressly set forth in this Privacy Policy, we do not engage in the collection of personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. Accordingly, we do not currently process or comply with any Web browser’s “do not track” signal or other mechanisms that provide consumers with the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites. Further, except as expressly set forth in this Privacy Policy, we have not knowingly authorized any third parties to collect personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you use the site. Nonetheless, such third-party companies (e.g., companies providing features or functionality on the site, etc.) may collect and use non-personal information during your visits to our site and other websites in order to provide advertisements on other sites about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or a third-party Web beacon to collect such information.

### Information We Share

We do not sell, rent, trade or otherwise disclose personal information about our website visitors, except as described here. We may, as permitted by law, share information provided by our website visitors with our affiliates and with service providers we may retain to perform services on our behalf. These service providers are not authorized by us to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements. In addition, we may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by applicable laws or regulations or by legal process, (ii) in response to a request from law enforcement authorities or other government officials, (iii) if we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity, (iv) to protect the integrity or security of the site or the interests, rights or property of RSM US, and/or (v) to enforce our site’s [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/who-we-are/terms-of-use.html).

### Links to Other Sites

On occasion, we provide links to other websites for your convenience and information. These sites operate independently from [www.rsmus.com](http://www.rsmus.com/) and are not under our control. These sites may have their own privacy notices in place, which we strongly suggest you review if you visit any linked websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or policies of such third parties, content of these sites, any products or services that may be offered through these sites, or any other use of these sites.

### Children Under Age 18

While the content of our page may be suitable for audiences of any age, the site is not designed for children and we do not knowingly collect, use or disclose any personally identifiable information from those under the age of 18, without the consent of a parent or guardian. By accessing and using our site, you hereby represent that you are at least 18 years of age.

### Security

We use commercially reasonable measures to secure this website to protect against unauthorized disclosure, use, alteration or destruction of information in our possession. Please be aware, however, that Internet data transmission is not always secure, and we cannot and do not guarantee that information you transmit utilizing our site is secure.

### Business Transfer

If we should in the future sell or otherwise transfer some or all of our assets to a third party, the personally identifiable information and/or other information we obtain from you via our site may be disclosed to any potential or actual purchasers of such assets or may be among those assets transferred.

### Users Outside the United States of America

If you are a resident of a country within the European Union or are otherwise accessing our site from outside the United States of America, by using this site and providing us your personally identifiable information, you hereby explicitly acknowledge and agree to (i) the transfer of such information to the United States and (ii) the collection, use and disclosure of your personally identifiable information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

### Acceptance of this Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms of the RSM US [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/who-we-are/terms-of-use.html). By using this site and voluntarily providing any personally identifiable information to us, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personally identifiable information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
