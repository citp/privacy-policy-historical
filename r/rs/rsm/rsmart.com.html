<p>                The rSmart Group enables the data you input to be encrypted when                in route between your browser and the The rSmart Group server and                when in route between the The rSmart Group server and some other                browser or server. This practice helps prevent unauthorized third                parties from intercepting and gaining access to your private data                during transmission over the Internet. The rSmart Group uses 40-bit,                Secure Socket Layer encryption supported by most browsers.
