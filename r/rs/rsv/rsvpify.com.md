USING INFORMATION FROM RSVPIFY

We encourage you to disclose your privacy practices and respect the privacy of other users. We cannot guarantee the privacy or security of your information.

HOW WE USE COOKIES

When you access our website, or use our applications and/or services and tools, we may place small data files on your computer or other device. We use these data files, commonly known as “Cookies”, to help us identify you as a user, customize our services, content and advertising, to measure promotional effectiveness, and to promote trust and safety.

A few important things you should know about our use of Cookies:

  * We offer certain features that are available only through the use of Cookies
  * We use both session and persistent Cookies. Session Cookies expire and no longer have any effect when you log out of your account or close your browser. Persistent Cookies remain on your device until you erase them or they expire
  * You are always free to decline Cookies if your browser permits, although doing so may interfere with your use of our website, applications, and/or services and tools. Refer to the help section of your browser, browser extensions, or installed applications for instructions on blocking, deleting, or disabling Cookies
  * We encode and protect our Cookies so that only we can interpret the information stored in them
  * You may encounter Cookies from third parties, known as service providers, that we have allowed on our site that assist us with various aspects of our web site operations and services
  * You also may encounter Cookies from third parties on certain pages of the website that we do not control and have not authorized. (For example, if you view a web page created by another user, there may be a cookie placed by that web page)



NO SPAM, SPYWARE OR SPOOFING

We and our users do not tolerate spam. Make sure to set your RSVPify communication preferences so we communicate to you as you prefer. You are not licensed to add other RSVPify users, even a user who has purchased an item from you, to your mailing list (email or physical mail) without their express consent. To report RSVPify-related spam or spoof emails to RSVPify, please forward the email to support@RSVPify.com or support@RSVPify.com. You may not use our communication tools to send spam or otherwise send content that would violate our Terms of Service. We automatically scan and may manually filter messages to check for spam, viruses, phishing attacks and other malicious activity or illegal or prohibited content, but we do not permanently store messages sent through these tools. If you send an email to an email address that is not registered in our community (via Refer-a-Friend or other tools), we do not permanently store that email or use that email address for any marketing purpose. We do not rent or sell these email addresses.

ACCESSING, REVIEWING AND CHANGING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

Your password is the key to your account. Use unique numbers, letters and special characters, and do not disclose your RSVPify password to anyone. If you do share your password or your personal information with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions taken in the name of your account. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately notify RSVPify and change your password.

You can see, review and change most of your personal information by signing on to RSVPify. Generally, we will not manually modify your personal information because it is very difficult to verify your identity remotely. You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate.

If you disclose your information to others, whether they are TaskListers or RSVPifys on our site or other site throughout the internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you provide to them. RSVPify does not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.
