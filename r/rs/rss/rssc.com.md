**Frequently Asked Questions -- Data Privacy**

**Who are we?**

Regent Seven Seas Cruises, with headquarters in Fort Lauderdale, is owned by Prestige Cruise Holdings, a subsidiary of Apollo Management L.P. Prestige Cruise Holdings is the market leader in the Upper Premium and Luxury segments of the cruise industry with more than 4,450 berths between the Regent Seven Seas and Oceania Cruises brands, a number the company expects will grow to more than 6,700 berths by 2011.

The content of this site is beneficially owned by Prestige Cruise Holdings, Inc., the parent company of Regent Seven Seas Cruises and is the owner and operator of such brands that include Oceania Cruises, Inc., among others. 

**How can someone learn about our privacy practices?**

Wherever we ask for your personal information, we will let you know how you can find out about the steps we take to guard your information. If we are asking you for information online, such as on one of our websites, we will provide a link to our privacy policy. If you are making a reservation by phone, our operators will be able to answer your privacy questions. 

**What personal information do we collect, how, and why?**

Our sole purpose in collecting your personal information is to provide the level of hospitality you expect. By learning more about you and your preferences, we can provide you meaningful offers and deliver services that meet your highest standards.

We will require the minimum amount of information from you that we need to provide our services. We will indicate the minimum required information on forms that we ask you to complete. Here are examples of instances when we may collect personal information:

  * If you're creating an online account at RSSC.com, we will require your e-mail address and a password. You have the option of including demographic information about your cruise preferences. If you do, we will use that information to provide specific information to you about cruises that match your geographic preference. 
  * If you sign up to receive the Seven Seas Explorer e-newsletter, we will ask for your name and e-mail address. 
  * If you use the "Find a Travel Agent" feature on RSSC.com, we will ask for a zip code to help us narrow your search. If you also provide your email address or telephone number, a travel agent may follow-up with you. 
  * If you request a cruise reservation on RSSC.com, we will ask for your name, address, phone number, and e-mail address to facilitate your reservation with one of our customer service representatives. 
  * If you order cruise brochures on RSSC.com, we will require your name, address, and e-mail in order to successfully process your order. 
  * Once you reserve your cruise with us, we will ask you to complete a government-required Guest Information Form that will include your name, address, phone number, date of birth, gender, passport number, and any special health considerations. 



**When you cruise with us, you will need to bring your passport.**

We believe that in order to make your stay with us pleasing and comfortable, we must strive to anticipate your needs. To do this, we will occasionally ask for your hospitality and cruising preferences. If you provide us comments through our guest cards, we will use your information to improve our services. We try to identify passengers who cruise with us a number of times to let them know about special offers they may be eligible for. To learn more about the needs and wishes of cruise customers and to accurately administer their records, we occasionally obtain customer information from companies outside our family of businesses, but will do so only if these companies have permission to share that information with us.

If you are visiting one of our websites, we track the IP address of the computer you're using and the places on our websites you visit. This information does not contain any personally identifiable information. We track this information without your name and use it to improve the visitor experience on our websites. Web beacons/clear gifs are used primarily as tracking mechanisms throughout the site. They allow us to monitor user clickstream activity on our site in order for us to make changes that will allow for the site visitors to more easily accomplish their tasks on our site.

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site or our cruises, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. We do not store this information.

**How do we use cookies?**

Like many commercial websites, we use "cookies". Cookies are small files placed on your computer that contain information you've provided to the website. For example, when you ask one of our websites to log you in automatically each time you visit the site, we'll place a cookie on your computer to enable that to happen. We may also use temporary cookies that expire after 30 days to track referrals to our websites. We utilize a third party to help us analyze the traffic that goes to this site. The third party does not gain access to any personal identifiable information.

**Do we collect information from children?**

No. We do not knowingly request personally identifiable information from children.

**How long do we keep your information?**

We will keep information associated with your name for only as long as we need it or as required or permitted by law. We have a corporate records management program that drives all our retention initiative.

**How do we use your information for marketing?**

If you have given us your postal or email address, we may send you marketing information. At that time, we will also let you know how to remove your name from our marketing efforts. We will honor your marketing preferences. 

**How can you remove your name from our lists?**

Contact [information@rssc.com](mailto:information@rssc.com) or 1-800-477-7500 to request that you not be contacted for marketing purposes. Our e-mailed offers also include instructions for unsubscribing from future e-mailed offers. If you want to be removed only from our postal mailing list, please provide us with your complete name and address. 

**How can you access the information we've collected about you?**

Contact [privacy@rssc.com](mailto:privacy@rssc.com) or 1-800-477-7500 and request that a copy of your personal profile be delivered to your home or e-mail address. We'll use secure means to confirm your identity to prevent the wrong people from accessing your information. 

**How can you make corrections to your personal information?**

Contact [privacy@rssc.com](mailto:privacy@rssc.com) or 1-800-477-7500 and request that we correct inaccuracies in your personal information, such as your name and address, or ask that we delete or remove your personal information from our records. Note that our ability to permanently delete your personal information may be limited by laws that require retention of certain types of data for a minimum amount of time. 

We also try to ensure that our customer addresses remain current by checking them against the national change-of-address lists that postal services make available. To deactivate your online account with us, contact us at the information above. We'll respond to your request within 30 days. 

**Do we share your information with other companies?**

We will not sell your information. We will also not share your information with businesses outside Prestige Cruise Holdings brands for purposes unrelated to providing the services you have sought from us, unless you have first given us your permission.

One level of sharing occurs when we contract with other companies to help provide our cruise services. For example, when you reserve a cruise through an affiliated travel agent, that travel agent - who is not an employee of Regent Seven Seas Cruises \- will need to share your booking information with us in order to reserve your voyage. We contract with other companies to provide services on our ship and at ports of call. For example, if you pay for a cruise using a credit card, we will authorize that payment through a third party. An outside telephone company also provides the telephone network we use to transmit information between our buildings and systems. We will use other companies to prepare and send surface mail and e-mail to customers. Whenever we contract with outside companies, we will hold them accountable to protect your information with generally accepted industry standards. When we provide a partner travel agent with your personal information to fulfill your request, the travel agent may also use your personal information to contact you regarding his/her own travel specials.

Another level of sharing occurs with government agencies. Because our ships sail internationally, we are routinely required by the governments of our ports of call to provide information to them about our passengers. In other cases, we may be required by law enforcement or other government authorities to provide personally identifiable information to them for other law-enforcement purposes such as responding to a subpoena. In these instances, we will comply with our obligations and seek to do so in a way that protects your information.

**Do our websites send your information to other companies?**

Our websites do not use technologies called "spyware" that secretly collect and transmit information about you outside the domain of the website.

Be aware, however, that whenever you click on any advertisements on the Internet, the companies placing the ads may collect information about you through the use of cookies. Because of the way the Internet technically operates, we cannot control this collection of information. You should contact these advertisers or content providers if you have any questions about their use of the information they collect.

Regent Seven Seas Cruises does contract with other companies to supplement the services we offer on our websites. In these instances, your information may be routed through these companies. Whenever we contract with outside companies, we will hold them accountable to protect our information with generally accepted industry standards.

Please see the Terms and Conditions of RSSC.com for additional information about how site operates.

**Do we transmit your information outside your country of residence?**

As a global company, our operations cross national boundaries by necessity. We maintain our central data operations in North America. If you reserve your cruise through an agent in Europe, for example, your transaction will be processed by our computers in the U.S. If you call from the U.S. to make a reservation, your call may be taken by an operator in the U.K. In these cases, we will ensure that all of our locations are protecting your information to the same high level of security. 

**What security controls do we use to protect your information?**

We use a combination of basic and advanced technical and procedural controls to prevent unauthorized people from seeing, altering, or obtaining your personal information. We operate secure data networks protected by industry-standard firewalls and intrusion-detection sensors. We frequently update our antivirus mechanisms and security patches. Our site uses SSL during the transmission of sensitive personal information such as credit card numbers and social security numbers.

**How do we enforce our privacy principles?**

We undertake several initiatives to ensure our global operations are meeting our ten privacy principles, including providing awareness training to our staff. Our privacy and security policies and practices are regularly reviewed and enhanced. If you have questions or concerns about Regent Seven Seas privacy practices, contact RSSC at [privacy@rssc.com](mailto:privacy@rssc.com).

**How do we make notification of changes to our privacy policy?**

We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Policy at any time. Changes to this Policy may affect our use of personal information that you provided us prior to the effective date of the changes. If we make material changes to this Policy, we'll notify you by emailing you at the address we have on file, or by putting a notice of the change on our home page at least 30 days prior to the effective date of the change and highlighting the changes in the Policy so that you can locate them easily. This Policy will be replaced by the new Policy and the effective date above will be updated. Your continued registration with our products or services or use of our Website following a change to this Policy will indicate your acceptance of the revised Policy.
