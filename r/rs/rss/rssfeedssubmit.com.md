We believe your business is no one else's. Your privacy is important to you…and to us. So we'll protect the information you share with us. 

We won’t sell or give away your name, mail address, phone number, email address, credit card number or any other information to anyone. 

We’ll use state-of-the-art security measures to protect your information from unauthorized users. 

For more details, please read our privacy statement below.

**Privacy Statement**  
What we do with the information you share.  
When you join us, you provide us with your contact information, including your name and email address. We use this information to send you updates about your order, questionnaires to measure your satisfaction with our service and announcements about new and exciting services that we offer.

When you order from us, we ask for your credit card number and billing address. We use this information only to bill you for the product(s) you order at that time. For your convenience, we do save billing information in case you want to order from us again, but we don't use this information again without your permission.

Your information is safe with us.

We use several security measures to protect your information against loss, misuse or alteration. We rely on dual redundant security firewalls, a 24x7 security monitoring team, hardened NT and Unix operating systems and restricted port access.

**Security**   
We guarantee your e-commerce transactions to be 100% safe and secure. When you place orders or access your personal account information, you're utilizing a secure server software SSL, which encrypts your personal information before it's sent over the Internet. SSL is one of the safest encryption technologies available.

In addition, your transactions are guaranteed under the Fair Credit Billing Act. This Act states that your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00 in fraudulent credit card charges. If your bank does hold you liable for $50.00 or less, we'll cover your liability provided the unauthorized, fraudulent use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own and from purchases made from us over our secure server. In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.
