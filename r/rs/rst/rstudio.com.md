## Information We Collect

**Personal Information**. By using our Websites or purchasing products or services from us, you voluntarily and willingly provide us with certain information, including Personal Information, which we collect in order to provide the Websites and/or the products or services you may order. Personal Information refers to information about you that can be used to contact or identify you, and information on your use of and activities at our Websites that may be connected with you. Personal Information that we collect may include, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, credit card or other billing information, email address and home and business postal addresses. Personal Information may also include information you supply to us concerning your preferences and interests expressed in the course of use of our Websites and products or services. For example, we collect Personal Information when you purchase a product, contact us for customer or technical support, or participate in promotions. From time to time in the future, we may offer additional products, features, services and promotional opportunities that would require you to submit Personal Information to us in order to participate. If you are unsure whether you would like to provide information to us and/or having your information used as permitted in this Privacy Policy, you should not use our Websites or otherwise provide this information to us.

**Account and Profile Information**. We collect information about you and your company as you register for an account, create or modify your profile, make purchases through, use, access, or interact with our Websites and/or our products and services (including but not limited to when you upload, download, collaborate on or share Content). If you are providing information (including Personal Information) about someone else, you confirm that you have the authority to act for them and to consent to the collection and use of their Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.

**Content**. We collect and store Content that you create, input, submit, post, upload, transmit, store or display in the process of using our products, services or Websites.

We also collect “Navigational Information” such as your IP address as well as browser type, internet service provider, URLs of referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, information you search for, locale and language preferences, identification numbers associated with your devices, your mobile carrier, and system configuration information. Some Navigational Information may be associated with Personal Information.

**Analytics Information**. We and our analytics provider collect and store analytics information when you use our Websites and/or our products and services to help us improve our Websites, products and services. This analytics information consists of web browsing behavior collected through a combination of HTTP beacons and cookies.  Analytics information also consists of data we collect as a result of running queries against Content across our user base for the purposes of generating Usage Data. “Usage Data” is aggregated data about a group or category of services, features or users that does not contain Personal Information. Though we may happen upon sensitive or Personal Information as we compile Usage Data from Content across user instances, this is a byproduct of our efforts to understand broader patterns and trends. It is not a concerted effort by us to examine the Content of any particular customer. Some of our products contain a feature that sends information about the version of the products on your systems (“System Information”) to us. System Information includes information about (i) the server environment in which the product is operating:  OS type and version, language and locale settings; (ii) user client information, for example: browser type and version, native client type and version, and client device specifications (e.g. screen resolution, OS version, device type, etc.).  You can disable our collection of analytics information from products via the administrator settings or by blocking collection at the local network level.

As of the date this policy went into effect, we use Google Analytics as an analytics provider. To learn more about the privacy policy of Google Analytics, refer to [Google’s Policies and Principles](https://www.google.com/policies/). Use the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en) to prevent to analytics information from being sent to Google Analytics.

## How We Collect Information

We collect your information in the following ways:

**Log Files**. We may collect anonymous demographic information, which is not unique to you, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites using log files, when you use our Websites and/or our products and services. There is also information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by our Websites. This information may include, but is not limited to, your computer’s Internet Protocol address, browser type, the web page you were visiting before you came to our site, information you search for, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. We may also collect information about the fact that you use certain features and functionality of our service and your responses to our surveys and research initiatives. This information is used by us for the operation of the Websites, to maintain quality of the Websites, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the Website. For these purposes, we do link this automatically-collected data to Personal Information such as name, email address, address, and phone number.

**Cookies**. Like most websites, we use “cookies” and web log files to collect information to track site usage and trends, to improve our service, and to deliver a customized experience when you use our Websites and/or our products and services. A cookie is a small data file that is placed on your computer, mobile phone or other device by a web server and enables us to recognize you when you return to our site or log into our service. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time – for example, when you return to the same website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that you customized. We may use “persistent cookies” to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the site. We may also use “session ID cookies”, which expire after a short period of time or when you close your browser. Session ID cookies are used to identify a particular visit and are used to enable certain features of the site or service, to better understand how you interact with the site and service, and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the site. We set a cookie and use local storage in your browser that contains information that we use to identify you for the functional site features described below with respect to our current third party vendors Marketo, Drift, Clearbit, Uberflip, Addthis,Segment, Reachforce, Fivetran, FeedOtter, Metadata.io, LiveRamp, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Citrix, Eventbrite, Meetup, EventFarm, Cvent, Zapier, Salesforce, Wistia, VWO, AdRoll, Hotjar, Vimeo, YouTube, Google AdWords, Google Tag Manager, and Google Analytics. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Websites. We keep track of the pages you visit on the Websites, in order to determine what parts of our store and the Websites are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising on the Websites to visitors whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.

**During Installation of Our Products**. During installation, our software products and services may ask you to “opt-in” to the collection of diagnostic information regarding your use of our software or hardware in order to help our engineers improve our products or services. If you opt in, you agree that we may collect, maintain, and use information about the operation of our products and services.

**While Browsing our Website.** We use vendors that may collect Personal Information on our behalf.  Please see the list of vendors that we currently use and how they may access and use your data, including links to their respective privacy policies at the end of this Privacy Policy.

**Service Providers.** We monitor the activity on our Website using common software tools and third party service providers. We collect and track information on use of the Website including referral sources, search terms, network information, IP addresses, computer and browser types, and content viewed.

We retain information about our customers for as long as we need it to provide service to the customer. We will delete this information from our servers at an earlier date if you so request, as described in “Opting-Out and Unsubscribing” below.

If you are an individual based in the EU you can request a copy of your personal data and you can update any incorrect information.

If you are an individual based in the EU, you can ask to have your personal data removed, or in some cases limit our processing of personal data. This does not apply when we need to keep your personal data for legal reasons.

Correcting your information: We want to have accurate data. Please contact us if you think the personal data you provided to us is not up to date or correct.

Deletion of your information: You have the right to ask us to delete personal data about you if it no longer is required for the purpose it was collected, you have withdrawn your consent, you have a valid objection to us using your personal data, or our use of your personal data is contrary to law or our other legal obligations.

Objecting to how we may use your information: You have the right at any time to require us to stop using your personal data for direct marketing purposes.  In addition, where we use your personal data to perform tasks carried out in the public interest then, if you ask us to, we will stop using that personal data unless there are overriding legitimate grounds to continue.

Restricting how we may use your information: In some cases, you may ask us to restrict how we use your personal data.  This right might apply, for example, where we are checking the accuracy of personal data about you that we hold or assessing the validity of any objection you have made to our use of your personal data.  The right might also apply where this is no longer a basis for using your personal data but you don’t want us to delete the data.  Where this right to validly exercised, we may only use the relevant personal data with your consent, for legal claims or where there are other public interest grounds to do so.

Automated processing: If we use your personal data on an automated basis to make decisions which significantly affect you, you have the right to ask that the decision be reviewed by an individual to whom you may make representations and contest the decision.  This right only applies where we use your personal data with your consent or as part of a contractual relationship with you.

Withdrawing consent using your information: Where we use your personal data with your consent you may withdraw that consent at any time and we will stop using your personal data for the purpose(s) for which consent was given.

Please contact if you wish to exercise any of these rights. You can find the contact details below under “Opting-Out and Unbsubscribing”.

## Your California Privacy Rights

Residents of the State of California, under California Civil Code § 1798.83, have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed personal information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that gives either an opt-out or opt-in choice for use of your personal information by third parties (such as advertisers) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options.

RStudio qualifies for the alternative option. We have a comprehensive privacy statement, and provide you with details on how you may either opt-out or opt-in to the use of your personal information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your personal information for marketing purposes during the preceding year.

If you are a California resident and wish to request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices, please email us at [privacy@rstudio.com](mailto:privacy@rstudio.com).

**How You Can Opt Out of Web Tracking.  **There are several ways to opt out of web tracking:

Most browsers allow you to block third-party cookies or prevent cross-domain tracking. This will limit the cookies that can be set by third-party scripts. This will not completely eliminate tracking by some third-party services though as they may use first-party cookies.

Most browsers also allow you ask not to be tracked (it sends the “Do Not Track” request header). If you have enabled this feature, we will not track the pages you visit in a way that enables us to connect them to your personal information. Your page views may still be collected anonymously though. Many of the third-party services we use for collecting anonymous data also respect the Do Not Track setting.
