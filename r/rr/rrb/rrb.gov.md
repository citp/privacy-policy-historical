# RRB: Our Privacy Policy & E-mail Notice

Privacy Policy

The privacy of our customers has always been important to the Railroad Retirement Board. Our concern for your privacy is no different in the electronic age.

Our internet privacy policy embodies the following principles: 

  * You do not have to give us personal information to visit our site. 
  * We collect personally identifiable information (such as name, e-mail address, Social Security number, or other unique identifier) only if specifically and knowingly provided by you. You should note, however, that when you send us an e-mail, you automatically furnish us with your e-mail address, even if you don't furnish any additional personal information.
  * Personally identifying information that you voluntarily provide us will be used only for the purpose you intend it. For example, if you e-mail us a suggestion on how we can improve our website, we will use the information you provide only for that purpose. If you complete a form to ask us a specific question about your benefits and provide us with the needed identifying information and where we can reach you, we will use the information to obtain an answer and respond to you (by mail or phone.) 
  * We do not use persistent cookies.  We do use session cookies to enable our customers to use certain web applications.  Session cookies are deleted when the user leaves the application. 
  * Certain non-personal information about your visit to our website is collected for statistical purposes. The RRB sometimes analyzes the information to measure customer interest in the various areas of our site. 
  * We do not give, sell, or transfer any personal information to a third party. 



E-Mail Notice

You have the option of using e-mail to contact us. This is not secure e-mail! We ask that you not send information by e-mail that you would not want a third party to read. If you need to provide us with personal information, such as your Social Security number or home address, please call, write or visit your field office. 

In reply, we will send you only general information by e-mail. If we can identify you and have your telephone number or address in our records, we will furnish any personal information by telephone or letter. This helps to ensure we do not send your personal information to someone asking for it without your knowledge.
