DFIN reserves the right to transfer and disclose your information if DFIN becomes involved in a business divestiture, change of control, sale, merger, or acquisition of all or a part of its business.

## How We Share Your Personal Information

DFIN may share personal information we collect about you with our affiliates, business partners, service providers, subsidiaries, vendors, consultants and other service providers to perform work on our behalf. The information may be shared with third parties to offer or provide related services.

We may also share information with our customers when they need access to such personal information to fulfil specific transactions related to service you requested such as promotional campaigns. You may opt out of sharing your information with customers for related services by sending an email to [dataprivacy@dfinsolutions.com](mailto:dataprivacy@dfinsolutions.com). Upon receipt of your request to opt out of this information sharing, we will acknowledge your request and take appropriate measures in response.

These third party websites are operated by companies that are outside of our control, and your activities at those third party websites will be governed by the policies and practices of those third parties. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third parties before disclosing any information, as we are not responsible for the privacy policies of those websites.

DFIN may share your personal information in connection with or during negotiations of any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company.

## How We Protect Your Personal Information

The security of your personal information is important to us. We use reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the personal information we collect. DFIN uses reasonable measures to safeguard personally identifiable information from loss, theft, misuse, alteration and unauthorized access or destruction. In addition, we maintain appropriate physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your personal data, including:

  * Restricting access to personal data to our employees or service providers on a “need to know” basis;
  * Enforcing policies and procedures for our employees in their handling of personal data; and
  * Using technologies designed to safeguard data during its transmission, such as SSL encryption for the data you provide on some parts of our site and using appropriate security to safeguard the data that we have received.



DFIN also employs industry-standard measures and processes for detecting and responding to inappropriate attempts to breach our systems.

There is, however, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage that can be 100% secure. Therefore, DFIN cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information. The Internet by its nature is a public forum, and DFIN encourages you to use caution when disclosing information online. Often, you are in the best situation to protect yourself online. You are responsible for protecting your username and password from third party access, and for selecting passwords that are secure.

## How We Monitor and Enforce

DFIN regularly reviews our compliance with our Privacy Notice. We also adhere to several self-regulatory frameworks in addition to complying with applicable laws. If we receive formal written complaints, we will follow up with the person making the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities to resolve any complaints that cannot be resolved directly.

## Compliance With Other Regulations

DFIN adheres to US and other international regulations such as PIPEDA and the European Union (“EU”) General Data Regulation 2016/679.

## PIPEDA (Canada)

DFIN recognizes and has controls in place to ensure that the privacy of personal information about an “identifiable individual” used in the course of “commercial activity” is protected and managed in such a manner which meets or exceeds the guidelines set out in PIPEDA and applicable provincial legislation.

## Data Transfer and Privacy Shield Framework

DFIN is a global organization with legal entities and business processes in operation across borders. DFIN complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss–U.S Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal data transferred from the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom (UK) and Switzerland to the United States, respectively.

DFIN has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the [Privacy Shield Principles](https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework) of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, Recourse, Enforcement and Liability.

With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, DFIN is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the United States Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, DFIN may disclose EU, UK and Swiss personal data as necessary in connection with the sale or transfer of all or part of its business, where required or permitted by law, where DFIN believes that such disclosures are appropriate in connection with a law enforcement request or as otherwise permitted by the Privacy Shield Principles, or in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities or suspected fraud or in order to comply with, enforce or apply DFIN agreements.

In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, DFIN commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal data at no cost to the individual.

DFIN will respond to your inquiry within 45 days.

In the event of a reported complaint that DFIN does not resolve itself, DFIN commits to cooperate with the EU Data Protection Authorities (DPAs), UK Information Commissioner (ICO) and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) and comply with the advice given by the EU DPA panel, or UK ICO or Swiss Commissioner with regard to human resource and non-human resource data transferred from the EU, UK and Switzerland to DFIN in the United States (US).
