<strong>What Information We Collect and For What Purposes</strong>
</p><p>
To most effectively offer our services, we may collect information from you in the following ways:
</p><ul>

	<li><strong>Cookies</strong>. When you browse to www.rrdiscovery.com, our system sends a small file called a cookie to your computer that identifies your browser. This allows us to recognize you for purposes of saving your preferences or providing personalized service. We use cookies to record session information, record user-specific information on what pages users access or visit, or customize Web page content based on visitors browser type or other information that the visitor sends. Since we use cookies to make your web site visit more user friendly, please be aware that refusing cookies may not allow you to take full advantage of some our web site features.</li>
