## Personal information

Personal information is information that can be used to identify you. It can include your name, date of birth, email address, postal address, telephone number, fax number and credit/debit card details. 

We collect personal information when you ask about our activities, register with us (for example, registering with the online shop), order products and services (such as publications and email newsletters), make a donation to us, or otherwise give us personal information.

### How do we use your information?

We use your personal information to give you the information, services, or products you ask for. We can also use your information for administrative purposes, to let you know about changes and, if you agree, as part of our fundraising activities. We sometimes also share your information with our service providers, trading companies, and associated organisations (who work with us to get the information you ask for). 

RNIB is responsible for collecting your personal information. Your personal information is not shared with third parties or used in any other way (other than described in this policy or as required by law) unless you agree. 

Where indicated - usually by a tick box asking for your permission - we use your personal information to create a profile of your interests and preferences. This information is not shared with other organisations. 

We reserve the right to share your personal information if we are legally obliged to and to enable us to apply our terms and conditions and other agreements. This includes exchanging information with other organisations for fraud and credit risk reduction. 

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet is 100 per cent secure. As a result, while we try to protect your personal information, RNIB cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. When we collect your personal information we use strict procedures and security features to prevent unauthorised access.

### Cookies

RNIB uses "cookies" to give you a better website. For more information, read about [cookies on RNIB's website](https://web.archive.org/about-rnib/cookies).

### Privacy and comments on our blogs

The posting of personal information in a blog comment means your information is publicly accessible. Such information can be viewed online and collected by third parties. We are not responsible for the use of information by such third parties. We strongly recommend you avoid sharing any personal information that can be used to identify you (such as your name, age, address, name of employer).
