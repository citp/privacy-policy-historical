_**How does the Privacy amendments affect my RP Data services?**_  
According to advice from our solicitors and information from the Privacy Commissioner's office, the implications of the Privacy changes are that we will have some changes, but nothing substantial that you, the subscriber, will notice. However, there are obligations that you (the subscriber), will need to comply with.

**_What do I have to agree to do to access RP Data's services?_**  
We will ask you, upon entering the data information services area, to acknowledge that you are bound by the provisions of the Privacy Act and will comply with this at all times. This will now form part of your contract. If you do not agree to this, you will not be allowed to access the system. We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause.

_**How will this affect the information I collect?**_  
Under the Privacy Act, when you are gathering information from your clients, for input into one of RP Data's systems, we require that you have obtained the necessary approvals from your client for the use of their personal information. Again, before uploading this to our systems, we will again ask you have you complied with the Privacy Act.

These privacy compliance screens will only appear once, upon first time entry to the system. However your obligations will continue with respect of privacy compliance if you continue using information sourced from our services, even if you cease subscribing to our services.
