### More about our cookies

#### Our own cookies

We use cookies to make our website work including:

  * Making our shopping basket and checkout work
  * Providing access to CPD/Revalidation ePortfolio
  * Determining if you are logged in or not
  * Allowing you to add comments to our site
  * Other membership benefits, including access to online journals, TOG and BJOG

Disabling these cookies will likely break the functions offered by these third parties.

#### Anonymous visitor statistics cookies

We use cookies to compile visitor statistics, such as how many people have visited our website, what type of technology they are using (e.g. Mac or Windows, which helps to identify when our site isn’t working as it should for particular technologies), how long they spend on the site, what page they look at etc. This helps us to continuously improve our website. These ‘analytics’ programs also tell us, on an anonymous basis, how people reached this site (e.g. from a search engine) and whether they have been here before, helping us to put more money into developing our services for you, rather than marketing.

To do this, we use Google Analytics.
