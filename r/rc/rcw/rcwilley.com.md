# R.C. Willey Home Furnishings. One Place, So Many Possibilities!

We at R.C. Willey hold the privacy of our visitors and customers in the highest regard. In the following sections, we hope to answer all of your questions regarding the information we collect, how we use that information, and the control you have over your information.

  
We collect two types of information about you, personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information, both of which are controllable by you.

The personally identifiable information we collect relates to information that you willingly provide to us such as name, address, and other account information necessary to process a transaction or survey. R.C. Willey also offers its customers an online Shopper's Club. This Shopper's Club is an opt-in Shopper's Club, meaning customers only receive emails and information if they sign up to receive it. Of course, just as customers can opt-in to the Shopper's Club, customers can also opt-out.

The non-personally identifiable information we collect relates to the information associated with your computer's interaction with our Web server such as browser types and IP addresses. Such information is typically used in aggregate form. This information allows us to analyze Web site usage and, subsequently, improve our site, your browsing and shopping experience, and our offerings to you.

  
R.C. Willey does not exchange, rent, reveal or sell personally identifiable information about its customers to any third parties (other than regulatory authorities and law enforcement officials in accordance with applicable laws). At the same time, we work diligently to protect your information and seek to use the latest web technologies to provide you with a safe and private online experience.

With regard to your purchases, we utilize your personal information only in an effort to fulfill the sale and delivery of the product or service purchased and to track aggregate information pertaining to sales and marketing. With regard to our Shopper's Club, we utilize your information only in an effort to fulfill the distribution of our Shopper's Club.

With regard to non-personal information such as IP address, we, as stated above, use this information in aggregate form in order to analyze the usage of our Web site and to improve upon your customer experience.

With regard to personally identifiable information, you have the option to remove all such information or discontinue your participation in our Shopper's Club. This can be accomplished by making the appropriate changes within your online account or by responding to our Shopper's Club using the appropriate method.

With regard to non-personally identifiable information, there are software programs available that can assist you in establishing a more 'anonymous' presence on the Internet.

  
If we have not sufficiently addressed your questions or you have additional questions, please contact us.
