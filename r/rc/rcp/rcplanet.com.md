**R/C Planet Privacy Statement**

R/C Planet is a firm believer in the protection of its online customers' privacy. We have implemented a number of procedures and policies which are designed to protect your personal information while using our online services. 

R/C Planet has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this site. 

Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect visitor's contact information (like their names, address, telephone number and e-mail address) and financial information (like their account or credit card numbers). Contact information from the order form is used to send orders and information about our company to our customers. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services. If you choose a third-party billing option, financial and personal information will be provided to the billing company. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Our site uses "cookies" to keep track of your shopping cart. 

  * Whenever sensitive personal or financial information is transmitted, it is sent via a [secured connection](https://www.thawte.com/core/process?process=public-site-seal-cert-details&public-site-seal-cert-details.referer=http://www.rcplanet.com/Privacy_Statement.htm) directly to our mainframe computer using secure sockets layer (SSL) technology. This is the most successfully used method of ensuring private, secure transmission of personal information over the Internet. 
  * Our online systems do not relay or retransmit your information insecurely to other computers--when you send personal information using our online ordering system, it is directly passed to our secure servers. 
  * E-mail addresses are collected only for the purpose of contacting you in the future. We WILL NOT sell or rent your e-mail address to other companies or individuals. 
  * Any questions concerning this Privacy policy can be directed to email - clint@rcplanet.com 
  * We have contracted with Overture services to monitor certain pages of our site for reporting statistics. Overture may use cookies or other methods to compile anonymous statistics. No personally identifiable data is collected by or transferred to Overture. For more information about how this information is used, please see [Overture’s privacy policy](http://www.content.overture.com/d/USm/about/company/privacypolicy.jhtml).
