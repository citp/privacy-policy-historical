## Personal Information

#### How do we use your personal information?

We use personal data to assist in the query, application and admissions process and to provide this information securely to regulatory or funding bodies related to student applications. When we collect personally identifiable information through our website, we will make it clear that we are doing so. We will also make it clear what personal information we will collect, and what we intend to do with it.

Where you have voluntarily given personal information to the RCA for a specific service such as: internal record keeping; student admissions service Alumnet or to obtain an alumni membership card, we will only use it for the purpose for which it has been gathered. For more information, please contact [webmaster@rca.ac.uk](mailto:webmaster@rca.ac.uk).

#### What personal information might we collect?

When individuals register for any of our services: to subscribe to newsletters, make purchases, make an enquiry or report a problem, they may be asked to voluntarily provide personal information such as name, address, telephone number or e-mail address.

Online purchases through our websites will always be made through WorldPay, a secure payment platform, and donations via BlackBaud Payments Services, so credit or debit card details will not be held or used directly by RCA.

#### Direct Marketing

Subscribers to newsletters or email lists may be contacted when we promote programmes of study or events that may be of interest. Anyone may at any time request us to stop using their personal data for direct marketing purposes by contacting: [media@rca.ac.uk](mailto:media@rca.ac.uk).

#### Alumni Engagement Programme

Alumni who submit their details may be contacted by the RCA Alumni Relations programme to advertise Alumni events and services. We will also from time to time publicise the names of those alumni for whom we no longer hold contact details to other alumni, in hope of reconnecting with them.

#### Directories

If anyone voluntarily submits personal data for inclusion in any RCA directory or information service, it may be seen by anyone else who has access to that directory or service. People should not submit any personal data that they do not want to be made public in this way, and no one should send any personal data about anyone else without their express permission.
