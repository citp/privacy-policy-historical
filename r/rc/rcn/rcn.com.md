# RCN Legal - Privacy Policy

**RCN Privacy Policy**   
  
RCN understands how important personal privacy is to you and we are committed to fully protect your rights. We want our customers to be aware of what information RCN collects and how it is handled. This statement discloses RCN's privacy practices, including an explanation of which personally identifiable information about RCN's customers is collected, how the information is used, with whom the information may be shared, and how the customer can correct any inaccuracies in the information.  


Personal Information |  Collection of Information |  Use of Information |  Exceptions |  Editing of Information |  Links to Other Web Sites |  Revision of this Policy

**I. PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION & AUTONOMOUS INFORMATION **

To provide reliable, quality services RCN must gather and collect certain information, both personally identifiable and autonomous, regarding its customers and potential customers. 

_A. Personally Identifiable Information_

Some of the information that RCN collects contains details about the person who provides it that is "personally identifiable." Personally identifiable information, includes, but is not limited to, names (and spouse's name), street addresses, telephone numbers, identification numbers (such as driver's license and/or social security number), credit card numbers and similar types of information identifying the person to whom such information belongs. For example, RCN collects personally identifiable information when customers apply for or change service, or when RCN answers questions about the company and its services, in any face-to-face meeting, telephone discussion, delivered correspondence or use of RCN's services over the RCN Network. RCN uses personally identifiable information (i) for the stated purpose for which such information is gathered; (II) for marketing and sales purposes, (III) for billing and collection purposes; ( IV ) for provisioning, installing, auditing and maintaining service; ( V ) for legal, financial, accounting and tax record keeping; (VI) for other RCN business purposes associated with its services and ( VII ) requirements imposed by governmental authorities. 

RCN does not specifically collect personal information from children. Therefore we ask children to obtain the consent of their parent or guardian before providing us with any personal information. 

_B. Autonomous Information_

RCN also collects information that is said to be "autonomous" over the RCN Network. IP addresses and information collected via "Cookies" are examples of autonomous information. Autonomous Information includes cached information (see II.E. "Customer Communication and Web Navigation"). Autonomous information does not contain specific details about the identity of the person who provides it. Rather, the RCN Network automatically gathers certain usage and other information for use in the aggregate to monitor the RCN Network and services, to improve service offerings and for targeted advertising. Aggregated data is compiled into statistical and demographic information that RCN uses, and may share with others, to show preferences of its customer base as a whole, but not the preferences of any individual customers. Shared aggregated data does not include a level of detail that will permit anyone to identify an individual customer's usage or preferences. 

**II. RCN'S COLLECTION OF INFORMATION**

_A. Registration for Services/Service Orders_

RCN is actively engaged in face-to-face sales, direct marketing and telemarketing. Personally identifiable information is collected through these methods in order for RCN to register and qualify customers to receive the RCN services. The information that RCN receives is fed into RCN's provisioning and billing systems to enable RCN to deliver and manage the services that a customer orders. 

RCN assures you that any face-to-face, telephone or on-line inquiry or registration for services (Service Order) that is submitted to RCN will be treated in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Statement and Policy. 

_B. RCN Web Sites_

RCN currently operates several web sites. Each of these web sites not only provides information relating to the various RCN companies and services, but provides a potential customer with the opportunity to request information about or to subscribe to the particular RCN services on-line. 

The RCN sites also contain links to web sites that are not affiliated with RCN that may or may not have similar practices in place to protect the privacy of information that you supply. RCN encourages everyone to review the privacy statements of each of the sites that are linked to or accessed from RCN's web site so that there will be no surprise as to how each visited site collects, uses and distributes information. 

_C. Co-Branded Web Sites and Services_

Generally, all personally identifiable information that RCN collects at any of its web sites or when you speak to an RCN representative is maintained solely by RCN in accordance with this privacy statement. In an effort to provide a diversity of service selections, RCN from time-to-time teams up with unaffiliated companies, for example in a co-branded web site. If information will be collected or maintained by any company other than RCN, that other company's privacy policy will govern the treatment of information. Where possible, RCN requires that such parties treat such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

_D. Service Records_

RCN's telephone switch equipment automatically collects data (call records) relating to the originating and terminating telephone numbers involved in each telephone call carried over the RCN Network, the date, time and duration of the call, the applicable billing rate, among other types of information that allows RCN to work with other telephone and wireless networks to route a call and to permit billing of the call. 

RCN's cable television headend equipment collects data relating to programming selections, including pay-per-view selections and signal quality for billing purposes, and may be shared with programmers and program guide providers for marketing and audit purposes and to measure viewership and customer satisfaction. RCN may electronically test the video delivery system from time-to-time to determine whether customers are being properly billed for the cable service they receive. RCN technical support may also remotely query your computer for information to remotely trouble shoot and to assist diagnosing a problem that might affect the computer attached to the RCN cable modem product. 

All bills are mailed at regular intervals to the billing address indicated in a Service Order to the attention of the account holder only. RCN customer service representatives, credit and collections representatives and billing personnel have access to the billing systems where the call record and/or billing information is compiled in order to perform the billing function, answer questions relating to billing and to collect on overdue accounts RCN may monitor and/or record telephone calls placed to an RCN customer service and support center for quality assurance and training purposes. Third party verification services, which are independent from RCN, often record follow-up calls to verify sales made by RCN telemarketers. RCN also keeps records relating to complaints about customer on-line behavior, contacts with RCN customer service and support representatives and reports of account holder violations of our Internet Access Agreement. RCN keeps track of service tickets that are opened in response to reports of service disruption and RCN customer service representatives may note your account whenever you place a service call. 

_E. Customer Communications and Web Navigation_

RCN does not monitor the content of any on-line communication (electronic mail (e-mail) or chat conversations). Should any personally identifiable or sensitive information be disclosed while engaged in on-line correspondence or chat that there is the risk of having the person(s) to whom the information is addressed collect and use it. One should also be mindful that people might be logged into a public chat room without a discloser's knowledge and take personally identifiable and sensitive information. RCN assumes no responsibility for or control over any such third persons. Information posted in chat rooms and newsgroups that RCN operates are deleted on average every third day to clear posted messages. E-mail is deleted from RCN's server once it is downloaded to a customer's computer. 

RCN does not monitor anyone's travel on the World Wide Web. The RCN Network automatically logs certain information that is used (1) by the RCN Abuse Department to ensure that all use of the RCN Internet access service is in accordance with the RCN Internet Access Agreement and Acceptable Use Policy and (2) in the aggregate, to understand how efficiently the RCN Network is operating and being used so that RCN's Network Engineers can make improvements in the quality of the service. The logs are maintained on RCN's web servers for approximately sixty (60) days before being deleted, but the logs are sometimes deleted at shorter intervals if disk space requirements dictate. Further, RCN does not maintain Internet Protocol or Universal Resource Locator [URL] information for purposes of connecting to individual subscribers and automatically purges such information, as indicated above, for the subscriber's protection and privacy. 

As is common practice in our industry, RCN uses Web caching software on its network to ensure optimum performance for our customers. Such software by its nature captures Internet Protocol and Universal Resource Locator information to a log file. It is RCN's policy not to monitor the captured information or share it with any external entity, e.g., to build user preference profiles. However, such information may be used in the following instances: 

(1) In the event RCN is served with a Subpoena, Court Order or other legal instrument, requiring the production of such records, and; 

(2) RCN's Network Engineers may use this information in the aggregate, to understand how efficiently the RCN Network is operating so that they can make improvements in the quality of the service. 

These logs are maintained on RCN's web servers for approximately sixty (60) days before being deleted, but can be deleted at shorter intervals if disk space requirements dictate. 

_F. Cookies_

Cookies are small text files that are utilized to enable a continuous connection to web sites, making it more convenient to visit pages within a web site without the need to download the web site each time. Cookies will only contain information that a user may choose to volunteer. Cookies are meant to assist the user to visit a web site in a seamless fashion. Cookies are particularly useful in facilitating Web transactions that span multiple pages, e.g., making travel arrangements, online banking, Internet shopping. 

Some of the RCN web sites allow customers to perform self-care on their accounts. When the individual successfully logs into the RCN web server, it will place a Cookie containing an identifier on the customer's hard disk. As the customer transmits each subsequent page of self-care information to the server, the server will ask the individual's computer for the Cookie to confirm the individual's identity without requiring the individual to login each time. The Cookie will not run any programs, will not carry viruses to or cause malfunction of a computer. The Cookie will only be read by RCN's web server and used to expedite customer login in the self-care process. 

The "help" portion on the toolbar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new Cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you are to receive a new Cookie, or how to disable Cookies altogether. However, as Cookies allow your user experience to be enhanced, and expedite login in RCN's self care process, we recommend that you leave them turned on. 

_G. Data Retention_

RCN's Corporate Policy for data retention pertaining to its customer's Personally Identifiable Information is for the life of the account, plus an additional five (5) years. Autonomous Information is retained by RCN for a period of up to five to (5) years. 

**III. RCN'S USE OF INFORMATION**

RCN is committed to the confidential treatment of all personally identifiable information that it receives from you, both on computer servers, physically or otherwise, and secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use and disclosure in secure environments. To this end, we use industry-standard methods such as firewalls, encryption and system access controls, and our security practices are regularly reviewed against industry best practices by internal staff and independent third parties. However, as no computer or network-based product exists that can provide "perfect security", RCN can not guarantee your information is completely risk-free. Furthermore, you should be aware that any information you include in a message you post to a chat room, forum or other public posting area is available to anyone with Internet access. 

Except as otherwise noted herein, all personally identifiable information that RCN collects when you inquire about or sign up for service (or begin the inquiry or sign-up process, whether you complete the process or not) is used only for the normal business purpose of offering and rendering RCN services to you. It is accessible by RCN employees, contractors, vendors and installation/sales agents to the extent necessary for RCN to install, market, sell, provide and monitor the technical operability of the RCN Network and/or services. RCN also provides access to personally identifiable information to the extent required for the tax, accounting, legal and other professionals hired by RCN to fulfill their fiduciary or representative duty. All such professionals are bound to maintain the confidentiality of information supplied to them by contractual or ethical obligations. Personally identifiable information about video service customers may also be provided to building owners and agents, auditors, program guide providers, program services for marketing and audit purposes and to representatives of a franchising authority to demonstrate material compliance with the terms of RCN's operating franchises when appropriate, subject to applicable law. The frequency with which information is accessed will vary with RCN's business needs. 

**IV. EXCEPTIONS**

RCN will consider personally identifiable information that is collected and kept about any person to be confidential and will disclose it to a third party only if (i) the discloser consents in advance in writing or electronically; (ii) disclosure is necessary to render the RCN services and to perform related business activities expressed in this privacy statement (See Section III); (iii) disclosure is required pursuant a request for specific customer information to comply with a Subpoena, Court Order, and/or other legal instrument, legal proceeding or relevant law, specifically as it pertains to the US Patriot Act; or (iv) there is an immediate, imminent threat to the safety of any person, RCN or the RCN Network. Upon a customer's act of submitting such information to RCN, the customer acknowledges and agrees to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Statement and Policy, and the customer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless RCN, its parent company, agents, employees and subsidiaries, from and against any and all claims, loss, damage, cost or expense (including attorney's fees) to the extent such claims directly arise as a result of actions taken by RCN pursuant to the provisions described under the within Privacy Statement and Policy. 

RCN will not sell or provide lists containing personally identifiable customer information to unaffiliated third parties in the normal operation of its business. RCN, however, does reserve the right to provide customer lists and related information in connection with any contemplated sale of the company or all or part of the business assets used to provide any RCN service to which the customers on a list subscribe and to treat RCN customer information as a business asset in the event of bankruptcy or liquidation. 

**V. EDITING OF INFORMATION**

RCN provides the right for any person to inspect and request correction of any error in RCN's records relating to the personally identifiable information that we maintain about him/her. In certain instances, under Federal law, the right may be enforced in a civil action. If anyone wishes to inspect his/her records, please contact RCN by mail or telephone, providing sufficient time for RCN to locate and, if necessary, prepare the information for review, and to arrange an appointment for viewing at our local business office, during RCN's normal business hours.
