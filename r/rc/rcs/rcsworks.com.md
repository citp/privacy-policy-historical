# RCS Privacy Policy

RCS respects the privacy of its web site visitors and customers. This document explains the types of information RCS gathers via the internet and how that information is used. 

## Web Site Visitors

Visitors may view and use the rcsworks.com web site without providing any personal information. 

## RCS Clients

As part of doing business with its clients, RCS maintains a database of "contact information" such as name, title, address, corporate ownership, telephone numbers and e-mail addresses. Clients may also be asked certain questions about other software or computer systems they use, consulting services they employ and the nature of those services. This information is shared internally among RCS personnel only to the extent necessary to provide RCS products, systems and services. This information is never disclosed or marketed to any third parties. 

## Internet Information

There are two types of information RCS collects via the internet: (1) "user" information such as names and e-mail addresses, and (2) "computer" information such as IP addresses and database names. 

### (1) User Information

The rcsworks.com web site may collect information when a user requests access to restricted areas or when downloading files. It may also be requested by RCS staff during telephone or fax communications. Such disclosure of personal information is solely at the discretion of the customer. Personal information includes name, alias or “on-air” name, personal or cell phone number, e-mail address, the language(s) spoken by the person, their affiliations with various RCS clients and the date and time of their last contact with RCS.

Visitors to restricted areas of the rcsworks.com web site are identified by their e-mail address. If a visitor does not wish to disclose the e-mail address, an alternative RCS-assigned user name may be provided. RCS agrees to remove from its databases any personal information a user wishes to revoke. Depending on the nature of information removed, RCS may be unable to authorize the user from obtaining software releases or product licenses. 

### (2) Computer Information

RCS provides several internet-based customer services: Licensing, Update, Data Exchange and Bug Reporting. 

#### Internet Licensing

Through its “Internet Licensing” system, RCS collects some technical information about the computers that connect to RCS servers. This information includes IP addresses, RCS-issued User IDs and passwords, operating and file system versions, RCS product version numbers and the names and call letters of all the RCS product databases installed on the machines. This information is only collected when the end user initiates a licensing dialog with RCS and is never initiated by RCS. This information does not include any user-input contents of such databases nor any non-RCS products, files, services or systems installed or connected to the user’s computers. RCS collects only the minimally necessary set of RCS product parameters required to authorize the use of RCS software and systems within the terms of the user’s contract with RCS. All licensing transactions and IP addresses are logged. 

#### Internet Update

Through its “Internet Update” system, RCS collects some technical information about the software versions of RCS products installed on the user’s computer. This information is used to determine the nature of any new software or modules that should be downloaded by the user and automatically applied to the RCS software installation. This information is only collected when the end user initiates an Internet Update dialog with RCS and is never initiated by RCS. Version information may be used to update RCS records of installed software at the user’s site.

####  Data Exchange

Through its Data Exchange service, RCS collects the contents of the user’s product database for transmission to the RCS server. This collection is only done when initiated by the end user. The database name and call letters are collected, as well as the e-mail address of the sender and recipient(s). This information is used only to notify the recipient(s) of the database transmission. RCS does not send unsolicited mail to Data Exchange recipient addresses nor disclose the addresses to third parties including other recipients. The user is encouraged to make use of the Private Password to encrypt the data and prevent access by unauthorized parties. In all cases the contents of the database sent to the RCS server are destroyed after seven days.

####  Internet Bug Reporting

Through its “Internet Bug Reporting” feature, RCS collects technical information about the operating system, free disk space and software versions of RCS products installed on the user’s computer(s). The user is asked to provide a description of the problem, an e-mail address and business mailing address. At the user’s option, the information sent to RCS may include the full contents of the selected product database and/or so- called “debug” files (which contain a log of specific actions taken by the software and its users). Databases and debug files are never collected without the user’s consent and only when initiated by the user. 

### Aggregated Information

RCS may collect aggregate information about its web site visitors, such as IP addresses and HTTP Referrers. This information does not contain any personally identifying information. RCS uses this information to monitor and improve the performance of its web sites. 

### Abuse

RCS offers its internet services as a courtesy to its customers. Services may be suspended or discontinued for some or all users at any time, for any reason, including as a result of abuse or where security of the systems or customer data is at risk. 

### Use of Personal Information

RCS uses names and e-mail addresses to control access to certain parts of the rcsworks.com web site. RCS may send mail to the e-mail addresses in the database for the purposes of announcing product news, conducting surveys or providing support, order tracking or licensing information. RCS provides a method for users to set their preferences regarding the types of e-mail sent. RCS stores preferences with the e-mail address and makes diligent efforts to avoid sending unwanted e-mail. RCS may make use of a person’s title or affiliation for the purpose of targeting certain types of messages. RCS reserves the right to utilize e-mail to contact any customer regarding the status of their accounts or service agreements.

 _RCS does not disclose personal information to third parties._

RCS makes diligent efforts to ensure that the personal and computer information of its clients remains secure. RCS does not use customer or person names or other identifying details on its web site, or in any file download, product release or internet dialog, for any purposes other than official RCS business with the customer. While RCS exercises all precautions regarding the security of its internal information, the nature of certain internet communications cannot be regarded as absolutely secure.  
RCS makes use of various mechanisms to ensure the contents of its product databases may only be accessed by authorized users, and internally by RCS personnel. RCS maintains the confidentiality of all customer communications, including database contents, program settings, personnel and facility information.

### Cookies

Cookies are small files containing evidence of a previous visit to a web site. The information stored in a cookie from a web site can only be read by the web site that stored it. Cookies cannot access data from parts of the user’s computer other than cookies.

RCS uses cookies to keep track of logged-in users and offer customized pages and other services based on their identity. These cookies do not contain any personally identifying information. RCS offers the convenience of storing the user’s identity (currently comprised of their e-mail address and RCS password) in a second cookie, which avoids the need of logging into the rcsworks.com web site at each visit. Use of this second cookie is optional and created only with the user’s consent.

Cookies are used to store the user’s Name, E-mail Address and Company name on their computer for use by the E-mail Direct page to display the most recently entered information for these fields.

RCS provides a means to remove all cookies it has set by visiting this web page: <http://www.rcsworks.com/services/nocookies.asp> 

### IP Addresses

An IP address is assigned to each computer connected to the internet. IP addresses can at times be used to identify ISPs and internet domains. RCS may collect IP addresses for diagnostic and statistical purposes. RCS may choose to block certain IP addresses given any evidence of abuse of its web services or to ensure the integrity and security of its web services.

## Children

In accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, RCS does not knowingly solicit information from children on its web site, nor does it market its services to children. Additionally, no part of the public RCS web site shall contain any information that could be regarded as inappropriate for children.
