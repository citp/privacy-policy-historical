## Email tracking.

Some emails that we send you have no tracking in at all e.g. service emails with invoices attached. Other emails we send may contain tracking so that we can tell how much traffic those emails send to our site. We do not know who has clicked so the data is anonymous.

Some emails we can track, at an individual level, such as whether the user has opened and clicked on the email. We rarely use the information at a personal level, rather we use it to understand open and click rates on our emails to try and improve them. If you want to be sure that none of your email activity is tracked then you should opt out of our emails which you can do via the unsubscribe link at the bottom of each email.

## Social buttons.

On many of the pages of the site you will see 'social buttons'. These enable users to share or bookmark the web pages. For example there are buttons for: Twitter, Google+, and Facebook. In order to implement these buttons, and connect them to the relevant social networks and external sites, there are scripts from domains outside of our website.

You should be aware that these sites are likely to be collecting information about what you are doing all around the internet, including on this site. In some cases these sites will be registering the fact that you are visiting our website, and the specific pages you are on, even if you don't click on the button if you are logged into their services, like Google and Facebook.

You should check the respective policies of each of these sites to see how exactly they use your information and to find out how to opt out, or delete, such information.

## Social Plugins.

On some pages within the site we use 'social plugins'. These enable you to utilize your existing Facebook account to login to the site or post comments. They are there to enhance your experience and make interacting with the site easier. In order to implement these plugins, and connect them to the relevant social networks and external sites, there are scripts from domains outside of our website.
