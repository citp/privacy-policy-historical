# the Prepaid Visa RushCard : Security & Privacy

Security and privacy are two of the most important issues to address when we are talking about your money. UniRush Financial Services has built a network that provides the highest level of safety for your personal information and funds. 

Architecture & Security   
The Rush Visa® Card payment platform offers state-of-the-art technology. Fraud prevention and detection are among our foremost priorities, so we use extensive encryption technology throughout our platform. This provides state-of-the-art security for both the transmission and storage of data.

Our architecture was developed to address potential security threats and prevent opportunities for fraudulent behavior. The use of an off site data center to ensure the safety of our data and the integrity of our servers has allowed us to develop a premium architecture to provide a high profile, secure technological environment. In addition to in-house development efforts, our best of breed partners have been carefully selected to create an environment that allows our technologies to provide optimal usability for our users.

When using the internet UniRush automatically encrypts your confidential information using the Secure Sockets Layer protocol (SSL) with an encryption key length of 128-bits. Once your information reaches us, it resides on a server that is protected physically and electronically. All of your private information is available only to authorized computers and not directly connected to the internet.

Only authorized employees are permitted to access customer information and for your safety may request additional information to verify your account.
