# Privacy Policy - RussianBrides.com

Depending on what you do when you visit any Website, you are providing information about your visit to the site's owners. This includes RussianBrides.com. We value privacy and think you do too, so we want you to have the information you need to make your own decisions about your personal privacy. When you visit or supply information to any Website, we think it's a good idea for you to first understand what that site's privacy policies are. If the site doesn't tell you, don't hesitate to ask.

The bottom line at www.RussianBrides.com is that we only use the information that we get from your visit for internal tracking purposes, to make RussianBrides.com as useful and interesting to you as we can, and to respond to your requests for information about Russian girls, Ukrainian brides, or other issues. Except as specifically noted, we do not use your personal information for any other purpose; we never sell it to any third party; and we never share it with any third party.
