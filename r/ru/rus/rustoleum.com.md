**With Whom we share your Personal Data**

We are part of a multinational group of affiliated companies that has databases in different countries, some of which are operated by affiliates and some of which are operated by third parties on behalf of Company or one of our affiliates.  We may transfer your data to one or more such databases outside your country of domicile, potentially including countries which may not require an adequate level of protection for your personal information compared with that provided in your country.  However, Company and its affiliates have established controls as required by applicable law to safeguard the possession of, and transfer of, Personal Data.  The following are examples of how and why your Personal Data may be shared:

Company may share your Personal Data with people within our parent company, subsidiaries and affiliates who have a “need to know” that data for business or legal reasons, for example, in order to carry out an administrative function such as processing an invoice, or to direct a query that you have submitted to the relevant department or affiliate.

We may disclose your Personal Data to third parties including the authorities, Company's advisors, suppliers of IT services and third parties engaged by Company or its affiliates for the purpose of providing services requested by you; to protect any intellectual property rights in any materials displayed on or otherwise available from Company's website; for the purposes of seeking legal or other professional advice; to respond to a legal request or comply with a legal obligation; or to enforce Company's website Terms and Conditions of Use. 

We may disclose your Personal Data to third parties in the event that we sell, buy or merge any business or assets, including to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets.

With your consent, we may disclose your Personal Data to third parties who offer products that may be of interest to you. These companies may then contact you directly with product or sample offers, personalized offers and information or to ask for your feedback on products and programs that may be of interest to you.

Because Company operates globally, and as previously explained, we may share the Personal Data you submit to us with any affiliate anywhere in the world. These entities are required to maintain the confidentiality of your data and are restricted from using it for any purpose other than the purposes set out in this Notice. 

We may decide to allow users to share comments, postings, testimonials, or other information. If you choose to submit such information to us, the information that you submit may be available generally to the public. Information that you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.

Our employees may use personal devices to access our systems containing your Personal Data, thus your Personal Data may be transferred through or to service providers who contract with our employees for cellular data, for example.

We may be required to share your Personal Data in order to comply with a court order, law, or legal process, including to respond to government or regulatory requests.  Disclosure may also be necessary if we have reason to believe that disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action to enforce any of Company’s rights, including against you or a third party, for non-payment, violation of any agreement with us.  We may share your Personal Data to protect the safety of Company, our customers or others; or to prevent injury to or interference with, our rights or property, or the rights or property of other Processors or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.

**Considerations for the Transfers of Personal Data**

Please note that any person to whom Company may disclose your Personal Data under this  Notice may be situated in a country other than your own and that such country may provide a lower level of data protection requirements than your own country. By agreeing to this Notice, you consent to the transfer of your Personal Data to a country other than your own.

As stated above, whenever we transfer Personal Data across borders, we take legally required steps to ensure that adequate safeguards are in place to protect your Personal Data and to make sure it is treated in accordance with this Notice. If you are located in the EEA or the UK, you can request a copy of the safeguards which we have put in place to protect your Personal Data and privacy rights in these circumstances, using the email address provided below.

**Records Retention**

We will keep your personal data for as long as we need it for the purposes set out above, and so this period will vary depending on your interactions with us. For example, where you have made a purchase with us, we will keep a record of your purchase for the period necessary for invoicing, tax and warranty purposes. We may also keep a record of correspondence with you (for example if you have made a complaint about a product) for as long as is necessary to protect us from a legal claim. Where we no longer have a need to keep your information, we will delete it. Please note that where you unsubscribe from our marketing communications, we will keep a record of your email address to ensure we do not send you marketing emails in future.

**Your rights**

Applicable data privacy laws give rights to individuals in respect of Personal Data that organisations hold about them.  If you wish to: 

  * request a copy of the Personal Data that we hold about you; or
