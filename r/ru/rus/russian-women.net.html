our authentication scheme does several checks to ensure the user is who
they claim to be. One of these checks looks at the IP address to
accurately identify The Russian Women Network member.
</p>

<p>
<b>Q:</b> Does The Russian Women Network combine together Personal
Information collected online with personal Information collected offline?
If so, how is this information used by The Russian Women Network?
