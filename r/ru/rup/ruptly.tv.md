## 2\. Website: Processing of your personal Data

Providing this Website requires the processing of personal data to the extent described in section 2.1. In addition, personal data will be processed in the cases described under section 2.4—2.6.

  


### 2.1. Data Processing to Enable the Use of the Website

When you visit our Website, we collect personal data to enable your use (usage data). This includes your IP address and data about the start, end and subject of your use of the Website as well as any identification data (e.g. your login data when you log into a secure area or payment data where your account enables purchases). It also includes technical data transmitted by your browser such as browser type/browser version, the previously visited website (referrer URL), monitor resolution, operating system, if applicable device information (e.g. device type) etc. We process these data for the provision and demand-oriented design of this Website in our legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR). If you would like detailed information on the weighing of interests, please contact one of the addresses given under section 1.

  


### 2.2. User Account

When you register on our Website, we first request that you provide us your e-mail address. By providing it, selecting "I hereby confirm that I have read and accept Privacy Policy" and pressing the "Sign Up" button, you give us the consent to the processing of your personal data for the specific purpose of receiving access to the registered members area of the Website (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR). After the e-mail confirmation procedure, we request that you provide your name, surname, the country you currently reside in and the name of the company you work for (if there is one). This data processing is necessary in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR) and for the purposes of our legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR). If you would like detailed information on the weighing of interests, please contact one of the addresses given under section 1.

It is also possible, that you receive a link to the registration page after receiving an e-mail from our website requested by a member of your team or a colleague. In this case, you will be offered to provide some of the details listed above in a single form. The same conditions will apply.

The registration or the opening of a user account at Ruptly is not possible without providing personal data. You are neither obliged to register with Ruptly nor to provide personal data. If you do not provide us with the required personal data, you may not be able to use the functions of the Website. Otherwise there will be no consequences for you.

It is possible to delete your user account at any time as long as you don’t owe any payments to Ruptly. This can be done by sending a message to one of the persons named in section 1. However, if you have signed up for subscription Plan which implies automatic renewal and regular payments to Ruptly, you should opt out of this automatic renewal first. Your user account will be deleted:

  * in case all payments due to Ruptly in accordance with your Plan are already processed — after you opt out of automatic renewal;
  * in case any payments to Ruptly in accordance with your Plan are pending — after the last pending payment following the request.

  


### 2.3. Downloading Content

In order to download Content from the Website, you need to have a user account (see section 2.2.) and provide us with additional personal data to execute the concluded contract, e.g. billing information. The legal basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1)(b) GDPR. The provision of this personal data is a contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract. If you do not provide us with this personal data it is not possible to execute the contract, which means no Content can be provided.

Consumers that wish to download Content using the Ruptly Pass plan will need to pass the qualification stage. As you will be requested to provide the billing information before the qualification is confirmed, it is possible that Ruptly will have access to it without entering into a contract. In this case, we will keep this information while offering other licensing plans you may qualify for, so that you don’t need to provide the same billing information again. The legal basis in this case are legitimate interests under Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. If you will not agree to any of them and we do not enter into a contract in the end, Ruptly will delete the data provided. More information on types of qualification, Ruptly Pass and Plans or licensing models offered to you by Ruptly is available in our [Terms of Service](https://ruptly.tv/terms-of-service).
