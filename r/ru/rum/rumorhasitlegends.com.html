<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This application (collectively, "This application" or
"we"), under parent company SFG Media Group, LLC, respects the privacy rights of our online users and is
committed to protecting the personal information collected about or provided by
you. We have adopted this Online Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy")
to guide how we store, collect, manage and use the personal information you
provided in connection with the Service .<br>
<br>
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to
information submitted and collected by This application through use of the Service in any way whether on the
Social Networking Site (as defined in the Terms of Use) or otherwise online, but does not apply to information that may be collected
offline or collected through any other method including your use of any web
site This application's affiliated entities may operate. Moreover, this Privacy
Policy applies to the Service, but <b>not</b> to websites maintained by other
companies or organizations to which we may provide links. When you link to
these websites, this Privacy Policy no longer applies. We are therefore not
responsible for the content or activities provided or created on such sites.<br>
<br>
<em>By using and accessing the Service, you
signify your assent to our Online Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this
Privacy Policy, please do not use the Service. We reserve the right to make changes
to this Privacy Policy. If we make a material change to this Privacy Policy, we
will notify you by posting the change in this Privacy Policy and, if necessary,
give you additional choices regarding such change. Please check back from time
to time to ensure that you are aware of these changes. Your continued use of the
Service will signify your acceptance of these changes.</em></p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><em><u><span style="font-style:normal">Information Collected

may obtain information from you through your Service registration, your access and participation in
message boards, comments, etc on the Service; your email of a question to our customer service
desk; or your purchase of a virtual product of any type. Further, we may ask
you for personal information (such as name, phone number, or email address) if you choose to

service). In all such cases, the information provided will not be disclosed to
third parties and will be used solely for the purpose of providing you with the
Service.</p>

own and/or games you may have recently purchased; (v) your interests, websites,
friend information and fan pages; and, (vi) other service-related

demographic information is collected for an activity that also requires
personal information, This application may combine your demographic information with
your personal information. Before providing the Service any email addresses or phone numbers of your friends, you should obtain their consent. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">You may provide us with another person's email address or phone number to
invite that person to participate in the Service, or to provide you with information for use on the Service. This application may but is not

<p class="MsoNormal">

</li></ul>

<p class="MsoNormal">This application will only use the personal information collected
about you from Social Networking Site for the operation of the Service in
accordance with the policies and terms of the social network. This application does
not rent, lease, loan, sell, voluntarily distribute or redistribute your
personal information to any unaffiliated third parties.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This application may use your email address or other personal
information to send you a newsletter, marketing or advertising materials, or service
announcements that tell you about updates to our Privacy Policy, changes in
pricing, changes to our online service or customer service policies, and other
related service changes. This application will not voluntarily disclose this personal
information to unaffiliated third parties for any other purpose. Information
collected either directly from you or from the Social Networking Site is solely
used in the operation of the Service. For example, personal and/or demographic
information collected through one of the activities set forth <b><span style="color:#333333">above</span></b> may be used for our internal
demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the online products and
services we provide you and better meet your needs. Additionally, we may use
information that we collected to ensure that someone who is cheating is
excluded, and to enforce our rights under our Terms of Service.<br>
<br>
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">No matter what method we use to collect information and no
matter how we use that information, we will only collect the information deemed
reasonably necessary to fulfill your online requests and our legitimate
business objectives, and such information will not be provided to any third

our message board, that information can be collected and used by people you do
not know. While we strive to protect those who wish to participate in these
activities, we cannot guarantee the security and privacy of any information
that you post in these areas and you acknowledge this fact.<br>
<br>

<u>Other Disclosure of Your Personal Information</u></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Notwithstanding any other terms of this Privacy Policy, we
may disclose personal information in the good faith belief that we are required
to do so by law, including but not limited to disclosure to law enforcement or
other government officials in connection with an investigation of fraud,
intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may
expose you or us to legal liability.<br>
<br>

or other similar event, customer information may be transferred to This application's
successor or assign, if permitted by and done in accordance with applicable
law.<br>

example, we may say a particular game title's audience is X% female and Y%
male. This data is used to customize the content and advertising of our Service
to deliver better experience for our visitors. It can also help to tailor our
products and services to meet the needs of our customers.<br>

We may send to your web browser, directly or in directly, advertisements you
see when you visit our Service. However, we may allow other companies, called
third party ad servers, to serve advertisements within our Service. This
Privacy Policy does not apply to, and cannot control the activities of, these
other companies. If you want to prevent a third party ad server from sending
or reading cookies on your computer, you must visit the company's web sites
individually and opt-out.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">If you choose not to submit personal information when
requested, you may not be able to use many of the features the Service offers.</p>


<p><u>Passive Means of Information Collection (Cookies, IP addresses, etc.)</u></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cookies</b><br>
We may use cookies in the operation of the Service. A "cookie" is a
small bit of record-keeping information that sites often store on a user's
computer. Cookies are typically used to quickly identify a user's computer and
to "remember" things about the user's visit. For example, we may use
cookies to keep track of your preferences and your username and password. Information
contained in a cookie may be linked to your personal information for this
purpose. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies
are being sent to your computer, although this may affect your ability to use
many of the features of the Service.<br>
<br>
<b>IP Addresses</b><br>
An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is used by computers on the
network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet. Although
we do not generally collect IP addresses, we may collect and use your IP address
when we feel it is necessary to protect our service, websites, customers, or
others.<br>
<br>
If you use the Service, we may collect other unique numbers associated
with a computer's identity on a network.<br>
<br>
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Log Files</b><br>
Other information that may be passively collected by This application is in the form of
logs - files that record website activity, including how many "hits"
a particular web page is getting (a.k.a. "navigational data"). These
entries are generated anonymously, and enable us to gather statistics about
users' browsing habits, assess overall website activity, track interest in
advertised sales, and maintain website security. We also use the log file
entries for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can
constantly improve the online services we provide you. Log files are used
internally only, and may be combined with data collected via cookies to help us
aggregate behavior patterns of registered users.</p>


<p><u>Privacy Policy and Third Party Web Sites, Links, Advertisements and Services</u></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">You should be aware that while you are using our Service,
you may be directed to other sites that are beyond our control and for which we
are not responsible. Additionally, third parties provide advertisements and
offer other products and services to you when you are using our Service, which
may receive your IP address or other technology such as cookies, web beacons
and the like. By using the Service, you consent to such use by third parties
of your personal information, which is subject to the privacy policies of these
third parties.</p>

parties for more detailed information.</p>
