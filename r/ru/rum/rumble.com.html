to Rumble Inc. or Rumble.com as “Rumble”, “our”,
“us” or “we.”</p><p>We
take your privacy seriously. We are providing this Policy to inform
you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and
disclosure of information on our Service. We also want to inform you
about your choices regarding information. If you have any questions
or concerns, please let us know (see “How to contact us”
section below).</p><p>Note
that this Policy may be modified from time to time in our sole
discretion, so check back frequently.</p><a name="s1"></a><h3>1. How we collect information</h3><p>We collect information in three basic ways:</p><ol><li>We collect information that you voluntarily provide to become a
registered User of our Service, and when you use certain aspects of
our Service (e.g., entering an email address on a form to send an
email from your Rumble account).</li><li>We
collect information when you register to join Rumble by logging
into an account that you already have with certain third-party
social networking sites (“SNS”) (including, but not
limited to, Facebook and Twitter) via our Service. For example, our
Service allows you to create an account and login to the Service
using your Facebook account credentials through Facebook Connect. If
you are not currently registered as a User on the Service and you
click on “Sign in Using Facebook,” you will first be
asked to enter your Facebook credentials and then be given the
option to register and join Rumble.</li><li>When
you browse or use our Service, technological tools including “Log
Data” and “Cookies” collect certain information,
as explained in the following section.</li></ol><a name="s2"></a><h3>2. What information we collect and how we use it</h3><ol><li><strong>Personal Information.</strong>
When
you register with us through the Service to become a registered User
of Rumble, we will ask you for certain information about you that
can be used to contact or identify you (“Personal
Information”). Personal Information may include, but is not
limited to, your name, gender, profile photo, free-form biography,
location/hometown, website and email address. If you decide to
create your User account by logging into a SNS via the Service, you
are using the Personal Information you have already provided to the
SNS (such as your “real” name, email address and other
information you make publicly available via the SNS) to create your
User account on our Service; the information we collect may depend
on the privacy settings you have with the SNS, so please consult the
SNS’s privacy and data practices. For example, by using
Facebook Connect, you are allowing Rumble to access the Personal
Information in your Facebook account pursuant to the Facebook Terms
of Use regarding your use of the Service via Facebook.
We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with
your “Non-Identifying Information,” see below) to
provide the Service to you. For example:
<ol><li><strong>Account registration.</strong>
We create your User account for your use of the Service based upon the Personal Information you provide.
</li><li><strong>Communications.</strong>
We use your Personal Information to contact you with Rumble
newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other
information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any
time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from
us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of
the communications or update your “preferences”
information in your account settings. (See “Your choices
regarding information,” below.)
</li><li><strong>Customer service.</strong>
We use your Personal Information to respond to your questions and/or inquiries.
</li><li><strong>Finding friends.</strong>
You also have the option to import your personal contacts (including
email addresses of friend lists via SNS) to the Service so that you
can find your friends on the Service, and your friends can find you
on the Service.
</li><li><strong>Emailing via a Rumble Account.</strong>
As part of the Service, Rumble Users may communicate with other
registered and non-registered Users through use of their Rumble
accounts. Where Users have selected the option of adding one or
more email addresses to an online form, the message they create in
the corresponding template will be sent from Rumble to those email
addresses on their behalf.
</li></ol></li><li><strong>Non-Identifying Information.</strong>
We also collect other information that you provide as part of
registration, the operation, and personalization of your boards on
Rumble that cannot reasonably be used to identify or contact you
(e.g., without limitation, age and individual preferences)
(“Non-Identifying Information”). Certain Non-Identifying
Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information
if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining
your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to
be personally identified or contacted. But the same pieces of
information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are
taken alone or combined only with other Non-Identifying Information
(for example, your viewing preferences) 
We
may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying
Information and aggregate it with information collected from other
Rumble Users to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to
improve the quality and value of the Service and to analyze and
understand how our Service is used. We may also use the combined
information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for
instance to deliver a product to you according to your preferences
or restrictions.
</li><li><strong>Mobile Software.</strong>
Our Mobile Software allows Users to access and use the Service from
their mobile devices. From the Mobile Software, in the event that
our Mobile Software crashes on your mobile device, we will receive
information about your mobile device model, software version and
device carrier, which allows us to identify and fix bugs and
otherwise improve the performance of our Mobile Software.
</li><li><strong>Log Data.</strong>
When you visit the Service, whether as a registered User or a
non-registered User just browsing, our servers automatically record
information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website
(“Log Data”). This Log Data may include information such
as the browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came
to our Service, pages of our Service that you visit, the time spent
on those pages, information you search for on our Service, access
times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to
monitor and analyze use of the Service and the Service’s
technical administration, to increase our Service’s
functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor our
Service to our visitors’ needs. For example, some of this
information is collected so that when you visit the Service again,
it will recognize you and the information could then be used to
serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your
interests. We also use this information to verify that visitors to
the Service meet the criteria required to process their requests.
</li><li><strong>Cookies.</strong>
Like many online services, Rumble uses “cookies” on our
Service to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that
we transfer to your computer or mobile device’s hard disk. We
use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize “persistent”
cookies to save your login information for future logins to the
Service. Second, we utilize “session ID” cookies to
enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how you
interact with the Service and to monitor aggregate usage by Rumble
Users and web traffic routing on the Service. Unlike persistent
cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log
off from the Service and then close your browser.a
You
can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop
accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from
the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you
may not be able to use all portions of the Service or all
functionality of the Service. (See “Your choices regarding
information,” below.)
</li></ol><a name="s3"></a><h3>3. Sharing of your information</h3><ol><li><strong>Rumble Users.</strong>
When you register through the Service and submit Personal Information to
create a profile or visual collection, other Rumble Users will see
your name. If you choose to provide additional Personal Information
in your profile, Rumble Users will see such additional Personal
Information, including, but not limited to, your photo, location,
website and biography. Providing additional Personal Information is
voluntary and should correlate with the degree of interaction you
want to have with Rumble Users. We recommend that you guard and
refrain from disclosing any information you consider sensitive and
confidential.
</li><li><strong>Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information.</strong>
We may share aggregated information that does not include Personal
Information and we may otherwise disclose Non-Identifying
Information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis,
demographic profiling and other purposes. Any aggregated information
shared in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information.
</li><li><strong>Service Providers.</strong>
We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our
Service, to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform
Service-related services (e.g., maintenance services, database
management, web analytics and improvement of the Service’s
features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Service are used.
These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to
perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose
or use it for any other purpose.
</li><li><strong>Social Networking Sites.</strong>
We may share the information in your Rumble account (including your
Personal Information) with the SNSs that you have linked to your
Rumble account. These third parties have access to your Personal
Information only for this purpose (unless the SNS has received your
Personal Information independently of the Service) and not for other
purposes.
<ul><li><strong>Facebook Connect and Twitter.</strong>
We allow Users to link their Facebook and Twitter accounts to our
Service. Users can then post recent activity on our Service back to
their Facebook and Twitter accounts. You will be prompted to decide
whether or not your activity on the Service will be shared and
disclosed on your Facebook/Twitter service. You can disable the
foregoing feature at any time by logging into your profile and
selecting the option to disable Facebook Connect and/or Twitter.
Further, you may be able to edit your privacy settings for the
content that you post which appears on Facebook/Twitter by making
selections in your “Edit Profile” settings via the
Service.
</li></ul></li><li><strong>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement.</strong>
Rumble cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private
parties to enforce and comply with the law. We can disclose any
information about you to government or law enforcement officials or
private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or
appropriate to respond to claims and legal process including, but
not limited to, subpoenas, to protect the property and rights of
Rumble or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any
person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to
pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical or legally actionable
activity.
</li><li><strong>Business Transfers.</strong>
Rumble may sell, divest, transfer, assign, share or otherwise engage in a
transaction that involves, some or all of our assets, including any
or all of the information described in this Policy, in the course of
a corporate divestiture, merger, acquisition, joint venture,
bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or any other similar
transaction or proceeding.
</li></ol><a name="s4"></a><h3>4. Your choices regarding information</h3><p>You have several choices regarding the use of information on our Service:</p><ol><li><strong>Email Communications.</strong>
If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive email
communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions
provided in any of the communications or update your “preferences”
information in your account settings
</li><li><strong>Cookies.</strong>
If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to accept cookies
from our Service for any of the purposes described above, then you
can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop
accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from
the websites you visit. Consult your browser’s technical
information. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be
able to use all portions of the Service or all functionality of the
Service. If you have any questions about how to disable or modify
cookies, please let us know at the contact information provided
below.
</li><li><strong>De-Linking SNS.</strong>
If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to have your SNS
account (e.g., Facebook or Twitter) linked to your Rumble account,
then you may de-link the SNS account in the “preferences”
section in your account settings.
</li><li><strong>Changing or Deleting Your Information.</strong>
All Users may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information
in their User account (including any imported contacts) by
contacting us or by editing their profile via the Service. If you
completely delete all of your Personal Information, then your User
account may become deactivated. We will use commercially reasonable
efforts to honor your request. We may retain an archived copy of
your records as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.
(For more information on how to control your User Content on the
Rumble Service, including information regarding the use and storage
of your User Content, please see the “Sharing Your Content”
section in our <a href="http://rumble.com/s/terms.html">Terms of Service.</a> )
</li></ol><a name="s5"></a><h3>5. Links to other sites and services</h3><p>Our Service contains links to other third-party websites and online
services. If you choose to visit another website or online service by
clicking on a link, you will be directed to that third party’s
website or online service. The fact that we may link to a website or
online service is not an endorsement, authorization or representation
of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of
their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do
not exercise control over third party websites and online services,
and these third parties may place their own cookies or other files on
your computer and collect data or solicit Personal Information and
Non-Identifying Information from you. Other sites and online services
follow different rules regarding the collection, use and/or
disclosure of Personal Information and Non-Identifying Information.
We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the
other websites or online services you visit before providing any
information or using such websites or services.</p><a name="s6"></a><h3>6. How we store and protect information</h3><ol><li><strong>Information Security.</strong>
We care about the security of your information. We use commercially
reasonable safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of
information collected and maintained through the Service. However,
we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you
provide to us or guarantee that information on the Service may not
be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by unauthorized
persons.
</li><li><strong>Phishing.</strong>
Identity theft and the practice currently known as “phishing” are
of great concern to Rumble. Safeguarding information to help
protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not request
your credit card information, login information, or national
identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or
telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit
the Federal Trade Commission’s <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">website</a>.
</li><li><strong>Breach Notification.</strong>
We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the
security, confidentiality, or integrity of stored “personal
data” (as defined in applicable state statutes on security
breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on this
Service in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable
delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law
enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of
the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.
</li><li><strong>International Transfer</strong>
Your information may be transferred to — and maintained on —
computers located outside of your state, province, country or other
governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as
protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside
the United States and choose to provide information to us, Rumble
transfers Personal Information to the United States and processes it
there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your
submission of such information represents your agreement to that
transfer.
</li></ol><a name="s7"></a><h3>7. Advertising Policies</h3><p>We use an outside ad company to display ads on our site. These ads may
contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site,
cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad company, and
we do not have access to this information. To try and bring you
offers that are of interest to you, we have relationships with other
companies that we allow to place ads on our Web pages. As a result of
your visit to our site, ad server companies may collect information
such as your domain type, your IP address and clickstream
information.</p><p>We allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain
anonymous information when you visit our web site. These companies
may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream
information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements
clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other Web
sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services
likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically
use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information.
To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to
opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit <a href="http://networkadvertising.org/">networkadvertising.org</a></p><a name="s8"></a><h3>8. Our policy towards children’s information</h3><p>This Service is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly
collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.
If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has
provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or
she should contact us at 
<script type="text/javascript">edec('PGEgaHJlZj0ibWFpbHRvOnN1cHBvcnRAcnVtYmxlLmNvbSI+c3VwcG9ydEBydW1ibGUuY29tPC9hPg==')</script><a href="mailto:support@rumble.com">support@rumble.com</a>.
If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with
Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files.
