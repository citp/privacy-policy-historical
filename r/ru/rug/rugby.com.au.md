# Privacy Policy | RUGBY.com.au

## Introduction and Scope

The Australian Rugby Union Limited ( **ARU** , 'we', 'us', 'our') respects the privacy of the individuals in relation to whom we collect, use, disclose and hold personal information and is committed to managing personal information in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles ( **APPs** ) under the Privacy Act 1988 (Commonwealth).

This Privacy Policy ( **Policy** ) sets out how we handle your personal information (including the collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information), how you can access and change your information and how you can provide us with feedback or make a complaint.

Where we refer to "Participant(s)" in this Policy we mean any person that, by way of registration or another process, has agreed to be bound by the ARU Constitution, ARU Policies and Codes or any laws, regulations and By-Laws of World Rugby applying from time to time. For the avoidance of doubt, a Participant includes any player (whether amateur or professional), referee, touch judge or other match official, selector, coach, trainer, manager or other team official and any individual involved in the organisation, administration or promotion of Rugby Union including a director, other officer, employee or volunteer of a Rugby Body.

## What information do we collect and how do we collect it?

#### Overview

The ARU will, where possible, collect personal information directly from you. This will be done in accordance with the APPs. We may collect your personal information on paper-based or electronic forms (online), over the phone or when you engage with us on social media or via our website.

As appropriate, we will notify you of the collection of your personal information and tell you why we are collecting it and how we plan to use it, or these things will be obvious at the time when the information is collected.

#### Participants

When you register to become a Participant by way of an ARU Registration Form or online registration platform (i.e. RugbyLink or Interfuse) a record that contains personal information is made by the ARU (or on behalf of the ARU by the club you have registered with). If you are a junior participant, we will collect your personal information from your parent or guardian.

Personal information about Participants is recorded in RugbyLink (the national player registration database) or Interfuse (the player registration database for NSW Premiership Rugby and NSW Suburban Rugby) in addition to the Australian Rugby Customer Relationship Management System, Salesforce.

    * ensure our programs are run safely and you are participating in an appropriate competition;
    * record and collate injury history, medications and supplement use for professional and semi-professional players through an athlete data management system in accordance with the ARU Medical Policy and ARU Sports Supplements Policy (and equivalent policies for the National Rugby Championship, Super Rugby U20s, Uni Sevens Series, Australian School Boys Championships and other ARU competitions);

#### Prospective employees, interns and applicants

We may collect personal information when recruiting personnel such as your name, contact details, qualifications and work history. Generally, we will collect this information directly from you.

In such situations, this information would typically include your name, contact details, professional details and information regarding interactions with the ARU. This information is collected for the purpose of administration, management and operation of the ARU and its programs.

The information we collect is held in multiple systems including local storage, cloud based and third-party systems (such systems may have data storage facilities offshore).

## How secure is your personal information?

The ARU will also take reasonable steps to protect your personal information from misuse, loss and unauthorised access, modification, interference or disclosure. Your information shall be protected either at the ARU or in overseas storage facilities. However, as the internet is not a secure environment, any information you send us via that method is sent at your own risk.

Our website may contain links which enable you to access other websites. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of those sites.

We will take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify personal information if it is no longer needed for any legitimate purpose. This requirement does not apply where the information is contained in a Commonwealth record or where we are required by law or a court/tribunal order to retain the information.

## How can you ensure that the personal information we hold about you is accurate?

The ARU takes all reasonable precautions to ensure that the personal information we collect, use and disclose is accurate, complete and up-to-date. However, we rely on the accuracy of personal information as provided to us both directly and indirectly.

If you find that the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate, incomplete or out-of-date, please contact us immediately (our contact details are at the conclusion of this Policy) and we will take reasonable steps to ensure that it is corrected (including, if it is practicable to do so, taking reasonable steps to correct information disclosed to third parties).
