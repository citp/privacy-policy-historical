# Privacy Policy

The Australian Rugby Union Limited (ARU) respects the privacy of the individuals on whom the ARU collects, uses, discloses and holds personal information. The ARU has a Privacy Policy that is based on the Australian Privacy Policy Principles contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).

The ARU uses the information it collects to administer the game of Rugby Union in Australia, to provide Rugby activities and Rugby-related services, to register, select and insure participants, and to assess the level of interest in the sport. We may also disclose your information to our Members (including without limitation the Super Rugby Licensees and the State and Territory Unions) to enable them to promote and administer the game of Rugby Union in their area and provide rugby activities and rugby-related services.

The ARU also uses your information to provide information, materials and promotions relating to the ARU and to Rugby Union which the ARU considers may interest you. Where you consent, we may also disclose that information to our sponsors (to enable them to provide information, materials and promotional opportunities) and to certain other third parties.
