THE Rugnrug.COM COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY  
   Our Privacy Policy was developed as an extension of our commitment to combine the highest-quality products and services with the highest level of integrity in dealing with our clients and partners. The Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect, use and safeguard the personal information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our Web Site. This statement will be continuously assessed against new technologies, business practices and our customers' needs.

**WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?**

Your non-identifiable information may be disclosed to others and permanently archived for future use.
