Information We Collect and How We Use It 

Individuals may choose to provide personal information (such as name, contact details and payment information) through this website, in our Stores and through our customer service line. Here are the ways you may provide the information and the types of information you may submit. We also tell you how we may use the information. 

   

Information We Share 

We do not sell or otherwise disclose personal information about our customers, except as described here. We may share the personal information you provide to us with our affiliates worldwide, licensees and joint venture partners for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice. We also may share the information with our service providers who perform services on our behalf based on our instructions. These service providers are not authorized by us to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. 

As described above, if you apply for a Polo Ralph Lauren credit card at one of our Stores, we may provide the information on your application to the credit card issuer to fulfill your request. 

We also may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process (such as a court order), (ii) in response to a request by law enforcement authorities, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity. We also reserve the right to transfer personal information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use personal information you have provided to us in a manner that is consistent with our Privacy Notice. Following such a sale or transfer, you may contact the entity to which we transferred your personal information with any inquiries concerning the processing of that information. 

   

Links to Other Sites 

This website may contain links to other sites for your convenience and information. These sites may be operated by companies not affiliated with Polo Ralph Lauren. Linked sites may have their own privacy policies, which we strongly suggest you review if you visit any linked websites. We are not responsible for the content of any websites that are not affiliated with Polo Ralph Lauren, any use of those sites, or the privacy practices of those sites. 

   

How We Protect Personal Information 

We maintain appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect the personal information you provide on this website or in our Stores against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use and other unlawful forms of processing. We use Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") technology to protect the transmission over the Internet of your payment card data. You can check the security of your connection by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure site, the first characters of the site address change from "http" to "https." If you are using a web browser or firewall that does not permit communications through secure sites, you will not be able to make purchases on our site. 

We strive to protect the confidentiality and security of Social Security numbers ("SSNs") in our possession, custody or control by employing reasonable safeguards seeking to (i) restrict employee access to and use of SSNs; (ii) prevent unauthorized third party access to SSNs, and (iii) prohibit unlawful disclosure of SSNs. 

   

Transfer of Personal Information to Other Countries 

We may transfer the personal information we collect about you to countries other than the country in which you originally provided it. These countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you provided the information. When we transfer your information to other countries, we will protect that information as described in this Privacy Notice. 

Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation is certified under the Safe Harbor privacy framework set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, storage, transfer, use and other processing of personal information transferred from the European Economic Area ("EEA") or Switzerland to the United States.

Access and Correction 

Subject to applicable law, we provide you with access to personal information we have retained about you and the ability to review, correct, update, block or delete the information where it is inaccurate. Subject to applicable law, we may limit or deny access to personal information where providing such access is unreasonably burdensome or expensive under the circumstances. Please submit your request to the address specified in the "How to Contact Us" section below. Please include your name, email address and postal address in your request. 

   

Your Choices 

We offer you certain choices about how we communicate with you and what information we collect from you. You may withdraw any consent you previously provided to us or object at any time on legitimate grounds and free of charge to the processing of your personal information, and we will apply your preferences going forward.
