Privacy We at RugsUSA.com respect the privacy of visitors to our web site. You control what personal information, if any, you share with us. You are not required to tell us who you are or to reveal any information about yourself.

Listed below is the information we do collect and how we use that information:

1\. RugsUSA.com is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to any other company or organization.

2\. As with any web page, our web server collects your domain name, but not your e-mail address. This is standard data collected by all Internet servers. This information is used to measure and evaluate the use of our web site.

3\. We request information from the user on our order form. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer’s orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user. We also ask you to provide your email address so that we may answer your questions quickly and efficiently. We are concerned about your privacy and we want to maintain the highest standards of confidence for our customers.

Security 

We take every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing’. While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers’ information is protected.
