<strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong><br><br>
Rugs USA is committed to respecting the privacy rights of our customers and all visitors to our web site. We take this matter very seriously, and have instituted many policies and procedures to insure that none of your privacy rights as stated herein are ever violated. The following outlines Rugs USA 's privacy policy and details the measures we have	 taken to safeguard and protect your privacy, while providing you with a unique and rewarding online shopping experience. By visiting Rugs USA , you are agreeing to the policies detailed below.
<br><br>
<strong>What if i communicate with Rugs USA  electronically?</strong>
<br><br>
When you send an email to Rugs USA  or visit the web site, you are communicating with us electronically. When you send an email to Rugs USA , you consent to receive communications from us electronically in response. Please note that this does not constitute opting in to our email or direct mail lists. Rugs USA  may communicate with you by email, by updating or posting notices on the web site. You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosure and other communications that Rugs USA  provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communication be in writing. All communications with Rugs USA  become the property of Rugs USA .
<br><br>
<strong>What information does Rugs USA  collect?</strong>
<br><br>
In order to serve you better, Rugs USA  collects and stores your personal information when you: (i) create an account  (ii) sign up to be notified of special deals like discounts and exclusive offers; or (iii) enter a contest or promotion on our site. An account is created when you do one of following things: make a purchase on Rugs USA , create a wish list on Rugs USA , or register for an account on Rugs USA , or enter certain Rugs USA  sweepstakes. When creating an account, we ask you for your first and last name, your e-mail address, a password, and perhaps some other similar information. If you are making a purchase, we will additionally ask you for your billing address, shipping address, and credit card information.
<br><br>
Our system also may gather information about the areas you visit on our site as well as the IP address you use to connect to our site. We may use this data internally only for 2 reasons: 1) to personalize your experience on Rugs USA .com and the marketing materials you receive from Rugs USA  or its partners and 2) to prevent fraud on your account. We would not share any of this data on an individual basis (we may share it in an aggregate form without personal identifiers) with any outside company other than perhaps consultants or service providers of Rugs USA  who were assisting Rugs USA  in serving you better. We do not keep track of where you go on the World Wide Web.
<br><br>
<strong>What does Rugs USA  do with this personal information?</strong><br><br>
Your information is used to process your orders and personalize your shopping experience on Rugs USA , for internal purposes and to comply with any legal requirements. By storing your personal information on a secure server, Rugs USA  is able to shorten your checkout process and allow you to check your order status online.
<br><br>
At Rugs USA , we also review what kinds of products appeal most to our customers as a group. This statistical information helps us improve our offering in the same way that other companies change their catalog based on what sells best. We may also use information about the kinds of products you buy from Rugs USA  to make other marketing offers to you. Of course, you always have the option to opt-out from receiving such offers (for instructions on how to opt-out, please see below).  
<br><br>
<strong>Does Rugs USA  share any information it collects with outside parties?</strong><br><br>
We may use your purchase information about the products you buy from Rugs USA  to make other marketing offers to you. Of course, you always have the option to opt-out from receiving such offers (for instructions on how to opt-out, please see below). We may share this information with consultants or service providers to help Rugs USA  serve you better. Of course, to the extent that we would ever share any of that information with a consultant or service provider, we would only do so if that party agreed to protect your private information by adopting a privacy policy at least as stringent as our own.  
<br><br>
<strong>How does Rugs USA  safeguard my personal information?</strong><br><br>
Rugs USA  has implemented a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information. Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of employees who have special access rights. When you place orders or access your personal information, we offer the use of a secure server.

This page can be accessed by clicking the my account link at the top of every page on the site. Rest assured that all of your information within my account is secure and accessible only by you or limited Rugs USA personnel.
<br><br>
<strong>How does Rugs USA  use my e-mail address?</strong><br><br>

<br><br>
<strong>Does Rugs USA  use "cookies"?</strong><br><br>
A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a web site that is saved on your hard disk by your computer's browser. The cookie holds information a site may need to personalize your experience and to gather web site statistical data, such as which pages are visited, the internet provider's domain name and country that our visitors come and the addresses of the sites visited immediately before coming to and immediately after leaving Rugs USA.com. However, none of this information is associated with you as an individual. It is measured anonymously and only in the aggregate. The information in the cookies lets us trace your "click stream" activity (i.e., the paths taken by visitors to our site as they move from page to page). Cookies do not capture your individual email address or any private information about you.
<br><br>
Rugs USA  may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our web site as well as third party companies to provide tracking and analysis of information and data collected from visitors to our web site.

Rugs USA  reserves the right to change the terms of service, including this privacy policy, at any time, without advanced notice. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
