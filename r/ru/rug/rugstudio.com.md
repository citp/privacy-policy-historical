**** With your permission, we occasionally send you information about new products and services, or offers that we feel may be of interest to you.

We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order.

We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.

You can [register](http://www.rugstudio.com/index.asp?PageAction=LOGIN) with our website, or [login](http://www.rugstudio.com/index.asp?PageAction=LOGIN) to your existing account, if you would like to receive additional information or updates on our new products and services. Information you submit on our website will not be used for this purpose unless you fill out the registration form.

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser the number of individuals visiting a certain area on our website, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

**** To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

All customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access.

**** Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

**** You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by contacting us directly, as described below. We use this procedure to better safeguard your information. You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows error.
