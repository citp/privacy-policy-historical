Rugby World Cup Limited ("RWC") has created this privacy statement to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following is a full description of our information collection and dissemination practices for www.rugbyworldcup.com and the Rugby World Cup App (collectively or individually known as "the site"). It sets out what information is collected about you when you visit the site, how this information is used, if it is disclosed and the way in which we protect users' privacy. Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal information and how we will treat it.

RWC is the organisation responsible for the collection and processing of personal information collected through or in relation to the site, except for information collected through forms on the site which are displayed in the Japanese language – the organisation responsible for the collection and processing of that personal information is the Rugby World Cup 2019 Organising Committee ("Japan Rugby 2019").

In this privacy statement, when we refer to "we", "us" or "our", we are referring to RWC and/or Japan Rugby 2019, depending on which of us has the relevant personal information.

We fully respect your right to privacy, and any personal information which you volunteer to either of us will be treated with the highest standards of security and confidentiality in accordance with the terms of the applicable data protection and privacy laws (RWC is subject to Irish / EU and Japan Rugby 2019 to Japanese law).

#### COLLECTION OF INFORMATION

In general, you can visit the site without providing personal information. However, there may be times when we will request personal information in order that you may participate in the site's activities or features. 

Information is typically requested when you wish to take part in certain activities available on the site, or otherwise to facilitate access to and/or use of certain parts of the site (such as when you contact us, request particular information, or subscribe to our newsletter services, or enter a competition and/or subscribe for or make use of other services (for example, subscription services) available on the site. If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence.

The personal information collected may include, but is not limited to, the following: name, involvement in Rugby, age, country of residence, country supported, nationality, gender and/or your confirmation that you have read and agree with the Terms and Conditions applicable to the site. 

In addition, in order to access some services or parts of the site  or to access and/or take advantage of certain services available on the site (e.g. to receive newsletters or receive information about volunteering and/or tickets), you may be asked to register, or sign in with an e-mail address and to choose a password. In this case your chosen password and other information (including e-mail address) are collected, retained and used to create a unique logon for you to access the services or a particular part of the site.

Any personal information collected is retained only for as long as it is required, given the reason why we hold it.

HOW WE USE INFORMATION

When you submit personal information to us through the site, you agree that your information may be stored and processed by and/or on behalf of RWC and Japan Rugby 2019. RWC and Japan Rugby 2019 may each disclose your information to the other.

RWC may collect information about your interaction with the site and the services on the site. This may include information about your computer and, where available, your IP address operating system and browser type. In particular, RWC reserves the right to perform statistical analysis of user behaviour and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the site and to ascertain the number of users that have visited particular web pages. RWC will provide only aggregated data from these analyses to third parties and this statistical information does not identify any individual. 

We collect and uses your information in order to give you a better service and to provide you with information you request, and (subject to the preferences that you express through the site) other information that may be of interest to you, including information about RWC, Japan Rugby 2019, the Rugby World Cup tournament, its governing structure, schedule, venue introduction, ticket sales and other events and activities, and the Game of Rugby Union. Your information is also used to fulfil your requests for certain information and/or services from us or our associated organisations (e.g. subscription to our newsletters, to participate in polls, and/or to set language preferences), to participate in certain activities (e.g. to facilitate access to and/or use of parts of the site content,) and/or to make the site more useful to you (e.g. where you express interest in volunteering and/or tickets for the Rugby World Cup tournaments and/or events and for us to provide you with relevant information). Your personal information may be used to contact you when necessary.

Once you have given us your personal information, we need to continue to process it, as described in this privacy statement, for the purposes of our legitimate interest in pursuing the purposes described above. We will, however, delete your information from our records if you ask us to do so (see Contacting the Site).

If you prefer not to receive information from‎ us, or from other organisations to which we may disclose your personal information, let us know by exercising the marketing preferences offered when we collect your details or contacting us (see (Contacting the Site)).

If you have subscribed to any services on the site requiring registration (for example, to receive communications from RWC) and you no longer wish to be subscribed to those services: 

(a) depending on the services you have subscribed to, you may have the ability to unsubscribe your personal information online (for example by clicking “unsubscribe” button or link on the site). In order to prevent your personal information from being viewed by others, you will be required to sign and/or log in with your credentials (for example, e-mail address and password);

(b) any request(s) to unsubscribe your personal information shall be in writing via e-mail to the e-mail address website@rugbyworldcup.com (for RWC) and/or [Organising Committee to insert] (for Japan Rugby 2019) with “unsubscribe” in the Subject line. Any requests should include enough information to enable us to satisfy ourselves as to your identity and to determine the services from which you wish to unsubscribe.

By unsubscribing from any services requiring registration on this site, your subscription status will be set to inactive and you will not receive any further communication. If you wish to have your personal information removed, please refer to the procedures outlined below (i.e. under the heading “Your rights to access, correct, modify and/or remove your personal information”).

#### WHO USES INFORMATION

We confirm that, in general, we will only use the personal information you provide within our respective organisations. Where we want to pass your personal information on to someone else, unless you have already and/or previously given us your permission to do so, we will tell you - refer to the notices on particular web pages that let you know why we are requesting the information and to whom it will be made available. The option will then be yours to submit your personal information or not.

The associated organisations to which, with your permission, we will release your personal information are limited to our worldwide partners, tournament sponsors and official suppliers, World Rugby (including its associated companies), and the Member Unions thereof (including the Japan Rugby Football Union), organisations associated with us (subcontractors) and the organising committees of future Rugby World Cup tournaments. 

We may share the information with our service providers who perform services on our behalf based on our instructions –this includes the companies designated by Japan Rugby 2019 as its ticket sales company, companies that issue email magazines and other companies as necessary to administer this site and plan, promote, advertise and implement Rugby World Cup 2019. These service providers are not authorised by us to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. Except as explained in this privacy statement, we will only disclose your personal information without notice when we believe disclosure to be required by law or regulation, or necessary to protect or defend our rights or property, the safety of the public or the users of the site.

#### CHILDREN UNDER 16

If you are under 16, you must obtain the approval of a parent or guardian before you send us any of your personal information (such as your name, e-mail address, home address, date of birth etc.).

#### CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

We reserve the right to change our security and privacy policies at any time. Accordingly, we recommend that you check this page periodically in order to review our current policies.

#### LINKS TO OTHER WORLD RUGBY WEBSITES, OR OTHER THIRD PARTY WEBSITES

The site may contain links to other websites whose privacy and information practices may be different to ours, including other World Rugby websites and/or third party websites. We are not responsible or liable for the content or privacy policies of websites other than this site. You should be aware of this when you leave the site and we encourage you to read and familiarise yourself with the privacy policies and/or notices on other websites you visit. 

#### SECURITY

We are committed to protecting the security of your information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your information from unauthorised access and use. As effective as modern security practices are, no physical or electronic security system is entirely secure. We cannot guarantee the complete security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. We have implemented policies to ensure that your privacy is safeguarded and we will continue to revise policies and implement additional security features as new technologies become available. 

The transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted to the site. Any transmission of information is at your own risk. Once we receive your information, we use appropriate security measures to seek to prevent unauthorised access.

Where we have given you a password which enables you to access certain parts of the site, we urge you to take precautions to protect your personal information when you are on the Internet. Keep any passwords safe and make sure you use a secure browser.

#### USE OF YOUR INFORMATION OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION

Japan Rugby 2019 is in Japan, which (of course) is outside the European Union, and we may both use service providers outside the European Union. Some of the other persons to whom we may provide your information, as described above, may also be outside the European Union. Countries outside the European Union may not provide a level of legal protection for your information as strong as the level of protection provided in Ireland or your home country. Where RWC transfers your personal information collected through the site to a country outside the European Union (including to Japan Rugby 2019) it will put in place a data transfer agreement with the overseas recipient of the information, protecting the information, in the appropriate standard form approved for this purpose by the European Commission (please contact us (see Contacting the Site) if you would like to see a copy of any of these agreements). The only exceptions are where RWC transfers information to member states of the European Economic Area or to countries outside the European Union which have been determined to provide an adequate level of protection by the European Commission, or where the transfer is legally justified on another basis.

#### YOUR RIGHTS TO ACCESS, CORRECT, MODIFY AND/OR REMOVE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

You have the right to receive a copy of and/or access, correct, modify and/or remove the personal information that we hold about you. 

If you wish to receive a copy of the personal information that we hold about you and/or to have the personal information you provided to us removed, or if you no longer wish for your personal information to be processed, stored and/or used, your request shall be in writing and shall be directed to the contact details as set out below. You should include enough information to enable us to satisfy ourselves as to your identity and to determine the nature and scope of your request.

If you wish to access, correct or modify any personal information you have provided to us, you have the right to have such information corrected and/or modified. The appropriate method(s) for accessing, correcting and/or modifying your personal information are set out below:

(a) depending on the sites or service you have used, you may have the ability to access, correct and/or modify your personal information online. In order to prevent your personal information from being viewed by others, you will be required to sign and/or log in with your credentials (for example, e-mail address and password);
