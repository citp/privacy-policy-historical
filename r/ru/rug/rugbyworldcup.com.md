Some of the other persons to whom we may provide your information, as described above, may also be outside the European Union. Countries outside the European Union may not provide a level of legal protection for your information as strong as the level of protection provided in Ireland or your home country. Where RWC transfers your personal information collected through the site to a country outside the European Union (including to Japan Rugby 2019) it will put in place a data transfer agreement with the overseas recipient of the information, protecting the information, in the appropriate standard form approved for this purpose by the European Commission (please contact us (see **_How to contact us_** ) if you would like to see a copy of any of these agreements). The only exceptions are where RWC transfers information to member states of the European Economic Area or to countries outside the European Union which have been determined to provide an adequate level of protection by the European Commission, or where the transfer is legally justified on another basis.

**How long do we keep your information?**

Any personal information collected is retained only for as long as it is required, given the reason why we hold it including for the purposes of satisfying any accounting, reporting or other legal requirements, in accordance with our Data Retention Policy. For example, RWC will delete personal information if it has not communicated with you for a year, or if it has held your information for a year and you have not subscribed to any particular communications or services, or earlier if you ask RWC to delete your personal information.

You have the right to prevent marketing information being sent direct to you. If you prefer not to receive information from‎ us, or from other organisations to which we may disclose your personal information, let us know by exercising the marketing preferences offered when we collect your details or contacting us (see ( ** _How to contact us_** )).

 or, alternatively

you can request to unsubscribe your personal information by e-mail to the e-mail address [website@rugbyworldcup.com](mailto:website@rugbyworldcup.com) with “unsubscribe” in the Subject line. Any requests should include enough information to enable us to satisfy ourselves as to your identity and to determine the services from which you wish to unsubscribe.

**Children under 16**

We understand that extra considerations must be taken when processing the personal data of children under 16, and have taken this into account in drafting this privacy notice, and in concluding that our legitimate interests can be relied on as the legal basis for our processing of children’s registration data in connection with the site. If you are under 16, you must obtain the approval of a parent or guardian before you choose to receive any services or communications from us in connection with the site.

**Security**

The security of the information you provide is very important to us and we try to provide secure transmission of your information.

Once we receive your information, we take technical and organisational security measures that we believe are reasonably appropriate to protect it from loss, misuse, unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration and destruction to ensure the data's integrity. We use a combination of technological, physical, administrative and organisational controls as well as non-disclosure or confidentiality agreements as we deem appropriate to protect your information.

We urge you to take precautions to protect your personal information when you are on the Internet. Keep any passwords safe and make sure you use a secure browser. In addition, you should take reasonable precautions when using a computer that is not your own or in a public setting.
