To really understand any one company’s privacy practices, it helps to understand their business.  There likely are similarities between this policy and the policy on the website for your church, your school, your local coffee shop or your favorite online store but we all perform different services.  

the Rubicon Project offers premium website publishers a technology platform that gives them complete control and visibility over their advertising inventory, and matches every impression with the highest paying demand source. Almost all of the information we collect is from or through the web publishers and advertisers who utilize our service and not directly from consumers.

### Data We Collect

When you visit our Web site you may provide us with personally identifiable information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected on an individual basis. When you visit our customers’ Web sites, you may provide us with non-personally identifiable information collected on an aggregate basis.

#### Personally identifiable Information (“PII”)

Our customers are asked to provide the following:  Name, Company Name, Mailing Address, Email Address, Phone Number, Basic Site Information (URL, Channel, Impression Traffic), Username, Tax I.D. Number and Password.

In addition, if you choose to correspond with us through email or blog postings, we may retain the content of your email messages together with your email address and our responses.

#### Non-Personally identifiable Information (“Non-PII”)

Similar to other commercial Web sites, we collect information about how customers’ Web sites are used and to determine user response to advertisements and promotions.  

Non-PII collected includes the following: IP address, domain, browser type and language, referring Web site addresses, date/time of visits, page view data, and search keywords.  Non-PII is collected using the following standard web technologies:

  * “Cookies” are data files, which often include an anonymous unique identifier, sent to your browser from a web site. Cookies can only be read by the party placing the cookie, they cannot erase or alter any of your data and they do not include personal data.  For more information about cookies visit [http://www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/). 
  * “Log files” track actions occurring on Sites and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, click data and types of advertisements viewed. 
  * "Web beacons" are electronic files used to track your navigation of a website or collection of sites, the completion of transactions, submittal of applications and browsing behavior.



Collectively these technologies enable us to better understand and segment our customers’ audiences on an aggregate basis. Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal information about you and we do not store any personal information that you provided to us in your cookies.

### How We Use The Information

Broadly speaking, while we may collect and use personal information such as email address, name and phone number for purposes of administering and expanding our business activities, providing customer service and making available other products and services to our customers and prospective customers; our core business services rely on non-PII collected to match advertisers and website publishers. This benefits web users by enabling advertisers to deliver ad content that is relevant to interests or to respect a user’s preference to not receive certain advertisements.

Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to our Web site, new services and special opportunities we think you will find valuable. You may notify us at any time if you do not wish to receive these offers by emailing us at [care@rubiconproject.com](mailto:care@rubiconproject.com).

  * to comply with applicable laws and regulations or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, whether or not a response is required by applicable law; 
  * to enforce an agreement or to protect our rights; with any parent, affiliated or successor entity;
  * in connection with any asset sale, transfer, divestiture or liquidation; 
  * in connection with strategic alliances, partnerships or other business arrangements to permit the offering of products or services we think may be of interest to you or where we have determined that the information will be used in a responsible manner by the third party; or
