# Privacy Policy

## Privacy Policy and Terms of Use

Ruby Tuesday, Inc. ("Ruby Tuesday") is very sensitive to the privacy concerns of our visitors. We want to make sure your online experience is safe and enjoyable. Any information collected from you through the website or mobile application displaying this policy (referred to in this policy as our “web sites”) is used to provide you with a broad range of services. Depending on the service you are accessing, you may be asked at times to provide information such as name, e-mail address, and opinion and concerns about certain products and services. Ruby Tuesday uses its web sites as communication tools. We collect information which identifies your mode of communication, such as which browser you use, the state in which your Internet server is located, how long you visit and where on our web site you view. This information is used to update and enhance your visit to Ruby Tuesday web sites. 

Ownership of any information you provide will be held by Ruby Tuesday alone. We do not sell ownership of this data to any other company or organization nor transfer information to competitors. Information about your visit is used internally at Ruby Tuesday.

**Opt-In Email Communications**  
There is an optional section of our web site where input forms require your name, phone number, mailing address, e-mail address, and other personal information. This form provides the ability to opt-in to receiving future emails of any sort from Ruby Tuesday and its affiliates. If you opt-in to receiving email communications from us, then we may send information to you on our products or services and the products and services of our affiliates.

You may review and change your information with us at any time by clicking on the “update profile” link on the site or similar found at the bottom of emails sent via our system, or by contacting us at [GuestServices@rubytuesday.com](mailto:guestservices@rubytuesday.com). 

To opt-out from having any provided information used for email communications from us, please click on the opt-out (unsubscribe) link in any message you receive from us. This will allow you to unsubscribe or update your message preferences. Alternately, you may contact us at [GuestServices@rubytuesday.com](mailto:guestservices@rubytuesday.com).

We never knowingly request personally identifiable information from children. This position is consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998.

**Cookies**  
When you visit our website, we send one or more cookies – a small file containing a string of characters – to your computer or other device that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies to track web analytics information including user trends and search preferences, improve the quality of our services, and for storing and retrieving user preferences. You can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie so you have the chance to accept it and can set your browser to turn off cookies. No personally identifying information from you will be collected as part of these cookies.

**Logs & IP Addresses**  
When you access our site, we automatically record and store information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.

At times we will use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our web site. We also may track browser types to help us understand our visitors' needs related to our web site design.

**Links**  
Sometimes there may be links on our web site that allow you to leave our site. We do not control the links or these web sites and we are not responsible for the contents of any linked site. The inclusion of any link does not imply our endorsement of that web site. The use and/or privacy policy of a linked web site may be different from that of Ruby Tuesday web sites. In any case, we cannot be responsible for the use of your information by linked sites.

**Personal Information**  
Although unlikely, we may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide personally identifiable information to the appropriate governmental authorities. If requested as part of a legal proceeding, we will provide this information upon receipt of the appropriate documentation.

**Third Party Collection of Information**  
We use a third party to serve ads on our behalf across the web sites and the Internet. The third party may also collect anonymous information about your visits to our web site. This is primarily accomplished through the use of a technology device, commonly referred to as a Web Beacon or an Action Tag, which we place on various web pages within our web site that allows the third party to collect anonymous information. The third party may use information about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide ads about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by the third party, [click here](http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy_cookies.html). The third party reports the anonymous data that they collect on our behalf back to us, which we link to our customers' personally identifiable information for the purposes of better serving you. When we merge this data, it is treated under this policy as personally identifiable information as described above.

**Terms of Use**

**Notice and Choice**  
We notify individuals about the personal information we collect from them, how we use it, and how to contact us with privacy concerns. Consent for personal information to be collected, used, and/or disclosed in certain ways may be required in order for an individual to obtain or use our services. We reserve the right to process personal information in the course of providing professional services to our clients without the knowledge of individuals involved.

**Data Security, Integrity, and Access**  
We employ physical, electronic, and managerial measures, including education and training of our personnel, designed to provide the personal information in our possession with reasonable protection from accidental loss or destruction, improper use, alteration, or disclosure.

As a security precaution, we may request that the individual provide identifying information such as name, address, birth date, and/or social security number. In addition, we may limit or deny access to personal information where providing such access would be unreasonably burdensome or expensive in the circumstances. In some circumstances, we may charge a reasonable fee, where warranted, for access to personal information.
