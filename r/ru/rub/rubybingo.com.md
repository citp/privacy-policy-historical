Your Information is collected when You register to open an account with us; or when You submit a written query to us.

2.3 By using any of the Services, You acknowledge that You have read, and agree to, the terms of this Privacy Policy and that, where You provide us with Your Information (including, for the avoidance of doubt, by submitting a query to us through one of the Websites, or where You only partially complete an account registration process), You consent to the use by the Operator (and our partners and subcontractors) of Your Information for the purposes set out in paragraph 3 of this Privacy Policy.
