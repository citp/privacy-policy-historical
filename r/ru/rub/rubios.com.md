Address  
E-mail address

Credit/Debit Card Information - only in encrypted form on secure servers

We need this information to provide you not only with the information that you've requested but also to let you know about additional services which you might want. We may also use this information to customize your experience using our website.

If you order a gift card and want it to be sent directly to the recipient, we will also ask you to submit information about someone other than you. In such situations, we will ask only for the recipient's name, address, telephone number and e-mail address.

 **Surveys and Contests**

In addition, we may automatically gather general statistical information about our website and visitors, such as IP addresses, browsers, pages viewed, number of visitors, gift cards purchased, etc., but in doing so we do not reference you by individual name, e-mail address, home address, or telephone number. We use this data in the aggregate to determine how much our customers use parts of our site so we can improve the customer experience on our site. We may provide this statistical information to third parties, but when we do so we do not provide personally identifying information without your permission.

 **How We Use the Information**

Our goal is to provide you with a site that best meets your needs, wants and interests.
