Non-personally identifiable information may also include user IP addresses, browser types, domain names, purchasing or usage history and trends, and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of the Service. 

## WHERE AND WHEN IS INFORMATION COLLECTED (INCLUDING THROUGH THE USE OF COOKIES AND ACTION TAGS)?

### Cookies and Action Tags.

We collect non-personally identifiable information passively using "cookies" and "action tags."

"Cookies" are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device in order to identify your Web browser and the activities of your computer on the Service and other websites. Cookies are used to personalize your experience on the Service (such as dynamically generating content on webpages specifically designed for you), to assist you in using the Service (such as saving time by not having to reenter your name each time you use the Service), and to allow us to statistically monitor how you are using the Service to help us improve our offerings. We also may use cookies to target certain advertisements to your browser which may be of interest to you or to determine the popularity of certain content.

In addition to cookies that we place on your computer or mobile device, cookies may also be placed on your computer or mobile device by third parties that we use to display or serve advertisements or to collect non-personally identifiable information in order to provide advertising-related services.

You do not have to accept cookies to use the Service.

Most browsers offer instructions on how to do so in the "Help" section of the toolbar. While you are not required to accept our cookies to access the Service, if you reject cookies, certain products, offerings, features, or resources of the Service may not work properly and you may experience some loss of convenience.

Action tags are invisible to you, and any portion of the Service, including advertisements, or email sent on our behalf, may contain action tags.

By using cookies and action tags together, we are able to gain valuable information to improve the Service and measure the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns. 

Finally, you should be aware that advertisers and other third parties may also use their own cookies or action tags when you click on their advertisement or link to their websites or services on or from the Service.

You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.

You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to us from our system.

We promise that promptly after receiving your request, all personally identifiable information stored in databases we actively use and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as and to the extent reasonably practicable.

## HOW WILL I KNOW IF THERE ARE ANY CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY?

We may also make non-significant changes to this Privacy Policy that generally will not significantly affect our use of your personally identifiable information. We encourage you to check this page periodically for any changes. Your continued use of the Service following the posting of non-significant changes to this Privacy Policy will mean you accept those changes.
