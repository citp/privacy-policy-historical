# Runaware - Privacy

  
  
  
  
Runaware enables users worldwide to evaluate different programs on the Internet. Our business concept is based on providing the service to our users free of charge. In exchange, the companies presenting their programs on the site have access to information about the traffic related to their own software. 

The data collected on Runaware's site is forwarded to software companies that use Runaware to present their programs to the public. The data we collect can largely be divided into three categories - membership information, demographic information and detailed information taken from users who expressly request more information about certain software. 

The demographic information comprises the number of visitors that have chosen to test particular software, when this evaluation took place and the length of time the user took to evaluate the software. No personal information or identifying details are issued. 

If, on the other hand, a user requests more information about one or more software products, this information is forwarded to the party that can fulfill this request - usually the producer/ manufacturer or a local retailer. This voluntary information includes your name, country and e-mail. Membership information is primarily used by Runaware to help build the site around the needs of the user. Besides gaining unlimited testing times, those opting for membership also get a vote, which may possibly influence developments. By communicating with our members, we hope to develop the site's design and content. 

All information submission is voluntary. If you have not expressly given your authorization, no information will be released. And, if you so wish, it is also fully possible to change any information you have submitted.
