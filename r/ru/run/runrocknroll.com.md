COMPETITOR GROUP ONLINE PRIVACY AND COOKIE POLICY

Last Updated:  October 2, 2017

We understand privacy online is important to users of our website, any other domain registered to the Competitor Group, Inc., and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies (“Competitor Group” or “we”), and our mobile apps and social networking pages/profiles/feeds that post or display a link to this privacy policy (collectively, our “Sites”).

This privacy policy (“Policy”) governs our privacy practices with respect to how we collect, use, and disclose consumer personal information gathered from our Sites including, but not limited to, competitor.com, velonews.com, triathlete.com, womensrunning.competitor.com and the websites for Competitor Group events (e.g., Rock ‘n’ Roll Marathon Series® and Carlsbad 5000®). For purposes of Directive 95/946 EC and also, beginning May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Competitor Group Inc. will be the “data controller” of the information we collect through the Sites, unless a different Competitor Group affiliate or subsidiary is identified as the operator of a particular Site, in which case that separately-identified affiliate or subsidiary will be the data controller. This Policy does not apply to raceit.com, active.com, or any other websites, applications or services that do not display or link to this Policy or that display or link to a different privacy policy. By using the Sites or otherwise consenting to the data processing terms identified herein, you expressly consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Policy. If you do not agree to this Policy, please do not use our Sites. If we make any material changes to the Policy, those changes will be posted here so that you are always aware of what personal information is collected, how that information is used, and under what circumstances that information may be disclosed.

Children Under the Age of 13

Our Sites are not intended for children under 13 years of age. No one under age 13 may provide any information to or on the Sites. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are under 13, do not use or provide any information on any of the Sites or on or through any of its features/register on the Sites, make any purchases through the Sites, use any of the interactive or public comment features of the Sites or provide any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, email address, or any screen name or user name you may use. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at [PrivacyPolicy@competitorgroup.com](mailto:PrivacyPolicy@competitorgroup.com).

1.              Information Collected by Us

(a)           Information You Provide.  We collect information about you and the computers or devices you use in various ways when you use our Sites. We collect personal information you provide to us or a Registration Partner (as defined below). For instance, if you register for a Competitor Group event, we and/or our applicable Registration Partner will collect your username, password, name, email address, phone number, birth date, gender, emergency contact information, and other information you provide during registration. We also collect your credit card number, billing address, and other payment information if you purchase products or services on our Sites. If you enter into a promotion, contest or sweepstakes (“Sweepstakes”) sponsored by Competitor Group, we will collect information you provide for such Sweepstakes. We also collect information you provide us in newsletter sign-ups, feedback forms, emails, and surveys, including your email address. We may also obtain information from other sources (e.g., from our Registration Partners, Marketing Partners, and Sweepstakes Partners) or from you offline (e.g., at events) and combine that information with information we collect on our Sites.

(b)           Information Automatically Collected.  When you visit our Sites, some information is automatically collected and logged including, for example, your computer’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, device IDs, operating system, access times, browser type and language, domain name, and the website you visited before you visited our Sites. We also collect information about your usage and activity on our Sites as described below; The information we collect automatically is statistical data and does not include personal information, but we may maintain it or associate it with personal information we collect in other ways or receive from third parties:

(i)            Cookies.  We and our service providers may automatically collect information using “cookies”. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive by a website. Among other things, we and our service providers use cookies to store visitors’ preferences, record session information, such as what items users add to their shopping cart, record user-specific information on what pages users access or visit and what advertisements they click or view, alert visitors to new areas that we think might be of interest to them when they return to our Sites, record past activity at a site in order to provide better service when visitors return to our Sites, ensure that visitors are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads, and customize content based on visitors’ browser type or other information that the visitor sends. Please also see section 1(b)(ii), 1(b)(iii), 1(c), and 2(a) below which describes the cookies that are served by third parties on our Sites. We may also use cookies to target advertising to our users’ interests, both on our Sites and on other unaffiliated websites, based on information including, but not limited to browsing behavior, demographic characteristics, location and personal preferences. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Sites. For further information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your computer and how to manage and delete them, visit <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/> and <http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/> and review Section 5 below.

The following table describes the types of cookies used by Competitor Group:

Type of Cookie | Purpose  
---|---  
Session | Stored only temporarily during a browsing session  
Persistent | 

This type of cookie is saved on your computer for a fixed period and is not deleted when the browser is closed.

Persistent cookies are used where we need to know who you are for more than one browsing session. For example, we use this type of cookie to store your preferences, so that they are remembered for the next visit.  
  
Third-party | These are installed by third parties, such as Chartbeat, with the aim of collecting certain information to carry out rel="noopener noreferrer" various research into behavior, demographics etc. (<http://faq.chartbeat.com/hc/en-us/articles/209522288-Does-Chartbeat-use-cookies->)  
  
(ii)          Web Beacons.  We and our service providers may collect information using Web beacons (aka clear gifs). Web beacons are tiny transparent graphic images embedded in our Sites and in our emails that may be used in combination with cookies to record, measure and understand user behavior. We and our service providers use Web beacons to count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness, tailor content and advertising to user interests, and to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon. To learn more about Web beacons, rel="noopener noreferrer" including how to manage their use in combination with cookies, click [here](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/web-beacons/index.html).

(iii)        Google Analytics.  We use Google Analytics to help us analyze how users use the Sites. Google Analytics uses cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Sites, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Sites. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve our Site and services. Google Analytics collects the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Sites, rather than your name or other personally identifying information. We do not combine the information generated through the use of Google Analytics with your personal information. Although Google Analytics places a persistent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. The information generated by such cookies about your user behavior on our website is transferred to and stored on a server operated by Google in the USA.

By activating the IP-anonymization function of Google Analytics, Google will truncate/anonymize the last octet of the IP address for Member States of the European Union as well as for other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases, the entire IP-address will be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and will be abbreviated there. The IP-address submitted by your browser through Google Analytics will not be combined with other data by Google without an explicit and separate consent by you. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Sites is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use rel="noopener noreferrer" and the Google Privacy Policy. You can find out more information about Google Analytics cookies [here](https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies) and you can avoid the use rel="noopener noreferrer" of Google Analytics relating to your use of our Site by downloading and installing the browser plugin available via this [link](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB).

(c)            Social Networks.  If you log in to one of the Sites with your login credentials from a social networking site (“SNS”), such as Facebook or Google+, we may receive personal and anonymous information about you from the SNS. We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via our Sites, and we may use it as described in this Policy. We are not responsible for any errors in the information your SNS provides to us. We may provide information about you to your SNS in accordance with your request (e.g., if you want to post something from our Sites to your Facebook wall), for your SNS’s own use, which will be subject to the SNS’s privacy policy. We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible for any SNS’s use of information we provide to it or for any SNS’s compliance with its own privacy policy.

2.              Third Parties  
Third Party Advertisements and Interest Based Advertising.  
(a)           We may use ad exchanges, ad networks, audience segment providers and other third parties to serve ads and help us deliver ads on the Sites (“Advertising Partners”). These Advertising Partners make certain information available to us and they also automatically collect information about our users’ interactions with our Sites and other sites and mobile applications not affiliated with us. The information they collect and information they may provide to us includes: unique IDs associated with cookies; Internet Protocol address and geographic locations derived from IP addresses; device information including unique device IDs, HTTP headers or other internet transfer protocol signals; browser or device type and version; operating system type and version; information about the presence or use of “apps” on mobile devices, a user’s preferred language; information about a user’s browsing activities and interactions with our Sites and other sites, including advertisements clicked, websites, apps and content areas visited, and the date and time of these activities. The information provided may also include offline information that is de-identified (so that it isn’t associated with a particular person), including demographic information such as a user’s gender, age, zip code, income range and interests. Advertisers on the Sites may collect similar information. Our Advertising Partners and advertisers collect this information using their own cookies, Web beacons, JavaScript and other technologies. We do not control these third parties’ tracking technologies or how they may be used. If you have any questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should contact the responsible provider directly. 

(b)           Subject to applicable law, the information provided and collected by our Advertising Partners is used to create Profiles and Interest Segments that in turn are used to enhance your online experience by delivering marketing campaigns that make the content and ads you see on our Sites, other sites and mobile applications more relevant to you. A “Profile” is a set of attributes about a specific user or device (e.g., a woman, aged 25-34, who lives in Chicago and is interested in travel, shoes and professional football). An “Interest Segment” is a group of Profiles that share a common behavior or preference, like travel. Advertising Partners and advertisers on our Sites that collect similar information, may deliver these targeted marketing campaigns on our Sites and on websites or mobile applications that are unrelated to us. Similarly, Advertising Partners may develop Profiles in connection with multiple devices (such as desktops, smartphones and tablets), browsers and/or mobile applications that you use, and link those Profiles and corresponding interest data using cross-device and cross-app technology. This technology is designed to enable Advertising Partners to connect a user’s Profile and Interest Segments across different devices, browsers and applications that he or she uses to access digital content. For example, a user’s interests determined while viewing a website on a desktop browser might lead to the user seeing a relevant ad while viewing a different website on the user’s smartphone.

(c)           You may learn more about interest-based advertising, how to opt out of such advertising, and how to limit the related collection and use of your information by Advertising Partners by clicking on the links of a number of self-regulatory organizations:

(d)           Registration Partners.  We may provide your personal information to third-party event registration services that manage registration in Competitor Group events, such as raceit.com and active.com, (“Registration Partners”) or authorize them to collect your personal information directly. This Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, the information collection, sharing or security practices of any Registration Partners, and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of our Registration Partners to learn about their privacy practices. Registration Partners may share your information with us in accordance with their respective privacy policies and we may share your information with them as described below.
