ASICS retains your personal data for as long as required to satisfy the purpose for which they were collected and used (for example, for the time necessary for us to send you the newsletters you subscribed to, to provide you with customer service, answer queries or resolve technical problems, etc.), unless a longer period is necessary for our legal obligations or to defend a legal claim.

If you have created an ASICS ID account or another ASICS account with us, we will delete that account and your personal data upon your request or 30 days after it has become inactive. We will consider your account ‘inactive’ when you haven’t used your ASICS ID account or another ASICS account for a period of 2 years. Before your account becomes inactive, we will notify you to use your ASICS ID or another ASICS account to prevent your account from being inactive. When we cancel your account, your personal data will be deleted, such with the exception of your account data and your training and running data in case you are using the RunKeeper app, which data will be stored for an additional 4 years after your account becomes inactive (unless you ask us to delete your data earlier).
