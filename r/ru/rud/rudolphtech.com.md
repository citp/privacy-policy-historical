# Legal & Privacy - Rudolph Technologies

## Privacy Policy

Rudolph Technologies, Inc. (“Rudolph Technologies”) honors the right to privacy of the visitors to its website and we are committed to safeguarding it. This policy explains how Rudolph Technologies handles any personally identifying information submitted to the company online. Personally identifying information is information that enables the company to identify the submitting individual, for example, their e-mail address, name, phone number, etc.

### How Rudolph Technologies Collects and Uses Personally Identifying Information

Any individual is free to visit the Rudolph Technologies website anonymously and is not required to reveal any personally identifying information. The sharing of an individual’s personally identifying information is fully voluntary.

The opportunity to share one’s personally identifying information has been made available on the Rudolph Technologies website to make it easier to request information or materials concerning the company’s products and services and to serve the requestor’s needs. Such personal information may include information:

  * about your computer including your IP address, geographical location, browser type and version, and operating system;
  * about your visits to and use of this website including the referral source, length of visit, page views, and website navigation paths;
  * such as your email address, that you enter when you register with Rudolph Technologies website and request to be contacted; and
  * such as your name and email address, that you enter in order to set up subscriptions to Rudolph Technologies’ emails and/or newsletters.



Rudolph Technologies also collects certain anonymous information that cannot be associated with any individual personally, such as the number of visitors to the company’s website and the number of visitors requesting information. Rudolph Technologies may analyze this data to evaluate trends and statistics and to help the company assess customer needs in order to improve the website and better serve its customers.

Before you disclose to Rudolph Technologies the personal information of another person, you must obtain that person’s consent to both the disclosure and the processing of that personal information in accordance with this policy.

Personal information submitted to Rudolph Technologies through the company’s website will be used for the purposes specified in this policy or on the relevant pages of the website. Rudolph Technologies may use your personal information for the following:

  * administering Rudolph Technologies website and business;
  * personalizing Rudolph Technologies website for you;
  * enabling your use of the services available on Rudolph Technologies website;
  * sending you non-marketing commercial communications;
  * sending you email notifications that you have specifically requested;
  * sending you Rudolph Technologies email newsletter, if you have requested it (you can inform Rudolph Technologies at any time if you no longer require the newsletter); and
  * sending you marketing communications relating to our business.



Please let Rudolph Technologies know if the personal information that the company may hold about you needs to be corrected or updated.

### Disclosure and Retention of Personal Information

As reasonably necessary for the purposes set out in this policy, Rudolph Technologies may disclose your personal information to any of the company’s employees, officers, insurers, professional advisers, agents, suppliers, or subcontractors or to any Rudolph Technologies subsidiary. Further, Rudolph Technologies may disclose your personal information:

  * under certain circumstances, to the company’s business partners in order to meet the needs of the individual submitting the information;
  * to the extent that Rudolph Technologies is required to do so by law;
  * in connection with any ongoing or prospective legal proceedings;
  * in order to establish, exercise, or defend Rudolph Technologies legal rights (including providing information to others for the purposes of fraud prevention and reducing credit risk);
  * to the purchaser (or prospective purchaser) of any business or asset that Rudolph Technologies may sell; and
  * to any person who Rudolph Technologies reasonably believes may apply to a court or other competent authority for disclosure of that personal information where, in the company’s reasonable opinion, such court or authority would be reasonably likely to order disclosure of that personal information.



Other than as set forth above, Rudolph Technologies will not, without your express consent, supply your personal information to any third party whether for their or any other third party’s direct marketing or otherwise.

Information that Rudolph Technologies collects may be stored, processed in, and transferred between any of the countries in which the company operates (United States of America, Japan, China, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, European Union) in order to enable Rudolph Technologies to use the information in accordance with this policy. Note that such countries do not currently have data protection laws equivalent to those in force in the European Economic Area.

Personal information that you publish on the Rudolph Technologies website or submit for publication on the website may be available, via the internet, around the world. Rudolph Technologies cannot prevent the use or misuse of such information by others.

You expressly agree to the transfers of personal information described above.

Personal information that Rudolph Technologies processes for any purpose or purposes shall not be kept for longer than is necessary for that purpose or those purposes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Rudolph Technologies will retain documents (including electronic documents) containing personal data:

  * to the extent required by law;
  * if the company believes that the documents may be relevant to any ongoing or prospective legal proceedings; and
  * in order to establish, exercise, or defend the company’s legal rights (including providing information to others for the purposes of fraud prevention and reducing credit risk).



### Security of Personal Information

Rudolph Technologies will take reasonable technical and organizational precautions to prevent the loss, misuse, or alteration of your personal information. This includes the storage of all the personal information provided to the company on our secure (password- and firewall-protected) servers. Nevertheless, you hereby acknowledge that the transmission of information over the internet is inherently insecure, and Rudolph Technologies cannot guarantee the security of data sent over the internet.

### Accuracy and Access

Rudolph Technologies desires to maintain the accuracy of any personally identifying information an individual has provided to the company. If an individual has submitted personally identifying information to the company and it has changed, they may contact Rudolph Technologies at [info@rudolphtech.com](mailto:info@rudolphtech.com) to request a change to their personally identifying information.

Rudolph Technologies may withhold personal information that you request to the extent permitted by law.

You may instruct Rudolph Technologies at any time not to process your personal information for marketing purposes.

In practice, you will usually either expressly agree in advance to Rudolph Technologies’ use of your personal information for marketing purposes, or the company will provide you with an opportunity to opt out of the use of your personal information for marketing purposes.
