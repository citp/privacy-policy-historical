PRIVACY POLICY

Effective as of February, 2015

RUUM understands the importance of protecting your privacy and security. We may change or add to this Privacy Policy at any time without notice, so we encourage you to review it periodically. The following statement outlines our practices for collecting, using, disclosing and managing the personal information we collect from our customers and visitors to our website, [www.ruum.com](https://web.archive.org/), including our mobile website (collectively, our "Website"). By purchasing our products or using our services or our Website, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?

Consumer Information

We receive and may keep personal information voluntarily given to us when you make a purchase, register on our Website, take part in a special promotion, or provide any other information or unique preferences to better serve you. Personal information is information you provide that lets us know specific facts about you so that we can fulfill your order(s) and/or customize information we deliver to you. This information may include, but is not limited to:   


  * Your name, address and phone number
  * Date of birth
  * Your e-mail address
  * Credit card or other payment information
  * Any other information that RUUM may voluntarily collect from you from time to time on our Website or through alternate means.



Your personal information is used to provide the products and services that you have ordered or requested, to process and ship orders, to send order and shipping confirmations and to provide customer service. Some of this information also may be used to contact you about sales and special offers, unless you have opted not to receive promotional communications from RUUM.

The personal information we collect may also include information you provide to us about other people. For example, you may provide us with personal information (i.e., name and address) of a merchandise gift recipient. When you provide us with personal information about the intended recipient of a shipment, we use that information solely for the purposes of processing the shipment and, in some cases, to communicate with the intended recipient to provide information pertaining to the status of the shipment. We rely on you to obtain the intended recipient's consent to our use of their personal information for these limited purposes.

## Information from Other Sources

We may receive information about you from other sources such as updated address information and shopping habits. This information may help us to improve our ability to serve your needs such as ensuring the accurate delivery of direct mail materials and providing product recommendations and special offers that we think will interest you.

## Use of Cookies and Other Technology

We collect and store certain other information automatically whenever you interact with our Website. We want you to be aware that certain online tools exist to help us serve and recognize you when you visit our Website. For example, we collect your IP address, browser information and reference site domain name every time you visit our Website. We also collect information regarding customer traffic patterns and site usage. This information is used to analyze and improve our Website and to personalize your experience or better serve your needs.

You may be familiar with the term "cookies", which are files stored on your computer's hard drive by your browser. These cookies may be placed on your computer when you click on a RUUM e-mail, banner, or on our Website directly. We use this information to understand how users navigate to and around our Website, view product pages, access content and make purchases.

Cookies also allow us to hold selections in a shopping cart when a user leaves our Website without checking out. Most browsers accept cookies automatically but allow you to disable them. We recommend that you leave cookies "turned on" so that we can offer you a better shopping experience on our Website.

Our Policy on gathering information from and communicating with children online

We recognize the unique privacy concerns regarding children. Pursuant to COPPA guidelines, we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian is made aware that a child under the age of 13 has provided us with personally identifiable information without their consent, please contact us at 855.RUUM.KIDS / 855.788.6543, by e-mail at [cs@RUUM.com](mailto:cs@RUUM.com), or at the address listed above, and we will remove the information about the individual from our marketing database.

## Our Commitment to Data Security

RUUM makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that personal information collected from you is protected against loss and unauthorized access. This protection applies in relation to information stored in both electronic and hard copy form. RUUM uses industry standard security techniques on our Website to help protect against the loss, misuse or modification of information that you have provided. When you access your personal information or transmit personally identifiable data to us, that information is stored on servers that we have used commercially reasonable efforts to protect from unauthorized access or intrusion. While we implement the above security measures, you should be aware that 100% security is not possible.

## YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS

This supplements the [US Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/privacy-notice---1202).

If applicable, this information would include the categories of customer information and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we shared customer information for the immediately prior calendar year (e.g., requests made in 2005 will receive information regarding 2004 sharing activities).

To obtain this information, please write to us at the address below with "Request for California Privacy Information". Please note that not all information sharing is covered by the "Shine the Light" requirements and only information on covered sharing will be included in our response.
