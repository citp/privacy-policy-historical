##  **COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES**

On the Service, we utilize online identification technologies–such as cookies, web beacons, or pixels–in accordance with applicable law and requirements. Cookies are small text files placed on your hard drive when you visit a website; they store information which is sent back to our servers or those of third parties. As described in more detail below, we use such technologies to:

  * Recognize new or past visitors to the Service;
  * Store your password if you are registered on the Service;
  * Improve the Service and better understand your visits;
  * Integrate with third-party social media websites;

Some cookies are required for certain uses of the Service.

Browser settings may enable visitors either to receive our cookies or use the Service without cookie functionality. Please note that if you restrict the use of cookies, some functions of the Service may be unavailable. We may link the information collection by cookies with other personal data we collect from you pursuant to this Privacy Policy.

##  **SOCIAL FEATURES, ADVERTISING AND ANALYTICS**

Certain functionalities on the Service permit interactions that you initiate between the Service and third-party services, such as social networks (“Social Features”). Social Features enable you to send content between the Service and a third-party service. If you use Social Features, and potentially other third-party services, information you post or provide access to may be publicly displayed by the third-party service you use. Also, both Ronin Gallery and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of the Service and the third-party service.

We may use Google Analytics or other third-party service providers for analytics services. These analytics services may use cookies and other tracking technologies to analyze Service users and how they use the Service. Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic. Google uses the data collected to track and monitor the use of our Service. This data is shared with other Google services. Google may use the collected data to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network.

We may use remarketing services, such as Google AdWords and Facebook, to advertise on third-party websites after you visit our Service. We and our third-party vendors use cookies to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to our Service. These ads may be tailored to your interest based on your use of the Service and elsewhere on the internet, sometimes referred to as “interest-based advertising” and “online behavioral advertising,” which may include sending you an ad on a third-party service after you have left the Service (i.e., “retargeting”). Additionally, we may use your personal data to identify other individuals with similar interests and serve these individuals advertisements using services such as Facebook Lookalike Audiences.

##  **DATA SECURITY**

We maintain appropriate technical and organizational safeguards designed to help protect personal data from unauthorized disclosure or access and accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, or alteration. The security of your data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Although we use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal data obtained through the Service.

##  **RETENTION OF DATA**

We will retain your personal data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use your personal data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies. To determine the appropriate retention period, we will consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the data; the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the data; the purposes for which we process the data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means; and other applicable legal requirements.

##  **TRANSFER OF DATA**

If you are visiting the Services from outside of the United States, please be aware that the Ronin Gallery is based in the U.S. and the personal data that we obtain through the Services will be transferred to, processed and stored on our servers in the United States where the data protection laws may differ from those in your jurisdiction.
