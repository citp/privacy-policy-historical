# Privacy Policy | myLifetime.com

_Updated on February 3, 2009_

 ** _Our Commitment to Privacy_**

Lifetime Entertainment Services, and its subsidiaries and affiliated entities (collectively, "Lifetime", "we", or "us"), realize the importance of feeling safe online and are committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. This Lifetime Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) discloses what information we gather on the network of Web sites that we own and/or operate (collectively, the "Lifetime Sites" or our "Sites"), as well as ways in which we process and, sometimes, share such information and how you can correct or change such information. The Lifetime Sites include [www.mylifetime.com](http://www.mylifetime.com/), [www.lmn.tv](http://www.lmn.tv/), [www.mothersclick.com](http://www.mothersclick.com/), [www.dressupchallenge.com](http://www.dressupchallenge.com/), [www.momblognetwork.com](http://www.momblognetwork.com/), and [www.roiworld.com](http://www.roiworld.com/). Except where otherwise expressly indicated herein or on a Lifetime Site, this Privacy Policy applies only to information collected on the Lifetime Sites and does not apply to information collected outside of the Lifetime Sites. 

Before submitting information to any Lifetime Site, please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. By visiting the Lifetime Sites, submitting information or using any of our products or services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and consent to having your data transferred to and processed in the United States. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Lifetime Sites. 

Certain areas of the Lifetime Sites contain information intended only for registered members (each, a “Member”). Accordingly, Lifetime reserves the right to limit certain areas of the Lifetime Sites to those persons who register for access to certain restricted areas of the Lifetime Sites (“Member Areas”). This Privacy Policy addresses our privacy practices relating to general use of our Lifetime Sites as well as its use by any Member or visitor to the Lifetime Sites (each a “User”). 

**_The Information We Collect_**

We collect the following types of information from our Users: 

**Personally Identifiable Information**

We may receive and store any information you enter on any Lifetime Site or provide to us in any other way that would allow us to identify you or contact you (collectively "Personally Identifiable Information"). The Personally Identifiable Information you provide will only be used by Lifetime in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Examples of Personally Identifiable Information we may collect from you and use: 

  * your name, address, phone number(s), e-mail address, age, nationality and gender if you register as a Member or are otherwise asked to provide such information; 
  * the e-mail addresses of those who post comments, stories, photos, videos and other content on the Lifetime Sites; 
  * the names and e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us by e-mail; 
  * the names and e-mail addresses of those who specifically opt-in to special offers; 
  * information you provide to us in surveys, in connection with contests or sweepstakes which Lifetime sponsors, and/or in response to solicitations for photographs, ideas, or stories for use on a Lifetime Site and/or on air; 
  * information you provide to us in the entry form for some sweepstakes and contests offered on the Lifetime Sites and information provided by winners of those sweepstakes and contests for a required background check or for tax purposes.; 
  * information about your family or friends, including, but not limited to, the name, address, phone number(s), e-mail address, age, nationality and gender of any family member or friend, that you provide in connection with your use of any Lifetime Site or any feature thereof; 
  * information you provide about yourself, including, but not limited to your name, e-mail address, age, nationality, gender, preferences, that you provide when you update your Member profile; and 
  * information you provide about yourself when you post to any Lifetime Site. 



You can choose not to provide us with certain Personally Identifiable Information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of special features of the Lifetime Sites, such as posting comments, creating a Member profile, Member Areas, participating in our online community, entering a Lifetime sweepstakes or contest, participating in various promotional opportunities or receiving e-mail alerts or newsletters. 

**Automatic Information**

We may receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us through the Lifetime Sites. Lifetime automatically receives and records your browser information, operating system information, IP address, cookie information and the page you requested. This information will not be stored in a manner that is personally identifiable with you. 

_Aggregate Information_

In connection with your visit to the Lifetime Sites, we may automatically collect usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of Users to the Lifetime Sites and their components and information about similar groups of users, such as parents, certain age groups or users that live in a particular area. This data is only used in the aggregate, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. Aggregate information generally is collected through the use of cookies and Web Beacons as discussed below. 

_Cookies_

We use “cookies” to help you access and navigate the Lifetime Sites more efficiently and to statistically monitor how many people are using the Lifetime Sites. A “cookie” is a small file or tool stored on the User’s hard drive containing information that allows us to deliver customized information to you. If you register as a Member, we may use cookies to store your e-mail address, user name, preferences and password so we can identify you when you return to the Lifetime Sites, track your use of the Lifetime Sites and customize the Lifetime Sites for you. You may set your browser to notify you of or decline the receipt of cookies; however, certain features of the Sites may not function properly or be available if your browser is configured to disable cookies. 

Lifetime uses both "session" and "persistent" cookies on the Lifetime Sites. Session cookies are temporary bits of information that are erased once you exit your Web browser or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies are more permanent bits of information that are placed on the hard drive of your computer and stay there unless you delete the cookie. They store information on your computer for a number of reasons, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided (i.e., username and password), helping to determine what areas of the Lifetime Sites you find most valuable, and customizing the Lifetime Sites based on your preferences on an ongoing basis. 

Many companies offer programs that help you to visit Web sites anonymously. While Lifetime will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available. 

_Web Beacons_

During your use of the Lifetime Sites, you may encounter Web Beacons, which may come from Lifetime or from third parties that advertise on the Lifetime Sites or provide content. A “Web Beacon”, which is sometimes also called a Web bug or "clear gif," is a small graphic image in a Web page, a Web-based document or an e-mail message, which generally allows the party that set the Web Beacon to monitor certain information about the viewer of the Web page, Web-based document or e-mail message, and may allow access to certain cookies. Web Beacons are usually invisible to the user, because they are very small (generally 1-by-1 pixel). However, in general, any electronic image viewed as part of a Web page, including an advertisement, can act as a Web Beacon. Web Beacons on the Lifetime Sites typically collect the URL of the page the Web Beacon comes from, the type of browser requesting the Web Beacon, the IP address of the computer that the Web Beacon is sent to and the time the Web Beacon was viewed. Certain Web Beacons used by third party advertisers or content providers may collect information that allows such third parties to determine how many people are viewing and/or clicking on certain advertisements or viewing certain content for purposes of helping these parties serve and manage their advertisements and content. These Web Beacons do not collect or store Personally Identifiable Information; however, they may be used in conjunction with cookies to identify certain aggregate information. 

_Information Collected by Third Parties_

We may allow third parties to display advertisements on the Lifetime Sites. Lifetime and these companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies and Web Beacons, to collect information about Users who view or interact with these advertisements and connect to the Lifetime Sites. We do not provide any Personally Identifiable information to these third parties unless you have provided consent. Some of these third party advertising companies may be part of advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt-out of advertisements targeting from member companies - See [http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp)

_Ad Servers_

We may serve up advertisements on the Lifetime Sites through an ad server. As a result of your visit to the Lifetime Sites, the ad server company may collect information such as your IP address, and click stream information. We cannot control the activities of such advertisers or Web sites. For further information, please consult the privacy policy of [Doubleclick](http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/). We do not share Personally Identifiable Information with DoubleClick. 

_E-mail Communications_

When you send an e-mail to Lifetime, either through the ["Contact Us"](http://www.mylifetime.com/about-us/get-help) area of a Lifetime Site or otherwise, Lifetime may retain your e-mail address and the contents of the e-mail you send. This Privacy Policy does not apply to content, business information, ideas, concepts or inventions that you send to Lifetime by e-mail. Please refer to our [Terms of Use](http://www.mylifetime.com/about-us/terms-use) for our policy with respect to such information. If you want to keep any of this content private or proprietary, please do not send such information in an e-mail or otherwise post such information to Lifetime. We may also receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail from Lifetime if your computer supports this type of program, in order to help us make e-mails more interesting and helpful. 

**_How We Use Information_**

When you provide us with your Personally Identifiable Information, we may use such information to manage our Member registry, facilitate communication between Lifetime and you and/or between Members of the Lifetime Sites, notify you of features or special events and provide you with other information we feel may be of interest to you. We also use information we collect to customize, analyze, adjust and improve the Lifetime Sites to meet our Users' needs and expectations. We may use the information to oversee adherence to our Community guidelines, to enforce our agreements with you, to prevent fraud and other prohibited or illegal activities and for other legally permissible purposes. These uses of your Personally Identifiable Information may include, without limitation, the following: 

**Public Areas**

The Lifetime Sites feature groups, discussions, member profiles, comment areas, blogs and similar areas where Users can share information about themselves and their opinions, as well as post questions (“Public Areas”). Other visitors to the Lifetime Sites may view information posted in Public Areas. Further, we may include all or a portion of the information posted in Public Areas in the newsletters described herein. By using the Public Areas, you hereby acknowledge and agree that any information you share in a Public Area (including, without limitation, Personally Identifiable Information) is available to the public. Information you post to a Public Area may be viewed, accessed, or collected by, or disclosed to, third parties and may be used by others in ways neither you nor Lifetime are able to control or predict, including, without limitation, to contact you for unauthorized purposes. 

The Lifetime Sites offer the ability to forward content to another person via e-mail. If you use this service, we will use the recipient's e-mail address in order to send the content and we will also ask for your e-mail address or, for Members, use the e-mail address associated with your profile. We do not use the recipient's e-mail address for any other purpose unless such recipient gives us permission to do so. 

**Member Areas**

If you have access to the Member Areas of the Lifetime Sites as a Member, such Member Areas may contain groups, discussions, member profiles, comment areas, blogs and similar areas where Members can share information about themselves and their opinions, as well as post questions. Information you post to a Member Area may be viewed, accessed, or collected by, or disclosed to, other Members and may be used by other Members in ways neither you nor Lifetime are able to control or predict, including, without limitation, to contact you for unauthorized purposes. As a Member of the Lifetime Sites with access to the Member Areas, we use the Personally Identifiable Information you provide in your profile when registering to become a Member to send you Lifetime publications, information about Member benefits and special offers, features included in the Member Areas and other information that Lifetime believes is relevant and useful to its Members. Lifetime does not sell mailing lists (names and mailing addresses) and e-mail addresses of Members to third parties. By using the Member Areas, you hereby acknowledge and agree that any information you share in a Member Area (including, without limitation, Personally Identifiable Information) is available to other Members and to Lifetime for use as provided herein. 

**Profiles**

If you register to become a Member of any Lifetime Site, the information you provide to Lifetime may be stored in one or more profiles. These profiles, or a portion thereof, may be viewed by other visitors, including, but not limited to those who are not Members, of that Lifetime Site. 

**E-Newsletters**

If you register at any of the Lifetime Sites, you may choose to receive a newsletter via e-mail from Lifetime which may include information such as highlights from different areas on any of the Lifetime Sites and information about new features. You can unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of any e-mail newsletter sent to you and following the instructions. You may also unsubscribe at any time by logging in to the applicable Lifetime Site where you created your profile and changing your preferences. 

**Aggregate Information**

The aggregate information collected by Lifetime is also used to create portraits of the audience for the Lifetime Sites, portraits which present anonymous statistical demographic information but no Personally Identifiable Information. This aggregated information is used, among other things, to determine trends and needs, and also to supply market research to potential advertisers and partners to help them understand who the audience for the Lifetime Sites is. For example, we may create a report that tells advertisers that sixty percent of our Members are females in a certain age range, so that they can determine which of their products or services are most appropriate for our Members. 

**_With Whom We Share Information_**

Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we will not give, share, sell, or trade your Personally Identifiable Information to or with any third parties in any way other than under the following circumstances: 

**Fulfillment of Services**

We may retain other companies and individuals to perform functions consistent with our Privacy Policy on our behalf. Examples include customer support specialists, Web hosting companies, fulfillment companies (e.g., companies that fill product orders or coordinate mailings), data analysis firms and e-mail service providers. Such third parties may be provided with access to Personally Identifiable Information needed to perform their functions, but may not use such information for any other purpose. 

**Disclosure to Advertisers and Promotional Partners**

If you opt in to receive information about identified advertisers or their services or products, we share your Personally Identifiable Information with them. If you have questions about how these companies use your Personally Identifiable Information, we encourage you to review and understand their respective privacy policies. 

**Sweepstakes, Contests and Editorial Uses**

Often times, sweepstakes and contests offered on the Lifetime Sites are sponsored by unaffiliated third parties. Information that you provide as part of an entry into a sponsored sweepstakes or contest will be shared with the sponsor if we advise you of such in the sweepstakes rules. Some sweepstakes and contests will also ask you to consent to the release of information contained within the entry form for background check purposes or tax purposes if you become a winner. You should carefully review the rules of each sweepstakes, contest and giveaway which you enter as they may contain additional important information about Lifetime’s or a sponsor's use of your Personally Identifiable Information. 

Lifetime may also use Personally Identifiable Information you provide to us in response to a solicitation for editorial, online and/or on-air purposes and we may also use such information for marketing and promotional purposes in connection with such solicitation. In the event such information is used online, on a mobile application, or in a telecast, no Personally Identifiable Information, other than name, city and state, will be disclosed without your specific consent. We may share the information with producers of our programs and/or with others involved if you have explicitly advised us of your consent to be included in such an exchange. 

**Compliance with Law and Fraud Protection**

We may disclose any information, including, without limitation, Personally Identifiable Information, we deem necessary, in our sole discretion and without your prior permission, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request. We may also exchange information, including, without limitation, Personally Identifiable Information, with other companies and organizations for credit fraud protection, risk reduction and related activities or to protect the rights, property of safety of Lifetime, its agents, employees or affiliates or others. Lifetime reserves the right to disclose Personally Identifiable Information for a User who we believe is in violation of our Terms of Use, even without a subpoena, warrant, or other court order. 

**Sale or Transfer of Information**

In the event of a sale, merger, liquidation, dissolution, or sale or transfer of substantially all of the assets of Lifetime or any Lifetime Site, personal Information and/or other information collected about you from the Lifetime Sites may be sold, assigned, or transferred to the party acquiring all or substantially all of the equity and/or assets of Lifetime or the Lifetime Site in order to permit the party to continue the operation of the applicable Lifetime Site, including the Member Areas. Subject to your ability to opt-out, by using the applicable Lifetime Site and submitting your information to us, you consent to the sale and transfer of your information as described in this paragraph. 

Except as described above, we will not disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to other third parties unless you have provided consent. 

**_Important Disclosures, Practices and Contact Information_**

**Third Party Links**

The Lifetime Sites contain links to third-party Web sites. Please be aware that we cannot control and are not responsible for the information collection practices of such Web sites, which may differ from those of Lifetime. We encourage you to review and understand the privacy policies of these Web sites before providing any information to them. 

**Interactive Features**

The Lifetime Sites may make groups, discussions, chat rooms, forums and message boards available to Users. While you are required to register with the Lifetime Sites to post in these areas, you are not required to provide any Personally Identifiable Information when using these areas but you may choose to do so. If you post Personally Identifiable Information online, it will be publicly available and you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties. Lifetime cannot ensure the security of any information you choose to make public in a group, discussion, chat room, forum, or message board. Also, we cannot ensure that parties who have access to such Personally Identifiable Information will respect your privacy. Please exercise caution when deciding to disclose Personally Identifiable Information in these areas. 

**Data Security**

We maintain a variety of commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards designed to protect your Personally Identifiable Information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, we use accepted tools and techniques to protect against unauthorized access to our systems. You should be aware that Lifetime has no control over the security of other sites on the Internet you might visit or interact with even when a link may appear to said site from ours. 

We want you to feel confident using the Lifetime Sites. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. In the event of a breach of the confidentiality or security of your personal information, we will notify you as necessary and if possible so you can take appropriate protective steps. We may notify you under such circumstances using the e-mail address(es) we have on record for you, and if you did not provide an e-mail address, by regular mail. Users and Members should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission’s Web site at <http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm> for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft. 

**Children**

Each Lifetime Site is a general audience site, and is not intended for children under 13. Further, we do not knowingly market to, solicit information, accept service or collect information from children under the age of 13. If a child under 13 submits information about themselves to us through any part of the Lifetime Sites, and we become aware that the person submitting the information is a child, we will attempt to delete this information as soon as possible. We require that only persons 13 years of age or older use any Lifetime Site. By using the Lifetime Sites, you hereby represent that you are at least 13 years old. 

**Accessing, Updating or Deleting Your Personally Identifiable Information**

Lifetime respects the privacy of your Personally Identifiable Information. If you tell us that you do not wish to have this information used as a basis for further contact with you, we will respect your wishes. You can also choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of the Lifetime Sites. 

If you are a Member and would like to review, update or delete your profile, please log in to your account and select the profile you would like to review, modify or delete your profile information (i.e., the Personally Identifiable Information you have provided to us). However, we are not in a position at this time to provide you with a copy of information you have provided in response to a market survey, or copies of communications you have sent to our site (e.g., inquiries). 

You may instruct Lifetime to stop sending you certain promotional materials (e.g., e-mail messages, newsletters, postcards and letters) by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in those materials. However, we may continue to contact you to provide service to your account. Please note, however, that if you use more than one name or e-mail address when communicating with us or participating on the Lifetime Sites, you may continue to receive communications from us to any name and/or e-mail address which you have not specified in your request. 

If you wish to opt-out of any continued communication (direct mail, telephone, fax or e-mail communications), please send us an email at privacy@lifetimetv.com. We will process an opt-out request as soon as reasonably practicable. If you choose to opt-out of further communications, we will keep your e-mail address, phone number, name and physical address on file for the purpose of honoring your opt-out request. 

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**

We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices. When we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the updated date at the top of this Privacy Policy. If we make any material changes to our Privacy Policy, we will notify Members by sending an e-mail to the e-mail address(s) provided to us in a Member’s account, profile or registration, and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on the Site. We will give you an opportunity to opt-out of any materially changed Privacy Policy. We recommend that you check the Lifetime Sites from time to time to inform yourself of any changes in this Privacy Policy or any of our other policies. 

**Contacting Us**

If you have any questions about Lifetime generally, this Privacy Policy or any Lifetime Site, please feel free to contact us at: at Viewer Relations, either by e-mail at viewerrelations@lifetimetv.com or by telephone, (212) 424-7122. 

**California Privacy Rights Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83**

If you are a resident of California (“California Users”), in addition to the rights set forth in this Privacy Policy, you generally have the right to request information from us regarding the manner in which we share certain categories of Personally Identifiable Information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. However, under the law, a business is not required to provide this information if it adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing customer’s personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying California Users of their rights to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right. As stated above, we do not share such Personally Identifiable Information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you have requested us to do so, or have otherwise consented, and then subject to your right to opt-out of sharing your personal information for third party marketing purposes. 

Please note that whenever you opt in to receive future communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the third party's privacy policy. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use information. You should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information. California Users may request further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing privacy@lifetimetv.com. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this e-mail address. 

**Users From Outside the United States**

The Lifetime Sites are hosted in the United States. The Lifetime Sites are governed by United States law. If you are visiting any Lifetime Site from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where our servers are located and our central database is operated. The data protection and other laws of the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. By using any Lifetime Site, you consent to your information being transferred to our facilities and to the facilities of those third parties with whom we share it as described in this Privacy Policy. 

**No Rights of Third Parties**

This Privacy Policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties.
