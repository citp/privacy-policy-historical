**Cookies**

First, we use cookies to track when banners from our advertisers are uploaded on a web page to be viewed by a user. We also use cookies as a tracking mechanism for our reporting system to approximate the overall reach of ROIRocket’s ad campaigns, as well as rate of recurrence of the display of the advertisements. This allows ROIRocket to determine how often the advertisement is displayed as well as the total reach of the advertising on the Affiliate’s website.

While both of these activities depend on the use of a “cookie,” visitors to this site always have the option of disabling cookies in their web browser. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. Please see your browser supplier’s website for details on how to do this. ROIRocket works closely with Advertisers (“Advertisers”) that offer advertisements for Affiliates to place on their web sites. Advertisers will have their own policies in place with regards to cookies and ROIRocket has no control over what individual Advertisers do with the information that is collected on Affiliates.

**Information Gathering**
