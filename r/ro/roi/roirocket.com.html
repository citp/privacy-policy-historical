    				<p>First, we use cookies to track when banners from our advertisers are uploaded on a web page to be viewed by a user. We also use cookies as a tracking mechanism for our reporting system to approximate the overall reach of ROI Rocket's ad campaigns, as well as rate of recurrence of the display of the advertisements. This allows ROI Rocket to determine how often the advertisement is displayed as well as the total reach of the advertising on the Affiliate's website.</p>
    				<p>While both of these activities depend on the use of a "cookie," visitors to this site always have the option of disabling cookies in their web browser. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. Please see your browser supplier's website for details on how to do this. ROI Rocket works closely with Advertisers ("Advertisers") that offer advertisements for Affiliates to place on their web sites. Advertisers will have their own policies in place with regards to cookies and ROI Rocket has no control over what individual Advertisers do with the information that is collected on Affiliates.</p> 
    				<h3>Information Gathering</h3>
    				<p>ROI Rocket collects personal contact information by various methods, specific to information necessary for registration of Affiliates to join the ROI Rocket network. The information collected may be used to send the Affiliate company information about ROI Rocket or to send newsletters or updates concerning their ROI Rocket account. All personally identifiable information that is transmitted to ROI Rocket from prospective and approved Affiliates is intended for administrative purposes only, such as tracking sales and commissions to be paid to Affiliates of the ROI Rocket network.</p>
    				<h3>Information Dissemination</h3>
    				<p>We may use the personal information that you supply to us and we may work with other third party businesses to bring selected opportunities to our members via email. These businesses may include providers of direct marketing services and applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation and email marketing.</p>
    				<h3>Children Under 13</h3>
    				<p>ROI Rocket does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally Identifiable Information from or about children under 13 except as permitted by law. If we discover we have received any information from a child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately.
