# Privacy Policy - User Role Editor

This privacy policy describes how role-editor.com uses and protects any information that you give us. We are committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. If you provide us with personal information through role-editor.com you can be assured that it will only be used in accordance with this privacy statement.

## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, role-editor.com collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. role-editor.com’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how role-editor.com’s visitors use it.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to role-editor.com choose to interact with role-editor.com in ways that require role-editor.com to gather personally-identifying information. For example, we ask visitors who buy membership to provide a username and email address.

In each case, role-editor.com collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with role-editor.com. role-editor.com does not disclose personally-identifying information. Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities, like purchasing a User Role Editor Pro membership.

role-editor.com does collect or/and store any financial information. role-editor.com uses [PayPal](https://paypal.com/) as a payment gateway. Any personal information you provide for the payment is processed/stored by PayPal on its own resources.

All of the information that is collected on role-editor.com will be handled in accordance with GDPR legislation.

role-editor.com also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. role-editor.com does not use IP addresses to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information to other parties.

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

role-editor.com discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of project administrators, employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on role-editor.com’s behalf or to provide services available through role-editor.com, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using role-editor.com, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.

role-editor.com will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to project administrators, employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, role-editor.com discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, if you give permission to have your information shared, or when role-editor.com believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of role-editor.com, third parties, or the public at large.

If you are a registered user of a role-editor.com website and have supplied your email address, role-editor.com may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with role-editor.com and User Role Editor Pro. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum.

If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. role-editor.com takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
