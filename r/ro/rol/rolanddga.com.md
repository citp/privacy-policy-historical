# Roland DGA Corporation - Privacy Statement

  
Roland DGA Corporation recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of all information provided by users of www.rolanddga.com. We created the following policy guidelines with a fundamental respect for our users´ right to privacy and because we value our relationships with our users. 

  
Roland DGA Corporation collects information about users during their registration for certain sections of our Website. When users request pages from our Web server, the server automatically attempts to identify the user’s domain name, but not the e-mail address. We also track certain information, in the aggregate, on pages and features that users access or view.

  
Users electing to subscribe to newsletters or magazines, enter contests or to access special sections, are required to supply certain personal information during a "registration" process. Information collected through these forms may be used by Roland DGA Corporation to gather broad demographic information about our users in general, and to perform statistical analysis of user behavior in order to measure interest in the various areas of our Website.

  
Roland DGA Corporation may periodically send out e-mail newsletters to our users about products, services, clinic schedules or other news using e-mail addresses provided at registration or otherwise. Upon request, Roland DGA Corporation will remove users (and their information) from our database or permit them to "opt-out" of any further e-mail newsletter lists. If you receive any such e-mail messages that you do not wish to receive again in the future, simply send an email to webmaster@rolanddga.com and place the word “remove” in the subject line of your email.

  
If you provide us with any personal information, such as address, e-mail, telephone and fax numbers, as well as demographic and customer identification, we will not disclose (share, sell or divulge) it to third parties unless we have informed you, been authorized by you, or are required to do so by law. Roland DGA Corporation will maintain this information in accordance with our strict security and confidentiality standards. To change or update your personal information please send a "remove" email (as explained above) and re-register with the new information.

  
This Website contains links to other Websites. Roland DGA Corporation is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Websites.

  
Roland DGA Corporation uses reasonable precautions to keep the personal information disclosed to us secure. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. Nonetheless, Roland DGA Corporation does not guarantee the security, accuracy or completeness of any such information or procedures.
