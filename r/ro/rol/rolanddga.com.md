Nonetheless, Roland DGA Corporation does not guarantee the security, accuracy or completeness of any such information or procedures.

> Some of our sites may enable you to participate in public services such as discussion boards, chats, and live events. Please use discretion when providing personal information about yourself when using these services. Be aware that when you disclose personal information at these sites, the information may be collected and used by others to send unsolicited messages. These services are open to the public, and what you post there can be seen by anyone and is not protected.
