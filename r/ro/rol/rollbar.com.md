**Data Collected**

We collect anonymous data from every visitor of the Website to monitor traffic and fix bugs. For example, we collect information like web requests, the data sent in response to such requests, the Internet Protocol address, the browser type, the browser language, and a timestamp for the request.

We ask you to log in and provide certain personal information (such as your email address and Github login) in order to be able to save your profile and the accounts, projects, and other data associated with it. In order to enable these or any other login based features, we use cookies to store session information for your convenience. Cookies are required to use the Website. In order to take advantage of certain features of the Website, you may also choose to provide us with other personal information, such as your picture or personal website, but your decision to utilize these features and provide such data will always be voluntary.

You can also modify your notification preferences by clicking the appropriate link included in the footer of email notifications.

**Use of the Data**

We only use your personal information to provide you the Rollbar services or to communicate with you about the services or the Website.

With respect to any data you may upload to Rollbar (through our API or otherwise), we take the privacy and confidentiality of such data seriously.

We employ industry standard techniques to protect against unauthorized access of data about you that we store, including personal information.

**We do not share personal information you have provided to us without your consent** , unless:

  * doing so is appropriate to carry out a user's request;
  * we believe it's needed to enforce our Terms of Service, or that is legally required;
  * we believe it's needed to detect, prevent or address fraud, security or technical issues;
  * otherwise protect our property, legal rights, or that of others.



Rollbar is operated from the United States. If you are visiting the Website from outside the U.S., you agree to any processing of any personal information you provide us according to this policy.

Rollbar may contact you, by email or other means. For example, Rollbar may send you promotional emails relating to Rollbar or other third parties Rollbar feels you would be interested in, or communicate with you about your use of the Rollbar website. Rollbar may also use technology to alert us via a confirmation email when you open an email from us. If you do not want to receive email from Rollbar, please opt out of receiving emails at the bottom of any Rollbar emails or by editing you profile preferences.

**Sharing of Data**

We don't sell your personal information to third parties. Aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to help us improve the Rollbar Website and service, and in some cases your user identifiers (your username or email address) may be transmitted to external services for the same reason. We currently use Google Analytics (traffic analysis, SEO optimization), Mixpanel (analytics), and Intercom (analytics). We listed below what data these third parties extract exactly. Feel free to check out their own Privacy Policies to find out more.

  * Google Analytics: anonymous (ad serving domains, browser type, demographics, language settings, page views, time/date), pseudonymous (IP address)
  * Mixpanel: anonymous, pseudonymous, registered users' activity
  * Intercom: registered users' activity



We may also use social buttons provided by services like Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn and Facebook. Your use of these third party services is entirely optional. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices of these third party services, and you are responsible for reading and understanding those third party services' privacy policies.

We employ and contract with people and other entities that perform certain tasks on our behalf and who are under our control (our "Agents"). We may need to share personal information with our Agents in order to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, our Agents do not have any right to use Personal Information or other information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information with our Agents.

We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

**Changes to the Privacy Policy**

We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes in the way we collect or use information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Website or sending you an email. A user is bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when he or she uses the Services after such changes have been first posted.
