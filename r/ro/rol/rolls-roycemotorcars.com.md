# Privacy Policy

Rolls-Royce Motor Cars is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. We will only use your personal information in accordance with the data protection law in the UK and this privacy policy.

This policy sets out the basis on which personal data we hold, in particular personal data relating to our customers and prospective customers, will be processed by us.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may modify or update this privacy policy from time to time.  If we change this privacy policy, the changes will be published here on this website. Where changes to this privacy policy will have a fundamental impact on the nature of the processing or otherwise have a substantial impact on you, we will give you sufficient advance notice so that you have the opportunity to exercise any rights you may have (e.g. to object to the processing).  

### Legal grounds for processing of your personal information

Our use of personal data is permitted under UK data protection law on the basis of the following principal legal grounds:

  * Where necessary to enter into or perform a contract with you
  * Where needed to comply with our legal obligations
  * Where necessary in order to protect your or someone else’s, vital interests (in life threatening situations such as following an accident)
  * Where we use it to achieve a legitimate interest and our reasons for using it outweigh any prejudice to your data protection rights, (our legitimate interests include promoting our business and tailoring news and offers to you, research and development of vehicle related products and services, detecting fraud and criminal activities)
  * Where you have consented to the use (you will have been presented with a consent notice in relation to any such use and may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us.



There may be uses that are permitted on the basis of other grounds; where this is the case we will use reasonable endeavours to identify the ground and communicate it you as soon as possible after becoming aware of the new basis.

### Location Information Safeguards (from using your information)

If you have chosen services that disclose your location or the location of your vehicle, we take the confidentiality of that information very seriously.

The following safeguards are applied to Location Information (including information accessed as part of the vehicle service process):

  * It is only kept for as long as necessary to fulfil the service.
  * It is only obtained or accessed in that form where necessary to provide the service requested or where we are obliged to retain and/or provide the information by law (and where we are required to provide the information to law enforcement or any other third party, we will - notify you unless to do so would prejudice the prevention or detection of a crime or we are not permitted to do so).
  * Vehicle Location Information and Device Location Information are not linked unless necessary to provide the service requested.
  * Any other use of Location Information for analytics purposes will be undertaken on irreversibly anonymised data.



You will have been provided with a detailed description of the Location Information obtained to provide a Location Information dependent service when you initially purchased the vehicle or activated or configured the service or application (e.g. Teleservices or mobile app). You can control whether we continue to hold or collect that information through the vehicle, service or application so future Location Information ceases to be collected. Please note that we may not be able to provide certain features of our services to you if you limit the collection of your Location Information.
