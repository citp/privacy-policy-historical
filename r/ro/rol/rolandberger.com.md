## 3\. What data do we collect?

## 3.1 Some data is collected automatically

When you visit our websites, your IP address is recorded, along with the data you requested from the website, how much data you downloaded, the server reply code on the request from your browser, what browser you used, the date you visited, and for how long.

Roland Berger Strategy Consultants cannot attribute this data to any specific person as a general rule (unless you log in). We do not combine this data with data from any other sources.

We statistically analyze this data constantly so we can keep our websites optimized at all times.

## 3.2 Some information you provide

We record and process information you enter on our websites or send us otherwise. This includes data you enter in forms or contact fields, or select from lists or menus.

There are some points in our websites where you can send us information by uploading documents via those websites to our servers. That is what happens when you apply online, for example (refer to the [supplementary data protection statement for applicants  ](https://application.rolandberger.info/cms/en/career/online-application/application-autoregister.html)).

We also record and process personal information when you e-mail someone at Roland Berger. This concerns the contents of your e-mails as such, but also data obtained from queries to our e-mail server, such as sender and addressee IDs, time stamp, errors or grounds for refusal if mail doesn't get through.

## 3.2.1 Profile and login information for access-protected areas

There are some access-restricted areas of the website for which you need to register before you can use them, like the recruiting/applicant and alumni areas in particular. When registering, there are some details you have to enter that the registration form itself requires, particularly your e-mail address, a password, and some information about yourself. Any other details you enter are voluntary. We process and save this data (refer to the [supplementary data protection statement for applicants  ](https://application.rolandberger.info/cms/en/career/online-application/application-autoregister.html)).

In some areas of our websites, like our alumni network in particular, some of your registration data or contributions you make can be seen by other users once they log in. It's up to you to decide whether you want other registered users of this site to see your information and, if so, what. You can change these settings at any time.

## 3.2.2 Newsletters and information services

There are many points on Roland Berger Strategy Consultants' websites where we offer newsletters or comparable information services. If you'd like to use these, we'll need a working e-mail address for you and details to enable us to verify that this e-mail address is really yours, or that the person whose address it is agrees to receive the newsletter. That's the only information we gather.

You can withdraw your consent to your data and e-mail address being recorded and used to send newsletters at any time.

## 3.2.3 Web Analytics

Information on using etracker GmbH's Web Analytics technology:

On this website, data is temporarily collected and saved on a test basis using technology provided by etracker GmbH ([www.etracker.com  ](http://www.etracker.com/en/)) for the purposes of marketing and optimization. Usage profiles with a pseudonym can be created using this data via cookies. The data collected with etracker technology is not used to personally identify website users, unless they give their specific consent, and not combined with personal data about the bearer of the pseudonym. Users can, at any time, [refuse  ](http://www.etracker.de/privacy?et=XdE73b) permission for their data to be collected and saved in the future.

Roland Berger Strategy Consultants uses web analysis on their web pages using the data protection option of "Extended data protection conformity". This means that complete IP addresses are not processed and are only saved for a short period of time. To sanitize the IP addresses, they are shortened to the last 8 bits.

In order to improve content, we will analyze the categories of "Visitors" (number and frequency), "Usage" (content, entry/exit pages, click habits), "Origin" (country, search machines) and access technologies of "Web" and "Mobile".

## 3.2.4 Other

We will never record any of your personal details otherwise without your ex-press consent.
