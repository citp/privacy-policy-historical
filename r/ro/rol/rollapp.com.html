	<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
</div>
	<div class="txt"><p>rollApp is committed to protecting your privacy when you visit our web-site <a href="http://www.rollapp.com">www.rollApp.com</a> and use our online or 
		other services ("Services"). In this policy we explain how and why we collect your information, what we do with it 
		and what controls you have over our use of it.</p>
		<p>From time to time, we add or change functions, features or products to our website or add or change Services. This, as well as our commitment to protecting the privacy of your
personal information, may result in periodic changes to this Privacy Policy. Please remember to refer back to this Privacy Policy regularly to review any amendments.</p>
	</div>
<div class="heading">
	<h2>Information We Collect And How We Use It</h2>
</div>
	<div class="txt"><p>We may collect the following types of information:
		</p><ul>
		<li><span>Information you provide</span> — When you sign up for a&nbsp;rollApp Account, we may ask you for&nbsp;personal 
		information. We may combine the information you submit under your account with information from third parties in 
		order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services. For certain services, we 
		may give you the opportunity to opt out of combining such information.</li>
		<li><span>Cookies</span> — When you visit rollApp, we may send one or more&nbsp;cookies&nbsp;to your computer or other 
		device. We may use cookies to improve the quality of our service, including for storing user preferences, improving 
		search results and ad selection, and tracking user trends, such as how people search. Most browsers are initially 
		set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is 
		being sent. However, some rollApp features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.</li>
		<li><span>Log information</span> — When you access rollApp services via a browser, application or other client, 
		our servers may automatically record certain information. These&nbsp;server logs&nbsp;may include information such as your web 
		request, your interaction with a service, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and 
		time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your account.</li>
		<li><span>User communications</span> — When you send email or other communications to rollApp, we may retain 
		those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services. We may 
		use your email address to communicate with you about our services.</li>
		<li><span>Third Party Components and Applications</span> — rollApp makes available some third party components 
		and applications through rollApp website. The information collected by rollApp when you enable a third party 
		application is processed under this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;Information collected by the third party application/component 
		provider is governed by their privacy policies.</li>
		<li><span>Other sites</span> — This Privacy Policy applies to rollApp services only. We do not exercise control 
		over the sites that use components provided by rollApp, link to rollApp website or are linked from rollApp website. 
		These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal 
		information from you.</li>
		</ul>
		<p></p>
		
		<p>
		In addition to the above, we may use the information we collect to:
		</p><ul>
		<li>Provide, maintain, protect, and improve our services (including advertising services) and develop new services; and</li>
		<li>Protect the rights or property of rollApp or our users.</li>
		</ul>
		<p></p>			

		<p>If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for 
		your consent prior to such use.</p>
		<p>rollApp processes personal information on our servers in the United States of America and in other countries. 
		In some cases, we process personal information outside your own country.</p>
	</div>

<div class="heading">
	<h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
</div>	
		<div class="txt"><p>rollApp recognizes the privacy interests of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active 
		role in their children's online activities and interests. Our Services are not intended for children under the age 
		of 13. rollApp does not target its Services or its website to children under 13. rollApp does not knowingly collect 
		personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.</p></div>
		
<div class="heading">
	<h2>Information Sharing</h2>
</div>
		<div class="txt"><p>rollApp only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of rollApp in the 
		following limited circumstances:
		</p><ul>
		<li>We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.</li>
		<li>We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons 
		for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process 
		such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate 
		confidentiality and security measures.</li>
		<li>We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably 
		necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, 
		(b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, 
		prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, 
		property or safety of rollApp, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>
		</ul>		
		<p></p>
		
		<p>If rollApp becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we 
		will ensure the confidentiality of any personal information involved in such transactions and provide notice 
		before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p></div>
		
<div class="heading">
	<h2>Logging In To rollApp</h2>
</div>
		<div class="txt"><p>rollApp provides its users with the ability to create a new account, or sign-in to an existing account using 
		their Google, Twitter, Facebook or other Open ID credentials. If you choose to use a third party ID to sign in to 
		rollApp, the first time you select this option you may be prompted by the third party service to allow rollApp 
		the privilege of being able to access/post content on/to your third party service (i.e. Facebook). The third party 
		service may also ask if you want to allow rollApp access to your email address and/or some other information. Accepting 
		these requests allows you to use your third party ID credentials to access rollApp, and also signals your acceptance of 
		rollApp’s Terms of Service. If you choose to revoke these privileges from rollApp, you can do so at any time by accessing 
		the applicable applications settings under your third party service.</p></div>
		
<div class="heading">
	<h2>Information Security</h2>
</div>	
		<div class="txt"><p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure 
		or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and 
		security measures, including appropriate encryption and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access 
		to systems where we store personal data.</p>
		<p>We restrict access to personal information to rollApp employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information 
		in order to process it on our behalf. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to 
		discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.</p></div>
		
<div class="heading">
	<h2>Accessing And Updating Personal Information</h2>
</div>	
		<div class="txt"><p>When you use rollApp services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and 
		either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to 
		be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information 
		requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that 
		are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or 
		would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access 
		is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of 
		charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Because of the way we maintain certain services, after 
		you delete your information, residual copies may take a period of time before they are deleted from our active servers and 
		may remain in our backup systems.</p></div>
		
<div class="heading">
	<h2>Notification Of Changes</h2>
</div>
		<div class="txt"><p>Due to the Internet's rapidly evolving nature, rollApp may need to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we 
		decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this Privacy Policy, the home page, and other places we 
		deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, 
		we disclose it.  We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make 
		material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.</p></div>
