    <p>Our internal data security policies restrict access to customers' personal information to authorized employees. Authorized employees may use our customers' personal information for Glam Media business purposes only. Our employees are bound by Glam Media policies that require them to maintain the confidentiality of our customers' personal information. Employees who violate these requirements are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.<br>
   We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that are designed to guard our customers' personal information. For example, for the security of your online visit to a Glam Media Site, we may make use of firewall barriers, encryption techniques, and/or authentication procedures. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Glam Media cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. In the event of a breach of the confidentiality or security of your personal information, we will notify you as necessary so you can take appropriate protective steps. Unless you indicate otherwise, we may notify you under such circumstances using the e-mail address you provided to us when you registered with the Glam Media Site.</p>
    <h2><a name="_OurDataSharingPractices" class="style1" id="_OurDataSharingPractices"><em>Our Data Sharing Practices</em></a> </h2>

We may share your personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information with third parties, or affiliates of Glam Media where it is necessary for us to complete a transaction or do something you have asked us to do. For example, we might need to provide your personally identifiable information to third parties, such as advertisers, featured on a Glam Media Site, or through a website participating in the Glam Media Network or a Non-Affiliated Site so they can process and fulfill your request for more information from them; and in these instances, we will provide you with a notice at the time of collection that the information is being shared, to whom it is being shared and the privacy policy governing the use of the information collected and shared. We may share your personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information with third parties with whom we have contracted to perform services on our behalf, or affiliates of Glam Media.

    <p>We may disclose personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information about our customers as permitted or required by law, such as in connection with a subpoena or similar legal process, or in connection with a merger, acquisition, or bankruptcy, as discussed further below.</p>
    <h2><a name="_OurDataRetentionPolicy" id="_OurDataRetentionPolicy"><em>Our Data Retention Policy</em></a> </h2>
    <p>Glam Media is required to retain certain non–personally identifiable information collected from users of the Glam Media Sites, Affiliated Sites and Non-Affiliated Sites in order to provide audited information to advertisers and auditors.&nbsp; As a result, ad reporting and delivery data is retained for a period of 18 months. After 18 months, some of &nbsp;the ad reporting and delivery data may be aggregated for statistical purposes and retained indefinitely. Log files that associate individual advertising with a specific IP address will be retained by Glam Media for 18 months and during that time will be used for internal analysis and ad delivery purposes. Certain aggregated, non-personally identifiable information including historical data and attributes collected by Glam Media prior to an opt out election and which represent large numbers of users combined into aggregated statistical data and information shall be kept for 18 months and despite the fact that the user has opted out, the information will continue to be associated with the users cookie regardless of the opt out status.
