# Rodan + Fields

Rodan + Fields LLC (“Rodan + Fields,” “we,” “us”) is concerned about privacy issues and wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose Personally Identifiable Information (as defined below) about you that you provide us through RodanandFields.com (the "Site"). Please note that this Privacy Policy governs only information provided to Rodan + Fields. It does not govern our collection of information through any website, or by any other means, other than through the Site; nor does this Privacy Policy govern the collection of information by Rodan + Fields Independent Consultants who distribute and market Rodan + Fields products ("Consultants").

By using the Site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and our **Terms and conditions** If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy and our **Terms and Conditions** , please do not use the Site. We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy without prior notice. You can determine when this Privacy Policy was last revised by referring to the " _Last Updated_ " legend at the top of this page. Any changes to our Privacy Policy will become effective upon our posting of the revised Policy on the Site. Use of the Site following such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy then in effect.

**1.**     **Collection of Information by Rodan + Fields**

Rodan + Fields collects two basic types of information through the Site:  "Personally Identifiable Information" ("PII") and "Non-Personally Identifiable Information" ("Non-PII"). Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies you as an individual. Non-Personally Identifiable Information is aggregated information, demographic information, IP addresses and any other information that does not reveal your specific identity.

**a.**     **Personally Identifiable Information**

You do not have to provide PII to use the Site. However, to take advantage of particular opportunities provided through the Site (for example, to sign up for newsletters) or to place orders for Rodan + Fields products, we may require that you furnish PII. We collect PII from you through the Site only when you voluntarily provide it to us. For example, if you decide to complete a user registration form, complete an online survey or make a purchase, you may be asked to provide certain information such as your contact information (name, email address, mailing address, and telephone number).  If you decide to place an order, we will also need to know your delivery and billing address, credit card number and expiration date. To protect PII, users registering at the Site must also enter a user name/email address and password. If you would prefer that we not collect any PII from you, please do not provide us with any such information.

When you submit PII on the Site, you are giving your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of PII about you as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

**b.**     Non-Personally Identifiable Information

When you visit and interact with the Site, Rodan + Fields and third parties with whom Rodan + Fields has contracted to provide services to it may collect Non-PII (for example, a catalog of the Site pages you visit). Non-PII is generally collected through the Site from five different sources:  server log files, environmental variables, cookies, pixel tags and other similar technologies and information that you voluntarily provide.

i.      **Server Log Files.** Your Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This number is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Site, along with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited. We use your IP address, and the IP addresses of all users, for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose problems with the Site's servers, administering the Site, analyzing trends, administering the Site, tracking traffic patterns, and gathering demographic information for aggregate use. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many websites.

ii.     **Environmental Variables.** We and our service providers may also collect certain environmental variables, such as your MAC address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, OS version, Internet browser, and Internet browser version. These environmental variables are collected by most browsers, and can be used to optimize your experience on the Site.

iii.    **Cookies and IP Addresses.** We and our service providers may use “cookies” on the Site. Cookies are data that a web server transfers to an individual's computer for recordkeeping purposes. Cookies are an industry standard used by most websites, and can facilitate users' ongoing access to and use of a particular website; cookies do not cause damage to your computer systems or files. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies, or to be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer of a particular cookie, or cookies from a particular website, to your computer.

We are continuously working to make your experience on our Site better. To this end, we have retained Coremetrics, to assist us in better understanding your use of our Site. Coremetrics will place cookies on your computer to collect information on our behalf that will show us how you come to our site and how you use and navigate our Site. Coremetrics is contractually required to maintain all information collected on our behalf in confidence. However, you may elect to limit or eliminate the data that Coremetrics collects regarding your use of our Site.

Some of our other business partners and service providers may also use cookies on the Site. However, we have no access to, or control over, these cookies and do not accept any responsibility for such use. Only Coremetrics cookies may be accepted or declined as described in the preceding paragraph.

iv.    **Pixel Tags.** We and our service providers may also use so-called "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs" or similar means (collectively, "Pixel Tags") in connection with some Site pages and HTML-formatted e-mail messages to, among other things, compile aggregate statistics about Site usage and response rates. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel (1x1), that is ordinarily not visible to Site visitors and may be associated with Cookies on the visitors’ hard drives. Pixel Tags allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Site, to deliver branded services, and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted e-mail messages, Pixel Tags can tell the sender whether and when the e-mail has been opened.

v.     **Information That You Voluntarily Provide.** Rodan + Fields also collects Non-PII ( _e.g._ , your interests, your geographic location, age group, gender and product and/or cosmetic concerns, and the brands and products you use) when you voluntarily provide such information to us. When such information is not combined with any PII, such information is considered to be Non-PII, as it does not personally identify you or any other user. Additionally, we may aggregate PII in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site, for example, by using PII to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code. Such aggregate information is considered Non-PII for purposes of this Policy.  Please note that if we combine any Non-PII with PII, the combined information will be treated by us as PII as long as it is so combined.

**2.**     **Use of Personally Identifiable Information by Rodan + Fields**

i.      **Fulfillment of Requests.** Rodan + Fields may use PII about you to for the purposes detailed in this policy including to send newsletters to you or fulfill your purchase.

ii.     **Administrative Communications.** From time to time we may use PII about you to send to you important information regarding the Site, or changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. If you have elected to provide us with your contact information, e.g., by registering on the Site, emailing our Customer Service department or placing an order, we may provide you with service related announcements concerning the Site or contact you regarding your customer service requests or your order. For example, all registered users will receive a welcoming email to confirm their registration. These types of communications are necessary to serve you, respond to your concerns and to provide the high level of customer service that Rodan + Fields offers its customers.

i.      **Aggregate Information.** We may use the information you provide in aggregate (Non-PII) form for internal business purposes, such as generating statistics and developing marketing plans.

**c.**     In some instances, we may combine Non-PII with PII (such as embedding e-mail addresses in cookies). If we do combine any Non-PII with PII, the combined information will be treated by us as PII as long as it is so combined (see **Section 2.a** above).
