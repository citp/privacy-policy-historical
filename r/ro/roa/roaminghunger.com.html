  <p>
      We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time.  If we make changes,
      we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in
      some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a
      statement to our homepage or sending you a notification).  We encourage
      you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services or
