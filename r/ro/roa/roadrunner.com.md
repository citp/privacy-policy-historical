**Welcome to Time Warner Cable's Road Runner Website Privacy Policy**

The information Time Warner Cable collects about you at [http://www.rr.com](http://www.rr.com/), and the subdomains thereof (the "Site" or "Website") is used to administer the Website and to provide information to Website visitors about the Site's various services and tools, and to provide general news, information and entertainment. Time Warner Cable, together with Road Runner and Time Warner Cable-affiliated cable operators, are collectively referred to in this Privacy Policy as "we," "us," "our" or other similar pronouns, or "Time Warner Cable."

**What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?**

This Privacy Policy (the "Privacy Policy") applies to your use of the Website. This Privacy Policy does not govern Time Warner Cable's treatment of information it collects and receives about you other than through this Website, for example in connection with any other services provided to you by Time Warner Cable.

This Privacy Policy covers how Time Warner Cable treats information that Time Warner Cable collects and receives about you via this Website, including the personal information we collect through the various features, services, and software that we use to provide the Site to you.

**How Does Time Warner Cable Collect and Use Information About You?**

Time Warner Cable will not share your personally identifiable information with third parties for their marketing purposes without your consent.

By having this information, Web pages optimized for a particular visitor's preferences are automatically made available to that visitor. Other use of this information may include review of the number of visitors to this Site as well other internal and administrative purposes. 

Personally identifiable data (as further described below) about visitors to this Site are collected by Time Warner Cable, for example, when users register or subscribe for newsletters, accounts or features on our Website, make online purchases, enter sweepstakes and contests, complete surveys, contribute to a chat room, message board, blog, or other similar open forum on our Website, submit a comment or question to us using a "contact us" or similar feature on our Website, or send us an e-mail, or in any other way submit personal information to us via our Website.

We may use your personally identifiable information to send you notices (for example, in the form of e-mails, mailings, and the like), and otherwise correspond with you, about products, services, companies and events, sponsored by us and others, that we think might interest you.

Time Warner Cable sites (other than this Site), as well as any other third party sites linked to from this Site, may each have different privacy policies and practices. Time Warner Cable is not responsible for the information practices of non-Time Warner Cable sites, or channels or areas of this Site, that are operated by third parties. You should carefully review these other privacy policies in order to determine how each third party may use any personal information you provide.

Time Warner Cable receives and stores certain types of website usage information whenever you interact with our Website. Here are the types of website usage information Time Warner Cable gathers and how it is used.

**Cookies**

We may use "cookies" to keep, and sometimes track, information about you. Cookies are small data files that are sent to your browser or related software from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies track where you travel on our Web site and what you look at and purchase. They may store, for example, the information in your shopping cart, and/or your username and/or password. All of these purposes serve to improve and personalize your experience on our Website.

Most Web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie. Additionally, if you have a Flash player installed on your computer, your Flash player can be set to reject or delete Flash cookies (technically known as Flash "local shared objects"). However, refusing a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, the Web site or certain areas or features of the Web site.

**Clear GIFs**

We may use "clear GIFs" (aka "Web beacons" or "pixel tags") or similar technologies, in the Website and/or in our communications with you, for example, to enable us to know whether you have visited a Web page or received a message. A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a Web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the Internet enabling the verification of an individual's viewing or receipt of a Web page or message.

**IP Address and Clickstream Data**

Our server automatically collects data about your server's Internet address when you visit us. This information, known as an Internet Protocol address, or IP Address, is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider (i.e., if you are using your Road Runner account, us) whenever you're on the Internet. When you request pages from our Website, our servers may log your IP Address and sometimes your domain name. Our server may also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another site or a search engine); the pages you visit on this Website; the site you visit after this Website; the ads you see and/or click on; other information about the type of Web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on this Website or a referral site; and other Web usage activity and data logged by our Web servers. We use this information for internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Website. Such information may also be used to gather broad demographic information, such as country of origin and Internet Service Provider.

Ads and Content displayed to you on the Site may be customized to your interests and preferences, based on your personal information and web site usage information, including (but not limited to) non-personally identifying information, which we may obtain from you or from other sources.

Any or all of these activities with regard to web site usage Information may be performed on our behalf by our services providers.

**Short Message Service**

We may make available a service through which you can receive messages on your wireless device via short message service ("SMS Service"). If you subscribe to one of our SMS Services, you thereby agree to receive SMS Service messages at the address you provide for such purposes from Time Warner Cable.

Your wireless carrier's standard rates apply to these messages, and you may change your mind at any time by following the instructions on the Site or in the message you receive. You represent that you are the owner or authorized user of the wireless device you use to sign up for the SMS Service, and that you are authorized to approve the applicable charges. To use the SMS Service, you must be 18 years of age or older and reside in the United States. You must first register and provide all required Personal Information, which may include, for example, your name, SMS address, wireless carrier and, if fees are applicable to the SMS Service you subscribe to, billing information (either your credit card information or mobile service carrier information if applicable fees will be billed through your carrier). We may also obtain the date, time and content of your messages in the course of your use of the SMS Service. We will use the information we obtain in connection with our SMS Service in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If fees are charged to your wireless account invoice, we may provide your carrier with your applicable information in connection therewith. Your wireless carrier and other service providers may also collect data about your wireless device usage, and their practices are governed by their own policies.

You acknowledge and agree that the SMS Service is provided via wireless systems which use radios (and other means) to transmit communications over complex networks. We do not guarantee that your use of the SMS Service will be private or secure, and we are not liable to you for any lack of privacy or security you may experience. You are fully responsible for taking precautions and providing security measures best suited for your situation and intended use of the SMS Service. We may also access the content of your account and/or wireless account with your carrier for the purpose of identifying and resolving technical problems and/or service-related complaints.
