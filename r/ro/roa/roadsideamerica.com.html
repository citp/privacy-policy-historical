<h1>RoadsideAmerica.com Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="specialnote">This policy describes how www.RoadsideAmerica.com treats personal information www.RoadsideAmerica.com collects and receives. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable, such as your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.</p>
<p class="specialnote">This policy does not apply to the practices of web sites RoadsideAmerica.com does not own or control, or to people that RoadsideAmerica.com does not employ or manage. In addition, companies providing hotel booking, travel services, and merchandise to RoadsideAmerica.com in an affiliate relationship have their own privacy statements which can be viewed by clicking on the links on those sites.</p>
<p class="specialnote">Consent Note: RoadsideAmerica.com cookies are in effect on the browser and device where they are saved. We don't track your consent across devices or between browsers, so you may see the Privacy and Terms consent banner presented for each initial use of our web site, and on every page if you block cookies.</p>
<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>RoadsideAmerica.com collects information from you when you use the website, sign up to receive our newsletter, voluntarily submit a roadside attraction tip, photo, video, feedback form or email, and provide us with your comments and other content.</p>
<p><strong>Roadside America Newsletter:</strong> When you voluntarily sign up to receive our newsletter, you provide your email address to enable us to send you the newsletter. When you submit information through our contact form or post comments, you provide your name, email address, and any other information you decide to provide.</p>
<p><strong>Roadside America Tip Submission:</strong> If you submit a new or updated attraction suggestion for inclusion in our collection of roadside attractions, you provide us with your email address (so we can verify the origin of the submission and contact you if it is published) and a username (so we can publish a credit for the tip). For your privacy protection we do not publish your email address without your consent. If you submit a tip accompanied by an explicit request to publish your email address, the decision to publish that information is solely at our discretion. Tip contributor contact information and source content may be retained in our internal company files only for as long as RoadsideAmerica.com determines it is necessary.</p>
<p>If you create an Account on RoadsideAmerica.com for the purposes of accessing special tools or content, you provide us with an email address and username.</p>
<p>
<strong>Roadside America Mobile Apps:</strong> If you create an Account for the Roadside America iPhone app and make a region in-app purchase, the Apple App Store will verify the transaction. Apple does not give us access to your personal Apple data. Our apps are used under these End User License Agreements to which the user consented to before purchasing.  </p><ul class="featurelist"><li><a href="https://www.roadsideamerica.com/mobile/roadside/ios/eula">Roadside America app End User License Agreement</a></li><li><a href="https://www.roadsideamerica.com/mobile/presidents/ios/eula">Roadside Presidents app End User License Agreement</a></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>RoadsideAmerica.com may collect anonymous data from you in the process of delivering a service you are using. For example, to email a My Sights trip you created to a friend, RoadsideAmerica.com stores the trip name and our site's attraction ID numbers -- but no email addresses or other personal information.</p>
<p>
<strong>Ads:</strong> RoadsideAmerica.com displays ads that are provided by an advertising network.

We may use information for the following general purposes: to customize the advertising and content, improve our services, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients. We and service providers acting on our behalf, such as Google Analytics, use Log Files and tracking technologies to collect and analyze certain types of technical information, including cookies, IP addresses, device type, device identifiers, browser types, browser language, referring and exit pages, and URLs, platform type, the number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, date and time of activity on our websites or applications, and other similar information. In some cases, we will associate this information with a user ID number for our internal use. End users can choose to <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">opt out of Google Analytics</a>.</p>
<h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

</p>
<p>
<strong>Roadside America Trip Tools</strong>: Cookies enable you to mark and save attractions to display in your maps and lists on our website. Roadside America's My Sights and Trip Planner tools won't work if you disable cookies. At any time you can delete your browser cookies and that data. Note: If you mail a trip to someone, My Sights creates a file on our server with the trip name and list of places. Only you have this trip data URL, though you can share it with others.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Advertising</strong>: Ads help us to provide RoadsideAmerica.com at no cost to you. We partner with ad services such as Google AdSense to show ads to our visitors. Ad services may use cookies for purposes such as to stop you from seeing the same ad over and over, to detect and stop click fraud, and to show ads that are likely to be more relevant (such as ads based on websites you visited). Google provides controls so that you can choose to see personalized or non-personalized ads. Find out <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads">more about Google ads</a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Affiliate Links</strong>: RoadsideAmerica.com provides links to a small number of trusted travel services partners, such as hotel information suppliers.

</p>
<p>
<strong>Embedded Videos</strong>: RoadsideAmerica.com embeds videos in some of our pages that are hosted on third party websites, such as Google YouTube. YouTube places cookies on your browser when the page is loaded, or the video is played. Learn more about <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/types">cookie types used by Google</a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Website Analytics</strong>: We use aggregated information about our site traffic to investigate and fix site issues, and to improve the user experience. We use services such as Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with our site. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can install the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">Google Analytics browser add-on</a>. Learn more about <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245">Google Analytics and privacy</a>.

<p>
We implement a variety of security measures to protect the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information. While we take reasonable measures to protect the information you submit against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. No Internet, email, or mobile application transmission is ever fully secure or error free. Email or other messages sent through the website may not be secure. You should use caution when submitting information through the website and take special care in deciding with which information you provide us.</p>
<p>
We cannot guarantee that transmissions of your personal information will be fully secure and that third parties will never be able to defeat our security measures or the security measures of our service providers. We assume no liability for disclosure of your information due to transmission errors, third party access, or causes beyond our control.
