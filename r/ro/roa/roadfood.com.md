Teneology, Inc. DBA Fexy Media (“Fexy,” “we,” “our,” and/or “us”) operates a platform that helps people discover and enjoy new recipes and meals. This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) explains how we collect, use, and share your personal information. We own and operate several websites and apps (individually “Fexy Site” or “Fexy App,” collectively “Fexy Sites and Apps”). This Privacy Policy applies to those websites, apps, and any Fexy Sites and Apps that we operate, including Roadfood.com, or any online service where this Privacy Policy is posted (our “Services”).

**Personal Information We Collect**

**Registration Information.** You may be able to register for a Fexy account and/or another account on the Services. If you register for an account, we will receive any registration information you provide to us, for example, your name, username that you select, zip code, and email address. Note that we may migrate your account information to a single Fexy account as we develop our Services. If you decide to sign up for an account using a third-party account such as your Google account or your Facebook account, we will also get basic information from the profile associated with your account, such as your name and the email address associated with the account.

**Content Contributions.** You may be able to contribute to the Services in a variety of ways, for example filling out your profile, writing comments, etc. We may store these contributions and the dates and times you make them, and use them in different ways, including for display on the website.

For example, when you contact our customer support team, we may receive your name, email address, the contents of a message or attachments that you may send to us, and other information you choose to provide.
