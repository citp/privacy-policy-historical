<li>Roald Dahl's Marvellous Children's Charity, a member of the Roald Dahl Group. We will share with Roald Dahl's Marvellous Children's Charity details of information gathered through cookies on our site (which may include details of your age, your gender, your country of residence and your language, but we will not be able to identify you from this data) to enable it to help us administer our site and for internal operations (i.e. troubleshooting of technical issues that arise in relation to our site; testing of our site following resolution of such technical issues; analysis of statistics arising from the information collected about you (for example, to analyse the geographical location and age profile of individuals who make donations to the Charity via our site)), and so that the Charity can measure and understand the effectiveness of email newsletters and email marketing that are sent to you. Additionally, and only where you have expressly indicated (e.g. by ticking the relevant box on our site) that you wish to be kept up to date (via email) with the latest information and news about Roald Dahl, fundraising opportunities, events, campaigns and competitions, and information about the work of the Charity, we will share your name, email address, country of residence, date of birth and parent's email address (if you are under 13 years old) with Roald Dahl's Marvellous Children's Charity so that it can fulfil your wish to be contacted about those matters and to ensure that the emails sent to you are appropriate to your age group and/or country of residence (e.g. the Charity would not send an email to you asking you to make donations to Roald Dahl's Marvellous Children's Charity if you are under 13 years old). Where you apply via our site for a grant from Roald Dahl's Marvellous Children's Charity we will share the information you submit in that application with the Charity for the purposes of assessing your eligibility for that grant;</li>
