**What personally identifiable information does Roadfly.org collect from me?**

Roadfly.org collects information in several ways from different parts of our web site.

Some personal information is gathered when you register. During registration, Roadfly.org asks for your name and e-mail address, among other personal information. The more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able to customize your experience. Once you register, you are no longer anonymous to Roadfly.org--you are given a Roadfly.org ID number and User Name and are able to take full advantage of Roadfly.org's many offerings.

In addition to registration, we may ask you for personal information at other times; for example when you enter a sweepstakes, contest or promotion sponsored by Roadfly.org; when you make a purchase from the Roadfly.org store; when you post a Roadfly.org classified ad.; when you submit a listing for a web site; and when you report a problem with one of our sites or services. If you contact Roadfly.org, we may keep a record of that correspondence. Wherever Roadfly.org collects personal information, an effort is made to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page.
