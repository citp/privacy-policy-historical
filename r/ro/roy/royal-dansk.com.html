<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p><strong>Kelsen Group A/S and Campbell Soup Company Privacy Policy – PLEASE NOTE THAT AS OF 10/28/2007 WE HAVE MADE CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</strong> <br>
<br>
This website is owned and operated by Kelsen Group A/S, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary part of the Campbell Soup Company.<br>
<br>
Here at Campbell, we recognize that many visitors to our sites are  concerned about the information they provide to us, and how we treat  that information. So we've developed a Privacy Policy to address this  sensitive area. This policy is effective as of 10/28/07. We may from  time to time update this policy and invite you to review this page  periodically. In the event this policy changes, we will inform you by  posting an updated policy on this web page. All changes will go into  effect on the date that is posted in our policy. The new policy will  apply to all past and current users of this site and will replace any  prior policies. <br>
<br>
Some of our sites may be directed in whole or in part to children under  the age of 13. Our policy regarding these sites is described below under  the heading “<a href="http://www.campbellsoupcompany.com/privacy-policy#children">Children's Privacy Policy</a>.”  In addition, not all of our websites are subject to this policy. Please  see the list of affiliated websites not subject to this policy listed  under the heading “Links to Other Sites.” Whenever we refer to our  “sites” in this policy, we mean only those sites subject to this Privacy  Policy. <br>
<br>
If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy or our Children's Privacy Policy, you can contact us at:<br>
<a href="mailto:info@kelsen.com">info@kelsen.com</a><br>
<br>
Our offices are open from 9 a.m. - 7 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through  Friday. Please feel free to email us anytime by visiting our <a href="http://www.campbellsoupcompany.com/connect-with-campbell.aspx">Consumer Response Center</a>. We'll be happy to answer your questions or hear your concerns. <br>
<br>
<strong>Our Policy</strong><br>
At our sites, we do not collect personally-identifiable information from  individuals unless they provide it to us voluntarily and knowingly.  This means we do not require you to register or provide information to  us in order to view any of our sites. If you register in order to use  one or more of the many features of our sites, in addition to other  purposes described in this Privacy Policy, we use the information you  supply for the purpose of providing the services you've requested. These  features may include: <br>
<br>
• Opt in email like Meal Mail<br>
• Send to a friend<br>
• Recipe Box<br>
• Discussion board like the Kitchen Table <br>
<br>
Depending on the feature you have registered to use, we may collect one  or more of the following types of personally-identifiable information:  name, address, phone number, email address, username and password. If  you do not provide this information, you may not be able to register for  that or other features on the site. You can always access and review  your personally-identifiable information by visiting any of the sites on  which you have registered. In addition, you can correct factual errors  in your personally-identifiable information by editing your profile on  any of our sites. <br>
<br>
Creating, viewing and editing your personally-identifiable information  can only be done with a valid member-provided user id and password. <br>
<br>
If you specifically agree to follow-up contacts by us or ask to be put  on our mailing list when you register, we may contact you from time to  time. You can always change your preference for follow-up contacts or  opt out of any further contacts or services just by e-mailing us at any  time or by visiting the area of the site where you registered. However,  unless you specifically register to receive communication from a site,  that site will not contact you. <br>
<br>
Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we don't share the  information you give us with anyone outside of the Campbell Soup Company  family of companies. In certain instances, we may disclose your  personally-identifiable information when we have reason to believe that  it is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against  persons or entities who may be causing injury to you, Campbell Soup  Company or others. We may also disclose your personally identifiable  information when we believe the law requires it. In the event of a  merger, consolidation or sale or transfer of all or substantially all of  our company or its assets, it is possible that all user information  collected by this site will be transferred to the purchaser or the new  company. <br>
<br>
We may use the personal information you provide us to improve our  marketing and promotional efforts; to statistically analyze website  usage; and to improve our features and the content of our sites. You  would never be opted into a service you did not request. <br>
<br>
We may also use your personal information to customize the content that  our sites deliver to you. For example, we may customize the recipes,  product information and promotions we deliver to you based upon the  information you have previously provided to us. <br>
<br>
As an added convenience to you, when you register on anyone of our  sites, your id and password can be used across the family of Campbell  sites. Visit the Our Brands page, on campbellsoupcompany.com, for a list  of our sites. <br>
<br>
<strong>Cookies</strong><br>
Like most companies, we use “cookie” technology on our sites to collect  aggregate information. When you log into one of our sites, the cookie  tells us whether you've visited us before or are a new visitor. This  allows us to measure the appeal of our sites to new and return visitors.  The cookie doesn't track any personal information about you or provide  us with any way to contact you, and the cookie doesn't extract any  information from your computer. Cookies are simply the best way for us  to be able to offer you the most enjoyable and hassle-free online  environment. <br>
<br>
<strong>Contests and Sweepstakes</strong><br>
Our sites sometimes include notices of contests, sweepstakes or other  promotions we are conducting, and we may permit you to participate  electronically in some cases. If that occurs, we will use the  information you provide for the purpose of conducting the contest,  sweepstakes or promotion (e.g., to contact you if you're a winner). In  addition, we may participate in internet related promotions sponsored by  reputable third parties. In these instances, if you are a participant  in such promotions, we may provide certain personally-identifiable  information to these third parties in furtherance of the promotion.  These parties have agreed to hold this information in confidence, not  use it for any purpose except to carry out the requested service, and  honor Campbell's privacy and security policies in the way this  information is handled. <br>
<br>
<strong>Questionnaires and Surveys</strong><br>
From time to time, our sites may also be conducting questionnaires and  surveys. Survey information will be treated like all of the information  we collect, and it is used to help us improve the appeal of our products  and our sites. <br>
<br>
<strong>Third Parties Service Providers</strong><br>
We sometimes employ other companies and individuals to perform services  for us. For example, we hire agencies to help administer consumer  promotions, to analyze data, to fulfill orders you place, and to provide  customer service. These parties are required to maintain any personal  information they receive from you in confidence and may only use it in  connection with the services they are providing to us. <br>
<br>
<strong>When you Shop with Us</strong><br>
If you shop with us via our website, we collect the following  information: name, address, phone number, email address, billing  information including credit card number and expiration date as well as  information such as an alternative address for shipping purposes. We  only use your name, address, phone number, billing information/credit  card information to process your order. The email address you provide is  used for internal purposes only, such as confirming and tracking your  order. We may also contact you via email or regular mail from  time-to-time to keep you up-to-date on the latest news or to send you  our latest offerings. If you previously opted-in for email communication  and no longer wish to receive marketing emails from us, please opt-out  by visiting the area of the site where you registered or you may email  us at any time. <br>
<br>
<strong>Links to Other Sites</strong><br>
Our sites may contain links to other sites, including other sites that  are owned or operated by our affiliates or us. While we do our best to  make sure that every link to a non-affiliated site sends you to a  helpful place on the internet, we cannot guarantee the content of these  non-affiliated sites. The non-affiliated sites will always have their  own privacy policies. In addition, some of our affiliated sites also  have their own privacy policies and are not subject to this policy.  These affiliated sites include, but are not limited to: campbellsoup.ca;  campbells-soup.ru; campbellsoup.com.sg; campbellsoup.com.my;  campbellsoup.com.mx; campbellsoup.com.au; campbellsoup.de;  campbellsoup.be; campbellsoup.fi; campbellsoup.se; campbellsoup.com.hk;  campbellsoup.co.jp; campbellawayfromhome.com; stockpot.com;; erasco.de;  heisse-tasse.de; raguletto.de; aiki.be; devoslemmens.be; royco.be;  arnotts.com; labelsforeducation.ca; and gardennay.com. You should always  check the privacy policy of the specific site you're visiting to  understand your rights. <br>
<br>
<strong>Security</strong><br>
Campbell takes your privacy and security seriously, for this reason we  have established physical security measures including locked doors and  files, electronic security and managerial controls that limit the  potential for misuse of information by employees and contractors. <br>
<br>
<a name="children"><strong>Children's Privacy Policy</strong></a> <br>
<br>
<em>Children's Privacy Policy -- General</em> <br>
<br>
Some of our sites may be directed in whole or in part to children under  the age of 13. Generally, we do not directly or indirectly collect  personally-identifiable information from children under the age of 13 in  these areas. On some sites, children are allowed to send preprogrammed  messages to friends regarding a particular feature of the site. In these  instances, the child is prompted to enter the email addresses of his or  her friends and some other non-identifiable information, such as his or  her initials. This information is automatically discarded as soon as  the preprogrammed message is delivered. From time to time, however, we  may request limited personally-identifiable information in order to  conduct online contests or sweepstakes. Our practices with respect to  collection of personally-identifiable information from children under  the age of 13 are described below. We do not condition a child's  participation in an activity on the child's disclosing more personal  information than is reasonably necessary to engage in the activity. In  addition, a parent may at anytime review any personally-identifiable  information collected about their child under the age of 13, have this  information deleted and prohibit further collection or use of the  child's information (although this may require the child to forfeit any  prize won in a sweepstakes or contest). <br>
<br>
<em>Children's Privacy Policy - Information Collected in Contests and Sweepstakes</em> <br>
<br>
Some of our sites directed in whole or in part to children under the age of 13 occasionally offer contests and/or sweepstakes. <strong>Our  contests and sweepstakes are designed in such a manner that a child  under the age of 13 is not required to provide any personally-  identifiable information about him/herself (other than a parent's e-mail  address) prior to being named a winner.</strong> To participate in  these contests or sweepstakes, however, we may require the child to  provide a screen name and a parent's e-mail address. We send an email to  the parent notifying the parent that his/her child wishes to  participate in the contest or sweepstakes. The parent has the option to  withhold his/her consent to the child's participation. If the parent  does not withhold his/her consent and the child is a potential winner of  a prize in the sweepstakes or contest, the child is required to print a  form requesting, among other things, the parent (and not the child) to  provide the information necessary to award the prize, such as the  child's name, address, social security number and other personally  identifiable information. The parent is required to sign this form and  return it to us. <br>
<br>
The parental email address collected from each child is used solely to  obtain parental consent, and it is not provided to any third party  except those third parties we have engaged to assist us in running the  contest or sweepstakes. These third parties are required to maintain the  parental email in confidence and may only use it in connection with the  services they are providing to us. The information collected from  winners may be (i) used in advertising and promotional activities  relating to our contest and/or sweepstakes, which may include making  certain of this information publicly available, and (ii) passed on to  third parties for the purpose of awarding prizes, and, depending on the  type of prize, these third parties may not be prohibited from using the  information for purposes other than awarding the prize (such as  marketing or advertising). <strong>Again, please note that  personally-identifiable information (other than a parent's address) is  only collected from the parents of children under the age of 13 who have  potentially won a prize, and only after the parent consents to the  award of the prize and the disclosure of the information</strong>. <br>
<br>
<em>Children's Privacy Policy - Contact Information</em> <br>
<br>
If you have any questions about our Children's Privacy Policy, please do  not hesitate to contact us at the address, phone number or e-mail  address listed at the top of this Privacy Policy. <br>
