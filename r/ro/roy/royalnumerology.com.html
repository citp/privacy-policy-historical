	<h1>Why are you asking for this information?</h1>
		<p>Excellent question. I will use the information you fill up on the registration
form (given name at birth, date of birth) to make up your Free Numerology report.
This report will reveal startling insights about your life, your personality,
and your future that is personally relevant to you because it is specifically 
based on your birth information. This information will only be used to calculate 
and complete your Free Numerology Report.<br><br>

		If you enjoy your Free Report and like to find out more, you will be presented 
with the option to purchase additional, more in-depth reports from me. I have
a number of reports that might interest you that are sold at Royal Numerology,
but the first is to get your Free Numerology Report and decide for yourself if 
the personalized forecast I've prepared for you is accurate and relevant.<br><br>

		Now, to give you a better understanding of how you birth name and date of birth are 
used to create your free Numerological Report, please view this <a href="http://royalnumerology.com/sample/" target="_blank">sample report</a> 
of a famous celebrity. The reports I'll be preparing for you in a shortwhile
will be very similar, but yours will be based on what I calculate from your
name and date of birth. Plus, yours will be even more in-depth and eye-opening.<br><br>

		Please rest ensure that I'm the sole owner of the information collected on this 
site. I only have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give me via 
email or other direct contact from you. I will not sell or rent this information to 
anyone. See our full <a href="http://royalnumerology.com/privacy.php" target="_blank">Privacy Policy here</a>.
