Every computer connected to the Internet is given an "Internet Protocol" IP address. When a visitor requests a page from anywhere within the RICC website, our servers automatically recognize that visitor's domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address from which you have accessed our site. We use this information to examine our traffic in aggregate, but do not collect and evaluate this information for individuals. Our servers do not record e-mail addresses of the visitors and the only email addresses collected are those submitted by a visitor upon becoming a member of RICC, which are required for membership, however these are not used for anything other than the normal purposes of being a RICC member, such as our infrequent newsletters, competition results and the likes, no email address would ever be used for any other purpose.

We may also request your e-mail address or mailing address for the purposes of security or to provide additional services (for example, subscriptions to the RICC e-mail newsletter, announcement list or for the directory).
