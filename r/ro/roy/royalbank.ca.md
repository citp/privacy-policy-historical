# RBC Royal Bank - Privacy

### Protecting Your Privacy is Important to Us!

In just a few short years, the Internet has revolutionized the way we do business. It allows us to interact with you personally across time and space to offer information and additional value, to listen to your opinions and to provide a host of banking and financial services that you can access from the convenience of your home or office. At the same time, it also brings legitimate concerns about privacy and security. 

At [RBC](https://web.archive.org/web/20060616200350id_/http%3A//www.rbcroyalbank.com/privacy/companies_gov.html), we are dedicated to protecting your privacy and safeguarding your personal, business, and financial information. In fact, it is one of our highest priorities and remains the cornerstone of our commitment to you. However you choose to provide information to us, we use vigorous security safeguards and adhere to [Ten Privacy Principles](https://web.archive.org/web/20060616200350id_/http%3A//www.rbcroyalbank.com/privacy/priv_pri.html) to ensure your personal and financial information is protected. 

You are invited to use this privacy site to learn more about current legislation designed to protect your privacy, about the types of information we collect and how it is used, and about the steps we have taken to ensure your personal and financial information is handled appropriately.
