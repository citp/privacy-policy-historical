Exactly who sees your information depends on the context in which you provided it and the purpose for which it is being used (please see the section above headed “Why we collect information about you”).

Sometimes we'll share your information with carefully selected third parties outside the Royal Mail group. We may do this for the following reasons:

    * To provide you with a service. Some of our services are provided in conjunction with our business partners, and we'll need to disclose your information to them to provide you with the services. We make it clear in the terms and conditions for each service whether information will be passed to third parties or not. We may also share your information with certain third parties performing services for us where this will help us to provide services to you, or to improve the quality of the services that we provide to you.
    * To provide you with information about special promotions and offers. If you have given your consent by choosing to opt in on the registration form, we may share some of your information with carefully selected third parties so that they can provide you with information about products and services that may be of interest to you.
    * To protect the Royal Mail group or others. We may share your information with third parties (including the police and other law inforcement agencies) when we believe it is necessary to comply with the law or protect our or another person’s rights, property, or safety. This includes exchanging information with third parties to protect against fraud and to reduce payment risks or disclosure of personal information to the police and other law enforcement authorities in connection with the prevention and detection of crime..
    * In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets and if this happens we may disclose your information to the potential seller or buyer of such business or assets.

We will only deal with third parties that we trust to act in our customers’ best interests and who treat our customers’ information with the same stringent controls that we apply ourselves.

  * ## Where do we store and process your information?

Generally we will store and process your information within the UK. However, the information that we collect about you may be processed in, transferred to, and/or stored at, a destination outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) where privacy laws may not provide the same level of protection as within the EEA.

  * ## How long do we keep your information?

How long we keep your information depends on the context in which you provided it and the purposes for which we use it. We will only retain information for as long as is necessary for such purposes.

In particular:

    * We will keep your information that is necessary for us to provide you with a service you have requested or purchased for as long as it takes us to provide you with that service.
    * We will keep your contact details for marketing purposes for as long as we have your consent for: (i) us to send you marketing information about our products and services by you not opting-out of receiving this marketing information; and/or (ii) third parties to provide you with information about products and services that may be of interest to by you opting-in to receiving this marketing information.

  * ## Important information about opting-in and opting-out

You can allow us to provide you with information about products and services that we, or third parties we have carefully selected, believe will be of interest to you. We will only do this with your consent.

You give us your consent to receive marketing information from us about our products and services we believe will be of interest to you by choosing not to opt-out on your registration form.

You give us your consent to receiving marketing information from third parties about their products and services by choosing to opt-in on your registration form.

You can change your mind and remove or add your consent at any time through the Edit your profile page. We will endeavour to comply with your request as soon as we are reasonably able to do so. If your information has been passed to third parties with your consent you may need to contact them if you change your mind in relation to their continued use of your information. Please also note that the opt-ins and opt-outs on this website (unless specifically stated otherwise) cover all means of communicating with you, including by email, post, phone, SMS text message and other electronic means.

When you choose to opt-in or opt-out through the website, this opt-in or opt-out will only apply to the information stored about you on this website's databases. If you have provided information to a business in the Royal Mail group through another channel, the use of that information will not be affected by the opt-ins or opt-outs you select on the website.

There are some consents on this website that are specific to individual services and these will be identified to you. These are independent of the registration process and currently cannot be changed through the 'Edit your profile page'. We are actively looking into incorporating these into the ‘Edit your profile page’ mechanism.

  * ## How you can help keep your information secure online

There is a lot that you can do to help keep your information safe - not just on our website, but whenever you provide information online.

Here are some simple ways you can improve the security of your information.

###  Use a strong password

Read our advice on choosing a strong password. This will help you choose a password that will be difficult for other people to guess but easy for you to remember.

###  Use a secure password hint

Do not make your password hint the same as your password! Your password hint should not give away your password to someone you know well, for example 'my road' or 'my dog's name'.

###  Keep your password private and secure

Your password is a key to your personal information and online identity. Don't tell anyone your password or write it down. If you are concerned that somebody else knows your password, you can change it on our website by going to the Edit Your Profile page. We recommend that you change your password from time to time.

###  Use a secure browser

Modern browsers are more secure than older versions, so always keep your browser up to date. If you browse with Internet Explorer, set Windows to update itself automatically to keep your private data safe.
