    GETTY IMAGES PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
<p class="Normal Black">
    Last updated: May 2012</p>
<p class="Normal Black">
    Getty Images is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy tells
    you about our online collection and use of data. The terms of this policy apply
    to all Getty Images websites, unless different terms are specified in a form or
    contract provided to you online or offline.</p>
<p class="Normal Black">
    By using this site, you understand and agree to the terms of this policy. This site
    is owned by Getty Images and may be accessed in the United States and abroad. For
    data protection purposes, Getty Images is the controller and, unless otherwise noted,
    is also the processor of data. Information collected may be retained, and may be
    stored, processed, accessed, and used in jurisdictions whose privacy laws may be
    different and less protective than those of your home jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Subtitle Grey">
    Collection of Your Personal Information</p>
<p class="Normal Grey">
    Getty Images collects certain kinds of information, such as the website that referred
    you to us, your IP address, browser type and language, and access times. We also
    may collect navigational information, including information about the pages you
    view, the links you click, and other actions taken in connection with the site.</p>
<p class="Normal Grey">
    We may combine your visit and navigational information with personal information
    that you provide. You may always choose not to provide personal information, but
    if you so choose, certain products and services may not be available to you. Personal
    information (e.g., your username and password, your name, your mailing address,
    email address, and phone number) is collected when you register. Additional personal
    information (e.g., your credit card number and billing address) is collected to
    process transactions or to provide you with products and services.</p>
<p class="Normal Grey">
    Limited demographic information, such as industry you work in, is sometimes collected
    and may be linked to your personal information.</p>
<p class="Subtitle Grey">
    Use of Your Personal Information</p>
<p class="Normal Grey">
    Getty Images collects and uses your personal information to operate and improve
    our sites, to process your transactions, to provide customer service, to perform
    research and analysis aimed at improving our products, services and technologies,
    and to display content that is customized to your interests and preferences.
</p>
<p class="Normal Grey">
    We also use your personal information to communicate with you. We may send transaction-related
    communications such as welcome letters, billing reminders, and purchase confirmations.
    We may also send you surveys or marketing communications to inform you of new products
    or services or other information that may be of interest. If you do not wish to
    receive marketing emails, you may adjust your “Personal Information Preferences”
    as described below or follow the “unsubscribe” instructions included within each
    email communication.</p>
<p class="Normal Grey">
    Personal information collected by Getty Images may be stored and processed in the
    United States or any other country in which Getty Images or its affiliates, subsidiaries,
    contractors or agents maintain facilities, and by using our sites or services, you
    consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. Getty Images
    abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce
    regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union. If
    you would like to exercise any of your data protection rights (including the right
    to have your personal information deleted), please contact us using the “Contact
    Information” below.</p>
<p class="Subtitle Grey">
    Sharing of Your Personal Information</p>
<p class="Normal Grey">
    Except as disclosed in this privacy policy, Getty Images does not share your personal
    information with any outside parties.
</p>
<p class="Normal Grey">
    We may share your personal information within our corporate group, including with
    our subsidiaries and divisions, all of whom may use your information for the purposes
    disclosed herein.</p>
<p class="Normal Grey">
    We may share your personal information with service providers who perform services
    on our behalf. For example, we may hire other companies to handle the processing
    of payments, to provide data storage, to host websites, to fulfill orders and shipments,
    to assist in direct marketing, to conduct audits, etc. Those companies will be permitted
    to obtain only the personal information they need to provide the service. They are
    required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from
    using it for any other purpose.</p>
<p class="Normal Grey">
    Information about our customers, including personal information, may be disclosed
    as part of any merger, acquisition, or sale of the company and/or its assets, as
    well as in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, in which
    personal information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the company.
    We will notify you of such an occurrence as described in the “Changes to This Privacy
    Policy” section below.</p>
<p class="Normal Grey">
    We reserve the right to disclose your personal information if required to do so
    by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is reasonably necessary to
    comply with legal process, respond to claims, or protect the rights, property or
    safety of our company, employees, customers, or the public.</p>
<p class="Normal Grey">
    If you license copyrighted photographs of the National Basketball Association, Women’s
    National Basketball Association, National Basketball Development league or any of
    their respective affiliates (collectively, the “NBA Parties”), your personal information
    may be shared with the NBA Parties, their affiliated entities and business partners,
    and used for their commercial activities, including marketing. Please see the “Personal
    Information Preferences” section below for instructions on how you can revoke your
    consent to have your information shared with the NBA Parties.</p>
<p class="Subtitle Black">
    Accessing Your Personal Information</p>
<p class="Normal Black">
    If you would like to review or revise information that you previously provided to
    us, you may access your information in the “My Account” section of the website.
    Your Account Executive can also assist you in making any changes, as well as in
    exercising your right to have your personal information deleted. If you need additional
    assistance, please contact us at <a class="inline" href="mailto:sales@gettyimages.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy">
        sales@gettyimages.com</a>. You can expect a response from us within 10 calendar
    days. Please be advised that you cannot change your username without re-registering.
</p>
<p class="Subtitle Grey">
    Personal Information Preferences</p>
<p class="Normal Grey">
    Getty Images respects your right to make choices about the use and disclosure of
    your personal information. If at any time you decide that you do not want to receive
    marketing emails from us, please let us know by: (1) checking or unchecking the
    appropriate box on your online registration form or the “My Profile” page of the
    website; (2) contacting your Account Executive; or (3) sending an email to sales@gettyimages.com.</p>
<p class="Normal Grey">
    If you choose not to receive marketing emails, please be advised that you may continue
    to receive transactional or account emails (e.g., purchase confirmations and account
    balance statements).</p>
<p class="Normal Grey">
    If you are a licensee of copyrighted photographs of the NBA Parties and would like
    to revoke your consent to have your information shared with the NBA Parties, you
    may express that preference by contacting your Account Executive or by sending an
    email to sales@gettyimages.com.</p>
<p class="Subtitle Grey">

    This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by Getty Images only, and does not
    cover the use of cookies by third parties. If you would like more information about
    Internet advertising companies, including how to opt-out of their information collection,
    please visit www.networkadvertising.org.</p>
<p class="Normal Grey">
    In addition to cookies, we may use other technologies, including single-pixel gifs
    (also known as web beacons) on our websites and in promotional e-mail messages or

    have visited certain pages or opened messages or newsletters. We do not use these
    single-pixel gifs to collect personal information.</p>
<p class="Normal Grey">
    You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most browsers automatically accept
    cookies, but you can modify your browser setting to decline cookies. Please be aware
    that the site is optimally designed to operate with cookies enabled in your internet

    may negatively impact your experience of the site.</p>
<p class="Subtitle Grey">
    Security of Your Personal Information</p>
<p class="Normal Grey">
    The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally
    accepted industry standards to help protect your personal information. For instance,
    when you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our registration
    or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer (SSL) technology.
    No method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is
    100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your personal information, we
    cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<p class="Normal Grey">
    If a password is used to protect your account and personal information, it is your
    responsibility to keep your password confidential.</p>
<p class="Subtitle Black">
    Forums &amp; Other Interactive Services</p>
<p class="Normal Black">
    Our websites may include discussion forums or other interactive areas or services,
    including blogs, chat rooms, bulletin boards, message boards, online hosting or
    storage services, or other areas or services in which you or third parties create,
    post or store any content, messages, comments, materials or other items on the sites
    (“Interactive Areas”). If you use an Interactive Area, you should be aware that
    these areas are open to the public and any personal information you post or provide
    at registration may be viewable by others. We are not responsible for personal information
    you submit in connection with the Interactive Areas, nor are we responsible for
    how others might use that information, including to send you unsolicited messages.
    Interactive Area postings may be retained indefinitely. If at any time you would
    like to remove a posting, please email us at sales@gettyimages.com. Keep in mind
    that removal of a posting from an Interactive Area does not mean that the posting
    will be deleted from our systems.</p>
<p class="Subtitle Black">
    Email Referrals</p>
<p class="Normal Black">
    If you choose to use our email referral services to tell a friend about our products
    or services (including images in your Lightbox, promotional campaigns, new websites,
    job postings, etc.), we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We
    will use that information to send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her
    to visit the site and review the product or service you have selected. We may use
    a third-party provider to administer this function, but any such third party provider
    may only use the information submitted to facilitate this one-time email. Neither
    Getty Images nor any third-party provider stores this information after the email
    is sent.</p>
<p class="Subtitle Black">
    Children</p>
<p class="Normal Black">
    We do not intend to solicit or collect personal information from anyone under the
    age of 18. If you are under 18, you should not use or enter information on this
    site, including without limitation, any Interactive Areas of the site.</p>
<p class="Subtitle Black">
    Links</p>

    We may link to websites, including those of our third-party content providers, that
    have different privacy policies and practices from those disclosed here. We assume
    no responsibility for the policies or practices of such linked sites, and encourage
    you to become acquainted with them prior to use.</p>
