When you access Royole servers, our servers will automatically record certain types of log data. This server log data can include the following information: IP address, browser type, browser language, referral source page, operating system, date/time marker, and click stream data. When you experience an abnormal system exit or crash, we will collect information about your device's current environment to help you diagnose the problem.

We may collect your browser-type, operating system and other software or hardware information. In terms of information related to server-end records, when you use products such as the browser, Royole will collect information related to your server-end records, such as the data related to user actions such as uploading, downloading, syncing, and browsing.

We may collect information about searches and queries you perform, other users you interact with, subjects that you are studying and other related information.

We may link or combine your Personal Information with other information we get about your use of other services and from third parties to help understand you and your needs, and provide you with recommendations, better service and customized marketing.

We may use internal tools and third party applications and services (such as Google Analytics) to collect and analyze information. Please see Section 4 of this Privacy Policy for additional information on Google Analytics. 

We may use "cookies" or similar technologies to enhance your experience and gather information about visitors and visits to our Site. Please refer to the "Do we use 'cookies'?" section below for information about cookies and how we use them.

We will also collect any information that you provide to us if you correspond with us or post any Content through the Services.

ii.Use of automatically collected information

The non-personably identifiable information that we collect in terms of language, postal code, and phone number can help us better understand user behavior and help us improve our products, services, and advertising.

We can use the statistical data we get through analysis of your activities on our Site or Services to continuously improve the operating experience and operational performance of our products and services and to fix problems and improve functional design.

The information that we collect through the use of cookies and other technologies (such as pixel tags) will be used to provide a better user experience and to raise our overall service quality. For example, by saving your language settings, we can provide you with service in your preferred language. We can use pixel tags to make sure emails are sent to users in a readable format and to tell us whether or not the email we sent has been opened. We can use this information to be able to send fewer emails to users or to not send email to users at all.

## 2\. General Use of Information

In addition to the uses described in Section 1 of this Privacy Policy, we may use any information we collect from you in the following ways: 

●To personalize the Services and to allow us to deliver the type of content and product offerings that most interest you.

You can update your own personal data or ask us to delete your personal account unless there is a requirement to save this data due to legal reasons. When updating your personal data, we may require you to first verify your identity before processing your request.

We may refuse certain requests that are tediously repetitive, that require too many technical resources, that threaten the privacy of others, or that are very impractical.

We will provide this service to you free-of-charge as long as allowing you to access and revise the data does not occupy too many of our resources. We strive to improve and maintain our services to protect data from being accidentally or maliciously destroyed. Therefore, after you delete data from our server, we may not be able to immediately delete this data or its remaining copies from the server it is being used on, and we may not be able to delete the corresponding data from our backup systems.

## 4\. Information sharing

Except where clearly stipulated elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we generally do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personal Information unless we provide you with advance notice. The term "outside parties" does not include our affiliates and any other parties who assist us in offering Services, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. 

You hereby authorize us to share your Personal Information with third parties without asking for your consent in the following situations:

●In the situation where it is required by law, legal proceedings, lawsuit, or the public and government authorities, we may share your Personal Information with the designated third parties.

●If we are involved in business transactions such as reorganization, merger, or sale, we may disclose your Personal Information to the transacting party for the purposes of the business transaction.

## 5\. Data security

Royole follows generally accepted industry security standards to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security and correctly use your Personal Information.
