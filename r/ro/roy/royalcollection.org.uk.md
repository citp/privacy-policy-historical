 **Cookies explained**

  * What is a cookie?



Cookies are small text files that are sent by websites that you visit to recognise who you are when you return there. There files are stored on your computer’s hard drive, and are read by your web browser.

  * How are cookies used?



Cookies perform several functions, such as remembering who you are on a particular site (your welcome message), to keeping you logged in to your account screen on an ecommerce site (however, you should always log out if you are using a public computer). Advertising agencies also use cookies to find out if they have served you an advert from a particular brand on a site, or if you have seen a particular advert before. Website owners will use cookies to follow which pages that you’ve read so that they can see what parts of the site are popular or not. In short, cookies are a way of providing statistics on site visits as well as some limited functionality that makes your site visit easier. When used properly cookies are an asset to a site visitor and a site owner. They are not viruses, but some unscrupulous outfits will use them maliciously – we follow best practice for cookie use.

A list of all the cookies used on this website by us and our technology partners can be found in our Cookies page.

  * Flash cookies



Adobe uses a particular type of cookie called a ‘Local Shared Object’, which is typically collected if you watch a video for example that uses the Adobe Flash media player, i.e. an embedded YouTube video on a page that is being played via Flash. Please note that these types of cookie will not be found on iPads, which do not support Flash. Have a look at Adobe's website if you want to control Flash cookies on your computer. If you’ve got a Firefox browser you can also get an add-on to detect and delete Flash cookies.

  * What is a web beacon?



Web beacons, sometimes referred to as ‘web bugs’, are small single-pixel transparent image files. They allow website owners to know when a visitor has reached their website and are used in conjunction with cookies to allow further website tracking. These files are not viruses and are useful in helping us to make your web-surfing experience better.

 **Opting out of cookies**

There are a number of options available so that you do not have to store any cookies at all. You can either set your browser so that it will not accept and store any cookie, or, if you have a little more time and knowledge, you can allow only certain ‘trusted’ sites to store cookies on your computer.

It’s worth bearing in mind that if you decide to delete all your cookies, then you will probably have to re-enter all your usernames and passwords on all the sites that you visit, which you previously didn’t have to do. Cookies can be a real asset to your web-surfing experience.

The Information Commissioner’s Office (<http://www.ico.gov.uk/>) provides some advice about cookies and their use, and a link to ‘About cookies’ (

[ _www.aboutcookies.org_](http://www.aboutcookies.org/)

), which is run by the law firm Pinsent Masons. This website provides more information about cookies and shows you how to allow those trusted sites to store their cookies on your computer.
