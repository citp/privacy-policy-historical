We regularly review and update them to ensure that the protection we provide you with is always completely up to date. 

Only reputable electronic cash merchants are used for all your transactions and your account number and password are required to authorize these. This provides an extra layer of security verification in that it is not possible to make a transaction on your behalf without your unique details.
