When you register at our casino, we request specific information from you, including contact information (your name and e-mail address etc), unique identifiers (like your social security number) and financial information (like your account or credit card numbers).

We use customer contact information from the registration form to send you information about our online casino. Financial information that is collected is necessary for registration as a Real Player.

No information will be sold, given or in any way transmitted to any person, corporation or other entity outside Roxy Palace Online Casino and associated companies.

###  Security

All Roxy Palace Casino sites have strict security measures implemented to protect against unauthorized use, loss and/or alteration of the information under our control. 

Credit card or any other financial transaction or information dissemination cannot take place without prior authorization by way of entering usernames and passwords. Our e-commerce partners, Proc-Cyber-Services (PCS) and NCrypt Solutions (London, UK), an affiliate of RoxyPalace.com, require specific details to be supplied and confirmed before any financial transactions are processed. PCS also employs a Fraud Prevention department, which ensures the security and integrity of customers' details. 

Records of all transactions are also strictly maintained by us. This enables us to access all data should the need to do so arise. 128-Bit encryption is used at all times when transferring any data via the Internet. Each customer is issued with a unique account number and can choose their own password, which cannot be accessed by staff or agents of Roxy Palace Online Casino.

If you require further information or have any questions, please refer to our site for Help and Contact details for our casino support.
