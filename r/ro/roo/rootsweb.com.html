<b>Privacy Information for RootsWeb.com</b></p>
<p>RootsWeb.com Statement of Privacy: MyFamily.com, Inc., owner and operator of RootsWeb.com, recognizes 
the confidentiality of information that may be disclosed by members in registering or making purchases 
from our website and we are firmly committed to protecting your privacy. The following discloses our information 
gathering and dissemination practices for this site. </p>
<p> <b>Overview:</b><br>
The personal, private information that is provided to RootsWeb.com by individual members is not provided 
to unrelated third parties except in rare cases involving possible violations of our use policies or legal 
statutes. We do collect some data, always with your knowledge and consent, that is used to fulfill orders 
and otherwise enhance content to better meet the needs of our users.</p>
<p>Information submitted by you online (such as products you purchase from a MyFamily.com, Inc network 
site, your name, address, e-mail address) may be shared with companies with which RootsWeb.com has a commerce 
relationship and through which you reached this site, for marketing purposes. In such circumstances you 
will be considered their customer as well. If you object to such use, you may opt-out by e-mail request. 
Under no circumstances will RootsWeb.com share with any other party your password or other personal information 
it may acquire about children, family, etc.</p>
<p>Demographic information collected through on-site user surveys may be used in aggregate statistical 
form to attract potential sponsors.</p>
<p>The specifics of our Privacy Policy are best described in the answers to the following Frequently Asked 
Questions:</p>
<p><b>Does RootsWeb.com ask for personal information?</b><br>
In some cases, personal information is required to use RootsWeb.com features. In these cases, RootsWeb.com 
asks for your name, e-mail address, and other limited personal information when you register and use features 
such as the message boards, and make purchases at the Ancestry.com online store. Most of this information 
may be entered at your discretion. We may ask for similar information at other times, such as when you 
enter sweepstakes or other promotions sponsored by RootsWeb.com and/or our many partners.</p>
<p><b>How Does RootsWeb.com use my personal information?</b><br>
Our goal is to provide you with the most personalized, relevant, user-friendly Web experience possible. 
The primary use of all your personal information is to efficiently provide you with relevant information.</p>
<p>RootsWeb.com will also use registration information to let you know about new features or other offers 
of interest from RootsWeb.com, or to address customer service needs and requests. </p>
<p>In distributing advertiser or sponsor messages, the advertiser never has access to individual account 
information. RootsWeb.com does not sell, rent, or otherwise distribute the personal information you provide 
us to these advertisers. Advertisers simply provide an insertion order for the advertising message and 
RootsWeb.com then displays the ad to appropriate users based on the criteria specified in the order.</p>
<p><b>Will RootsWeb.com disclose any of my personal information to third parties?</b><br>
RootsWeb.com will not disclose any of your personal information, except with your knowledge and consent 
as described in this policy or as may be required by law, or to protect the rights or property of RootsWeb.com.</p>
<p>Circumstances where limited personal information may be disclosed are specifically described when the 
data is collected, such as in the User Agreement, or in the rules of sweepstakes or other promotions. 
So in all cases you control what, if any, information you disclose.</p>
<p>RootsWeb.com reserves the right to disclose aggregated user statistics, such as "45% of our users 
are female" or "47% of our users have attended college" in order to describe our services 
to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties. Under protection of confidentiality agreements, 
RootsWeb.com may match common user information, such as name, address, and phone number, with third party 
data to avoid duplication and prevent errors.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you click away from RootsWeb.com to visit the site of any third party advertiser or 
sponsor, you may be asked for your credit card or other personal information in order to purchase or use 
products and services offered. These companies have their own privacy and data collection practices. RootsWeb.com 
has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. You should therefore review their privacy 
policies carefully if you have concerns about how your information may be used.</p>
<p><b>Will RootsWeb.com use my information for direct mailings?</b><br>
RootsWeb will send electronic mail to you, for the purpose of informing you of changes or additions to 
RootsWeb, or of any Rootsweb related products and services. If you do not want to receive such mailings, 
you may opt out at any time by using the unsubscribe link listed in the e-mail. </p>
<p><b>May I refuse to provide personal information to RootsWeb.com or to accept advertising?</b><br>
Visitors may access RootsWeb.com services without providing any personal information. To gain full access 
to certain features, a username, e-mail address and appropriate personal information are required. Because 
the RootsWeb.com website is partially advertiser supported, you may not "turn off" the advertising 
that appears on RootsWeb.com pages, but you may opt to be excluded from any e-mail advertising.</p>
<p><b>Does RootsWeb.com use "IP Addresses" and cookies?</b></p>
<p><b>IP Addresses:</b><br>
We do use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our website. Your 
IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information such as geographic distribution of our 
members.</p>
<p><b>RootsWeb.com Cookies:</b><br>
Contrary to popular myth, cookies do not extract private or personal information from your computer's 
memory, but rather, record only information you volunteer to us upon registering or visiting the site. 
Cookies are tiny files placed onto the hard drive of your computer when you register at our Web site that 
enable our server to recognize or "remember" who you are each time you return. RootsWeb.com 
may make limited use of cookies to deliver content specific to your interests. For instance they may be 
used to retain your personal preferences, hold session information for a "shopping basket," 
or save your password so it doesn't have to be re-entered each time you login.</p>
<p><b>Advertiser Cookies:</b><br>
RootsWeb.com does post third party advertising banners on general use pages. These ads may contain cookies 
used primarily to provide data to the advertiser about where visitors are coming from. While we do use 
cookies in other parts of our website as explained above, cookies received with banner ads may or may 
not be collected by our company or be under our control.</p>
<p><b>What else should I know about privacy?</b><br>
The following encapsulates a few key issues mentioned in context above. </p>
<p><b>Member Profiles</b><br>
Demographic data is collected at our site at the users' option. This information may include age and gender 
and other personal preferences that can be viewed and tabulated for use in marketing RootsWeb.com to advertisers 
and others. In no case is personal information given or sold to third parties. RootsWeb.com controls the 
distribution of ALL information at the site.</p>
<p><b>Contests &amp; Promotions</b><br>
RootsWeb.com may occasionally run contests or other special promotions on our site in which we ask members 
or visitors for contact information (like an e-mail address) or demographic information (like a zip code, 
age, or income level). We use this data to send users promotional material about our company or our partners. 
The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary and may be shared 
with other companies for promotional purposes, but only with your prior permission and under the terms 
and conditions specified when you take part in the promotion. At any time, users may opt-out of receiving 
future mailings of this kind, or simply decline to take part in the promotions.</p>
<p><b>Policy on the Living</b><br>
MyFamily.com, Inc. (MyFamily.com, Ancestry.com, RootsWeb.com, and its other holdings) websites include 
records containing information on the deceased, as well as information for the purpose of locating and 
contacting living individuals. We reserve the right to remove any content, including, but not limited 
to, information on the living for the purpose of protecting the security and privacy of living individuals. 
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p><b>Removal of Information Owned by MyFamily.com, Inc:</b> If you locate your personal information in 
records provided by MyFamily.com, Inc. it is the policy of MyFamily.com, Inc. that removal of these records 
will occur 30 days from the receipt of a legitimate written request. In some cases, such as phone and 
address listings, it will be necessary for you to contact the original source to request the removal of 
that information. Living individuals may request records removed only for their own selves. Parents may 
also request records removal for any living minor children. Guardians may request records removal for 
living wards.</p>
<p><b>Removal of Information Posted by Users:</b> Should you discover your personal information is located 
within material uploaded by a MyFamily.com, Inc. customer, please note that MyFamily.com, Inc. does not 
own material submitted by its customers. Any records removal requests within user-submitted data should 
be directed to the submitters of that data. In cases where the author is unavailable or does not return 
contact within 30 days, MyFamily.com, Inc. may undertake removals or redactions according to company policy. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Policy on the Deceased</b> <br>
MyFamily.com, Inc. follows the general state of the law, which is that there is no right of privacy for 
deceased individuals, and as a company dedicated to helping people do genealogical and family history 
research, information about the deceased is vital to the company mission and the core benefit to our customers. 
MyFamily.com, Inc. considers record removal requests for living individuals only.</p>
