## Privacy Policy

Protecting your privacy is critical to Roomster. We will not sell, lease or exchange your personal data to third parties without first obtaining your express consent. 

This privacy policy describes how we collect and use your data. If you have any questions or comments regarding Roomster's privacy policy or its enforcement, please contact us at [privacy@roomster.com](mailto:privacy@roomster.com)

  


  1. ABOUT ROOMSTER. Roomster is an online apartment, roommate and subletting community that connects people with apartments with help from their friends. Members create their own profiles, and those profiles are then shown to their network of friends.
  2. INFORMATION WE COLLECT. Roomster collects information our users submit to us such as their name and e-mail address to allow us to identify users and notify them of changes or updates to our service. We also collect personal information submitted by our users in filling out their profile on the service such as gender, state of residence, occupation, interests, etc. We collect this personal information when our users: (a) sign up as a member; (b) make changes to their member profile information; and (c) send e-mail messages, forms, or other information to us via Roomster. Members may choose to provide additional information beyond their basic profile for their personal and professional profiles. Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration is entirely optional, but enables our users to better identify each other and more effectively connect and interact with their network.

Roomster also collects information from users that is unique, but cannot be linked to a specific individual, such as IP address and browser type. A user's session will be tracked, but each user will remain anonymous. We gather this information on all visitors to Roomster.com for systems administration purposes and to track user trends, such as our most popular features. We do not link IP addresses to any personally identifiable information.

  3. COOKIES Like many other Web sites, Roomster uses a standard technology called "cookies." Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive -- not on our site. They can help make the Internet experience quicker and more convenient. Cookies allow our users to login without entering their ID and password each time they use Roomster. Cookies help us understand how members use Roomster, which allows us to improve upon the service. Members who disable cookies will not be able to use Roomster.
  4. HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION. Roomster uses personal information to create a secure and personalized service for our members. The Basic Profile information (first name, photo, age, gender, city, state, and occupation) is displayed to all members of Roomster. All other profile information members provide is displayed only to people registered members.

Email address and full name are used when a user invites a friend via email to join the service, when a user requests to add another user to their friend list, and when we send notifications to a user related to their use of the service. Except when members invite friends, their email address is not shared or displayed with people within or outside of their Personal Network. Users within a Personal Network communicate on Roomster with each other through the Roomster service without disclosing their email addresses.

  5. DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. We will not sell, lease or exchange your personal data to third parties without first obtaining your express consent, unless required by law or to protect your membership.
  6. INVITING FRIENDS. If you use our Invite feature to invite a friend to our service, we will ask you for their friend's email address. We'll automatically send the friend an email inviting them to join your Personal Network. Roomster does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any communication other than the invitation to join your Personal Network. Roomster stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our Invite functionality. The friend receiving the invitation may contact Roomster at [help@roomster.com](mailto:help@roomster.com) to request the removal of this information from our database.
  7. LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES. The Roomster site may contain links to other Web sites. Please be aware that Roomster is not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites our users choose to visit. If our users provide any information directly to parties other than Roomster (even if those sites are showing the Roomster brand), different rules may apply to the use or disclosure of the personal information disclosed. We encourage you to investigate and ask questions before disclosing your personal information to third parties.
  8. THIRD PARTY ADVERTISERS. Roomster may choose to deploy advertising on the service that is delivered to users through a third party's advertising server. Information about users' visit to Roomster, such as number of times they have viewed an ad (but no personally identifiable information), would be used to serve ads to users on this site.
  9. CHAT ROOMS, MESSAGE BOARDS, AND PUBLIC FORUMS. Please be aware that whenever members voluntarily disclose personal information online - e.g., message boards, chat areas, file uploads, events, and listings - that information becomes public and can be collected and used by others. By posting personal information online in public forums, members may receive unsolicited messages from other parties.
  10. PRIVACY PROTECTION FOR CHILDREN. In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we will not knowingly provide access to Roomster to persons under the age of thirteen (13). If Roomster later learns that any member is under the age of thirteen (13), we will take appropriate steps to remove the member's information from the database and we will restrict this individual from future access to the Roomster service.
  11. UPDATING AND DELETING PERSONAL INFORMATION. Members can access, change and update their registration and personal information by logging onto Roomster and selecting the Edit Profile option. Users who leave the service may choose to have their personal information deleted by contacting help@roomster.com
  12. OPT-OUT OF EMAIL. Users of Roomster may choose not to receive email notifications at their registered email addresses. To opt out of the announcements, click the Account link at the top of any page, and uncheck the box next to "Send email notifications."
  13. SECURITY PROCEDURES. Roomster has implemented security measures to protect member information from loss, misuse and alteration. We use industry-standard practices such as encrypted storage, firewalls and password protection systems to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information. Each of our employees is aware of our security policies, and your information is only available to those employees who need it to perform their jobs.
  14. CONSENT. This Privacy Policy is a part of the Roomster Terms of Use policy. By using Roomster, including services available at the Roomster and Roomster domains, users are using a service provided by Roomster and they agree to be bound by the Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy. Some terms may be defined in the Terms of Use. This Privacy Policy only addresses activities from our servers.
  15. NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES. If Roomster changes its policy and seeks to use your personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, you will be notified via email. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post the notice, we will also email users who have opted to receive communications from us to notify them of the changes in our privacy practices.
  16. ORGANIZATION COLLECTING INFORMATION. Roomster Corp. owns and operates the Roomster.com domain. You may contact Roomster at [privacy@roomster.com](mailto:privacy@roomster.com)
