Room 77 sets and accesses cookies on your computer. A cookie is a small amount of data that Room 77's servers transfer to your browser and that only Room 77's servers can read. When you visit the site, the cookie captures specific session data to streamline your experience and, if you select to save your member name and password, Room 77 will save this information in a cookie so that you will not be required to sign in each time you visit the site. You may disable or delete cookies from within your Internet browser application by accessing the security or privacy settings. However, Room 77 requires you to have cookies enabled to access certain portions of the site.

We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe have a legitimate need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. Room 77 employs procedural and technical measures reasonably designed to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure. Although we make good faith efforts to store the information collected in a secure operating environment that is not accessible to the public, we cannot guarantee complete security.
