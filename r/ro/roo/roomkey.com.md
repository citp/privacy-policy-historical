# Privacy Statement - Roomkey

## Roomkey's Privacy and Cookie Policy

#### Updated as of August, 2019

At Hotel JV Services, LLC (“Roomkey” or the “Company”) our goal is to deliver you a positive hotel shopping experience. We collect, store, and use certain data about you to facilitate that goal.

This Privacy Policy describes the personal data we may collect about you, how we may use and disclose that data, and the choices you can make about how we collect and use your data.

By visiting and using this website, you agree to our collection, processing, and transfer of your personal data as described in this Privacy Policy. Please do not use our Website if you disagree with any part of this Privacy Policy.

### Information We Collect About You

When you visit our website, we collect your IP address, your browser type, your operating system, and the length of time and the pages you accessed on our website. Roomkey may also collect information relating to the hotels you reviewed on our site and what advertising you may have seen. Roomkey may also know what website you visited before or after you exit from our website. 

We may directly collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools and services, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser, including the pages you visit and other information that assists us in improving the performance of our website. We collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual user.

If you sign up for marketing emails and/or establish a Roomkey account, we collect your email address and password. 

### What We Do With The Information We Collect

The information we collect about you is used for improving our website, improving your shopping experience, and for marketing purposes. That said, we make sure to limit how much information we do request about you.

We carefully manage your email address, and will never send you emails you have not signed up for. You can unsubscribe from our emails by using a link in every marketing email we send, or by sending a note to [feedback@roomkey.com](mailto:feedback@roomkey.com)

From time to time, we may send you marketing emails or advertising that is based on your interests based on how you have used our site. We may use other companies to help us with this—to do that, we share your data with them, and they may also use items like cookies to gather their own information about you.

We do not process financial transactions on our site. Accordingly, we will not ask for credit card information and similar personal identifiable information.
