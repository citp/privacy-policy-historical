We may also use "cookies" and "action tags" to collect information. Cookies and action tags allow us to compile statistics and other information about how you use our sites.

We may also share non-personally identifiable data with third parties on an aggregate basis. 

_Personally identifiable information_ such as your name, home address and e-mail address may be required if you wish to communicate with us via e-mail. This "contact information" may be used to respond to your e-mail or contact you regarding a related matter. Our sites also give you the option to create a "wish list" of your favorite products. To create a wish list, you may be required to provide contact information and select a user name and password. This information may be used to provide you with personal services such as product order history, scheduled delivery information and other relevant notices not available to users who choose not to create a wish list. Submitting contact information and creating a wish list are strictly voluntary and are not required to use our sites.

**Sharing your information**

We reserve the right to provide personally identifiable information as required by law or legal process to protect and defend the rights of Room & Board, Inc., our sites and users of our sites; or in the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event. In such cases, the disclosure of information will be as necessary to protect the personal safety of users of our sites or the public.

**Links to third party web sites**  
Our sites may contain links to other Internet web sites that we think you may find of interest. Room & Board, Inc. is not responsible for the content of these sites, nor do we control, sponsor, endorse or approve them.

The security of your personally identifiable information is important to us. We store your information on a secured server that is not accessible through the Internet.
