### Collection of your Personal Information  
  
Rocket Lawyer Incorporated ("RLI") may collect personally identifiable information, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address or telephone number. RLI may also collect anonymous demographic information, which is not unique to you, such as your Postal Code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites. 

Information about your computer hardware and software also may be automatically collected by RocketLawyer.com. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used by RLI for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the RocketLawyer.com website. 

Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through RocketLawyer.com public message boards, this information may be collected and used by others. 

RLI encourages you to review the privacy statements of websites you choose to link to from RocketLawyer.com so that you can understand how those websites collect, use and share your information. RLI is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on websites outside of the RocketLawyer.com and RLI family of websites.  
  
   
  
### Use of your Personal Information   
  
RLI collects and uses your personal information to operate the RocketLawyer.com website and deliver the services you have requested. RLI will send one welcome email following registration to all registered patrons.  We will also periodically send service updates to registered users. 

RLI may also use your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from RLI and its affiliates. RLI may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered. 

RLI does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. RLI may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. In addition, RLI may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to RocketLawyer.com, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information. 

RLI does not use or disclose sensitive personal information, such as race, religion, or political affiliations, without your explicit consent. 

RLI keeps track of the websites and pages our customers visit within RocketLawyer.com, in order to determine what RocketLawyer.com services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within RocketLawyer.com to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area. 

RLI websites will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on RocketLawyer.com or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of RLI; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of RocketLawyer.com, or the public.  
  
   
  
### Use of Cookies  
  
The RocketLawyer.com website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. 

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize RocketLawyer.com pages, or register with RocketLawyer.com site or services, a cookie helps RocketLawyer.com to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same RocketLawyer.com website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the RocketLawyer.com features that you customized. 

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the RLI services or websites you visit.   
  
   
  
### Security of your Personal Information

RocketLawyer.com secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.   
   
  
### Changes to this Statement  
  
RLI will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect company and customer feedback. RLI encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how RLI is protecting your information.
