<h3>When RockYou Discloses Information</h3>
<p>RockYou will not share, sell, rent or trade your personal information other than as described in this privacy policy.</p>
<p>We provide personally identifiable information and non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf, including credit card processing. We require that our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons agree to process such information in compliance with our Privacy Policy and we use reasonable efforts, including confidentiality and security measures, to limit their use of such information only as necessary to provide these services to us.</p>
<p>We use a third party payment gateway. If you choose to make a purchase within one of our applications, you will be transferred to a third party payment gateway to make the payment. The third party then provides RockYou the name on the account and the amount paid so that we may complete the transaction.</p>
<p>We do share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the RockYou Site. RockYou may share personally-identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information with third party-affiliates and business partners for the purpose of offering greater functionality and enhanced services through RockYou or other sites, and for the purpose of communicating these services to you.</p>
<p>We may release personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law) or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant.</p>
<p>It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities, including but not limited to, fraud, potential threats to public safety or the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use, or as otherwise permitted by law.</p>
<p>RockYou also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information and/or non-personally identifiable information that RockYou believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our the RockYou Sites, and to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of RockYou, our Users or others.</p>

Please note that media files uploaded by Users to the RockYou Sites cannot be removed and remain subject to our Terms of Use.</p>
<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

<h2>Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites</h2>
<p>RockYou allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the RockYou Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the RockYou Sites. These third-parties automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content.</p>
<p>RockYou does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks RockYou to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the target audience.</p>
<p>You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking Here. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.</p>
<p>The RockYou Sites includes links to other web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of RockYou. If you submit personally identifiable information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any web site you visit.</p>
<h2>Social Media Widgets</h2>
<p>The RockYou Sites includes social media features, such as the Facebook Like button and widgets, such as the Share This button or interactive mini-programs that run on our sites. These features may collect your IP address and which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the RockYou Sites. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>
<h2>Our Commitment To Data Security</h2>
<p>RockYou uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to RockYou and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, RockYou makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>
<p>If RockYou learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective measures. RockYou may post a notice on the RockYou Sites if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us by using the contact Information in this statement.</p>
<h2>Our Commitment To Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important to RockYou. For that reason, RockYou does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information or non-personally-identifiable information on the RockYou Sites from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of our website is directed to persons under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access the RockYou Sites at any time or in any manner. If RockYou learns that personally identifiable information of persons under 13 years of age has been collected on the RockYou Sites then RockYou will take the appropriate steps to delete this information immediately.</p>
<p>We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents or guardians for permission before sending any personal information to anyone over the Internet.</p>
<h2>International Users</h2>
<p>The RockYou Sites are hosted in the United States and are intended for and directed to Users in the United States. If you are a User accessing the RockYou Sites from the European Union, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure, that differ from the laws of the United States, please be advised that through your continued use of the RockYou Sites, which are governed by U.S. law, this Privacy Policy, and our Terms of Use, you are transferring your personal information to the United States and you consent to that transfer.</p>
<h2>Access to and Managing Your Personal Information</h2>

If you have provided us with personally identifiable information, you can contact us to request that we provide you with the personally identifiable information we have in our records about you.

<h3>California Users</h3>
<p>We do not share personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure, typically by “opting in” to receive information from a third party that is participating in a sweepstakes or other promotion on one of the RockYou Sites. If you do ask us to share your personal information with a third party for its marketing purposes, we will only share information in connection with that specific promotion, as we do not share information with any third party (other than our service providers) on a continual basis. To prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt in to such use when you provide personal information on one of our sites.</p>

<p>In the event that RockYou undergoes a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, we may transfer all of your information, including personal information, to the successor organization in such a transition in which case, you will be notified via a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personally identifiable information. If we sell a game that is played on Facebook we will put a prominent notice on that page of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personally identifiable information. &nbsp;In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors’ rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used.</p>
<h2>Changes and Updates to This Privacy Policy</h2>
