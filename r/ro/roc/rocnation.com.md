This may include Personal Information that you provide to us, such as your name, email address, postal address, telephone number, gender and any payment details that you may provide us with.

_Information we collect about you._ Each time you use the Site, we may automatically collect the following information, which may be considered to be Personal Information when combined with other information about you:

  * **IP Protocol Addresses and Web Logs**. This Site’s web servers automatically collect the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and log files of visitors. Your IP address is an identifying number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This number is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Site, along with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited. This information is collected in an aggregate form only. We use your IP address, and the IP addresses of all users, for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose problems with the Site’s servers, and administering the Site. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many websites.
  * **Cookies**. We may use a technology called a “cookie” to collect information about how you use the Site. When you visit the Site, a cookie will be placed on your computer and when you visit the Site again, the cookie will help the Site recognize your computer’s browser as a previous visitor and that information along with information about other visitors to the Site collected using cookies help provide us with an understanding of how visitors to the Site use the Site (e.g., which pages of the site are most visited and whether a particular user tends to go to certain sections of the Site more than others). We utilize two types of cookies – “session” and “persistent”. A persistent cookie continues to collect information about your visits and behavior on the Site each time you visit the Site. A session cookie expires when you close your browser and does not retain any information about you after it expires. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, you should be able to modify your browser preference to provide you with choices relating to cookies. For example, if you use a standard browser, you should have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may be unable to use certain Site services (e.g., those services that require you to log on to the Site in order to participate).

A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel (1×1), that is ordinarily not visible to Site visitors and may be associated with cookies on the visitors’ hard drives. Pixel Tags allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Site, to deliver branded services, and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted email messages, Pixel Tags can tell the sender whether and when an email has been opened.

In the event you receive an offer from a third party through our Site, but choose not to accept it, your Personal Information will not be shared.

If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal information without the parent or guardian’s consent by, for example, misrepresenting his or her age, that parent or guardian should contact us at _privacy@rocnation.com_.

To the extent that such information is not stored in our databases, we cannot always ensure that these corrections or deletions will reach such other databases in a timely manner.
  5. **Where We Store Your Personal Information   **



To make the Site available to you or to provide any services to you via the Site, we may share your Personal Information within the Roc Nation group of companies. If you are located in the EEA, this may involve transferring your Personal Information outside of the EEA. Many of our external third parties are based outside of the EEA so their processing of your Personal Information will involve a transfer of data outside of the EEA.

Wherever we transfer your Personal Information outside of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring that at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:

  * We will only transfer your Personal Information to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for Personal Information by the European Commission. For further details see here.
  * Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission, which give Personal Information the same protection it has in the EEA. For further details, see here.
  * Where we use providers based in the USA, we may transfer Personal Information to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield, which requires them to provide similar protection to Personal Information shared between the EEA and the USA. For further details, see here.



Please contact us at _privacy@rocnation.com_ if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your Personal Information out of the EEA.

  10. **Security of Your Personal Information.** Roc Nation employs reasonable security measures consistent with standard industry practice, for Personal Information collected through this Site, including physical, electronic and operational measures to maintain security and prevent unauthorized access. In addition, we limit access to your Personal Information to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to use it. They will only process your Personal Information on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. While Roc Nation takes all appropriate steps to safeguard Personal Information under our control, unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or method of storing data can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As such, we cannot guarantee that Personal Information supplied by users will not be accessed on our servers, or intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. We assume no liability for any damages you may suffer as a result of interception, alteration or misuse of information during such transfers. If you have reason to believe that there has been any breach of the security of the Site, please contact us at privacy@rocnation.com.



In the event of a Personal Information breach, we will notify you and any applicable regulator where we are legally required to do so.

If you are located in the EEA, you have a number of rights in relation to how we process your Personal Information. These include:

  * the right access the Personal Information that we may hold about you;
  * the right to rectify any inaccurate Personal Information that we may hold about you;
  * the right to have your Personal Information erased in certain circumstances, for example, where it is no longer necessary for us to process your Personal Information to fulfil our processing purposes; or where you have exercised your right to object to the processing;
  * the right to restrict the processing of your Personal Information where, for example, the information is inaccurate or it is no longer necessary for us to process such information or where you have exercised your right to object to our processing;
  * the right to object to the processing of your Personal Information which may be exercised in certain circumstances, for example, where we are processing your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes, or where your own legitimate interests outweigh ours; and
  * the right to have your Personal Information ported to a new service provider if you no longer wish to use the Site or our services.



You can exercise any of these rights any time by contacting us at privacy@rocnation.com.

_No fee usually required._

You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

_What we may need from you._

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to exercise your rights. This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

_Time limit to respond._

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
