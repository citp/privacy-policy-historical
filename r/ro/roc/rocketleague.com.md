# Privacy Policy | Rocket League® - Official Site

**PSYONIX PRIVACY POLICY**

Psyonix Inc., a California corporation (“ **Psyonix** ”), is committed to maximizing your experience on our websites www.psyonix.com and www.rocketleaguegame.com (“ **Websites** ”) within a trusted environment. This Psyonix Privacy Policy explains how we collect, protect, use and share information gathered about you online through our Websites. We hope this disclosure will help increase your confidence in our Websites to enhance your experience. Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to information submitted and collected online at our Websites. It does not apply to information that you may submit to us offline, or to websites maintained by other companies or organizations to which we may link.

By using Psyonix’s Websites, products and services, you agree that Psyonix collects and processes the personally identifiable information you provide to us online at the Websites. “ **Personally Identifiable Information** ” is information that can be used to uniquely identify you such as your name, email address, demographic information such as age gender and zip code, or credit card number. If you are a resident of the European Union, Personally Identifiable Information means “personal data” within the meaning of Article 2 (a) of the Directive 95/46 of 24 October 1995.

**_(1) What types of information does Psyonix collect and how will it be used?_**

Psyonix will only use your Personally Identifiable Information to provide you with Psyonix products and services, or to communicate with you about such products and services or the Websites. With respect to any content or documents you may choose to upload to Psyonix, we take the privacy and confidentiality of such seriously. We encrypt all intellectual property content and documents, and permanently delete any redacted edits you make. If you choose to make content or a document public, we recommend you redact any and all references to people and addresses, as we can’t protect public data and we are not responsible for any violation of privacy law you may be liable for.

We employ industry standard techniques to protect against unauthorized access of data about you that we store, including Personally Identifiable Information.

We do not sell email addresses. So that we can provide you with the most efficient and enhanced experience, we may request that you register for a personal account accessible through a confidential password and screen name that you select. You may also be given the opportunity to register a player name when accessing one of our video game products. For purposes of registration, we collect Personally Identifiable Information about you. We also may collect your IP address, browser type, domain name, access times and referring website address. This information is collecting during registration or in response to specific requests from you, for things such as signing up for an email newsletter, chat room, or other online information service we may offer, or contacting us. Our Websites contain links through which an online user can email us. We collect Personally Identifiable Information contained in the email for the purpose of responding to a user’s questions and/or comments. From time to time, we may post on our Websites job openings at Psyonix and provide an email address to which interested applicants can submit their resume. Although we can assure you that any Personally Identifiable Information contained in a resume will be used solely for its intended purpose (i.e., to evaluate the applicant’s qualifications), such information is not subject to this privacy policy.

No matter what method we use to collect Personally Identifiable Information and no matter how we use that information, we will only collect the information deemed reasonably necessary to fulfill your online requests and our legitimate business objectives.

**_(2) Psyonix does not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information from persons under the age of 13_**

Our Websites are directed to a general audience, including children. The Children Online Privacy Protect Act does not allow collection of Personally Identifiable Information from persons under 13 years of age and Psyonix will not knowingly do so. If you are under 13 years of age you should not send Personally Identifiable Information about yourself to Psyonix. If Psyonix discovers that a person under the age of 13 has provided Psyonix with Personally Identifiable Information, Psyonix will immediately delete that person’s Personally Identifiable Information from the Websites and preclude that person from further access.

**_(3) What happens if I refuse to provide my Personally Identifiable Information to Psyonix?_**

If you choose not to submit Personally Identifiable Information when requested, you may not be able to access certain areas of our Websites and you may considerably limit the products and services we can provide you. To simply access our Websites, however, you do not need to give us any Personally Identifiable Information.

**_(4) Does Psyonix use cookies or other means to collect information?_**

You will know when Personally Identifiable Information is collected because you will be asked to fill out a form. However, we may collect some Personally Identifiable Information about you by using data collection technology, so that it may not be readily apparent to you that it is being collected. For instance, when you come to our Websites, your IP address is collected so that we know where to send information you are requesting. An IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet. A “cookie” is a small file or record-keeping device that websites often store on a user’s computer. (You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your computer.) We do not use IP addresses or cookies to collect Personally Identifiable Information, such as your name, or to link this information to Personally Identifiable Information already collected about you. This information may be used to make our Websites more interesting and useful to you. Additionally, we may combine this information with Personally Identifiable Information to identify a user in order to enforce compliance with our Terms of Service Agreement, or to protect our products and service, Websites or users to the Websites.

**_(5) With whom does Psyonix share my Personally Identifiable Information?_**

We do not share Personally Identifiable Information you have provided to us without your consent unless:

  * doing so is appropriate to carry out your own request;
  * we believe it is needed to enforce our Terms of Service;
  * we believe we are required to do so by law or to comply with legal process;
  * we believe it is needed to detect, prevent or address fraud, security or technical issues;
  * to protect our property, legal rights, or that of others.



Psyonix is operated from the United States. If you are visiting our Websites from outside the U.S., you agree to any processing of any Personally Identifiable Information you provide us according to this Privacy Policy.

Psyonix may contact you, by email or other means. For example, Psyonix may send you promotional emails relating to Psyonix or other third parties Psyonix feels you would be interested in, or communicate with you about your use of the Psyonix Websites. Psyonix may also use technology to alert us via a confirmation email when you open an email from us. You can modify your email notification preferences by clicking the appropriate link included in the footer of email notifications. If you do not want to receive email from Psyonix, please opt out of receiving emails at the bottom of any Psyonix emails or by editing your profile preferences.

We do not share your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties. Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to help us improve the Psyonix Websites and our products and services.

From time to time, we may employ and share your Personally Identifiable Information with vendors under our control who use it solely to provide support for the internal operations of our Websites (e.g., technical support and network delivery). These entities will not use your Personally Identifiable Information for any other purpose, and have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the Personally Identifiable Information they obtain from us.

It is our policy not to share, sell or rent your Personally Identifiable Information to any company not directly related to Psyonix or under our control. Psyonix reserves the right to share your Personally Identifiable Information with our affiliated companies. Further, Psyonix may sell, transfer or otherwise disclose user information, including Personally Identifiable Information, in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, the sale of substantially all assets, or other fundamental corporate change. Any such transfer shall continue to be subject to this Privacy Policy.

**_(7) What safeguards does Psyonix use to protect my Personally Identifiable Information?_**

We maintain appropriate safeguards that ensure the security, integrity and privacy of the Personally Identifiable Information we collect from all users. The Psyonix account of every user is password protected. Personal information collected by us is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public and are only accessible by authorized employees. We also have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.

**_(8) What are my privacy rights if I am located outside the United States of America?_**

Psyonix makes an effort to protect the Personally Identifiable Information of all users of our Websites. We attempt to comply with local data protection and consumer rights laws to the extent they may apply to Psyonix’s Websites, products and services. If you are uncertain whether this Privacy Policy conflicts with the applicable local privacy laws where you are located, you should not submit your Personally Identifiable Information to Psyonix. If you are located within the European Union, you should be aware that your Personally Identifiable Information will be transferred to the United States of America, the laws of which may be deemed by the European Union to have inadequate data protection. If you are located in a country outside the United States of America and voluntarily submit Personally Identifiable Information to us, you thereby consent to the general use of such information as provided in this Privacy Policy and to the transfer of that information to, and/or storage of that information in, the United States of America.

**_(9) How do I ask a question or file a complaint?_**

If you have any questions, complaints or comments regarding our Privacy Policy or practices, please contact us via email at _privacy@psyonix.com_. If you have general questions not related to privacy, you can visit our customer support page on our Websites.

**_(10) Changes in the Psyonix Privacy Policy_**

Psyonix reserves the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time. If Psyonix changes its Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on our Websites so that you and other users are always aware of what information is collected, how it is used, and under what circumstances, if any, it is disclosed. You should also check back from time to time to ensure you are aware of any changes. If we are going to use Personally Identifiable Information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify you and others via email or by placing a prominent notice on our Websites.  
**By using the Psyonix Websites, you signify your consent to the Psyonix Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use our Websites. Your continued use of our Websites will signify your acceptance of these changes.**
