This Privacy Policy does not apply to any websites, services, products or applications maintained by other companies or organizations to which we may link.

This Privacy Policy is intended to provide our Users with information about how we collect, use, disclose, and otherwise process their personal data, the choices Users have related to our processing of their personal data, and how Users can exercise their access and other rights over their personal data.

By providing your information to us through the Services, or otherwise using any of our Services, you understand, acknowledge and unconditionally accept that Harmonix may process your information, including personal data, in accordance with this Privacy Policy. **IF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS PRIVACY POLICY TO APPLY TO YOU, PLEASE DO NOT USE OR COMMUNICATE WITH US VIA ANY OF OUR SERVICES.** If you access the Services through a digital distribution platform, social networking website or mobile version thereof, you may be required to also read, accept and comply with its privacy policy.

**2\. INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT**

Harmonix collects information, including personal data, directly from Users, automatically via use of the Services, and in some cases, from third parties. The information that Harmonix collects about Users (which may be combined across Services and features) varies depending upon the particular Services used, and may involve the following:

**A. Registration.** To the extent we offer user registration on the Services, to register as a member of any of the Services, you may be required to provide us certain information that is identified on the registration page. Depending upon the Service, this may include your name, a user name and password, and other information, such as your country of residence, email, contact information and date of birth. Additional information may be requested during the registration process (but not required). Certain Services will not be available if you decline to provide the required information.

In addition to linking a Third Party Account, we also may allow you to login to certain Services through certain third party accounts, including Facebook http://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/ (each a “Third Party Account”). If you choose to login this way, you are asked to share certain information with us (which may include name, email, friends and public profile information); the specific information and whether it is required or optional is stated on the permissions page when you login with the Third Party Account.

In an effort to provide a safe and fair gaming environment to all Users, we may employ "anti-cheating" software or applications during the use of certain Services to prevent fraudulent activities and behaviors that may negatively affect the experiences of a User. When creating a profile for certain Services, we may collect data about your personal computer in order to create a hash of machine components.

**I. Information from Third Party Sites.** We also may use third party tools to help us manage and analyze our social media presence, and report on comments, mentions and other content that is posted about us on social media sites and other public channels and forums.

**4\. HOW WE MAY SHARE YOUR INFORMATION**

Harmonix may disclose your information, including personal data, as follows:

**Service Providers and Processors.** We may engage vendors, agents, service providers, and affiliated entities to provide services to us or to Users on our behalf, such as support for the internal operations of our websites, products (such as our games) and services (e.g., message board operations, and technical support processing), as well as related offline product support services, data storage and other services. In providing their services, they may access, receive, maintain or otherwise process personal data on our behalf. Our contracts with these service providers do not permit use of your personal data for their own marketing and other purposes.

**Affiliates**. We may also share your information with our affiliate companies for purposes of assisting us to operate and market our Services. Our affiliate companies are subject to this Privacy Policy when they use your information.

**Legally Required.** We may also disclose your information if we believe we are required to do so by law, or that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with legal processes; when we believe necessary or appropriate to disclose personal data to law enforcement or other governmental or regulatory authorities or the courts (in any relevant jurisdiction worldwide), such as to investigate actual or suspected fraud or violations of law, breaches of security, or breaches of this Privacy Policy; to respond to any claims against us; and, to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Harmonix, our customers, or the public.

**Corporate Transaction**. In addition, your information may be disclosed as part of any proposed or actual merger, sale, and transfer of Harmonix assets, acquisition, bankruptcy, or similar event.

**With Consent.** We may also disclose your information to any other affiliated or third parties where you have consented or requested that we do so. For example, if you win a contest or sweepstakes, we may disclose the names of winners online, and we may also share your information with third party partners and co-sponsors, where relevant; in such cases, we will clearly notify you of the sharing, and you will have the choice not to participate or to otherwise object to such sharing. Where required by applicable law, we will publish information online or in the local press and to relevant regulators identifying the winner(s) of a context or sweepstake regardless of whether or not you consent to the same.

Notwithstanding anything else in this Privacy Policy, we may share aggregate or de-identified information with third parties for research, marketing, analytics and other purposes, provided such information does not identify a particular individual and the individual cannot be re-identified.

**5\. HOW WE COLLECT YOUR INFORMATION**

We collect some information from you when you provide it to us directly, such as via an online form or when you talk with our customer experience team. We and third parties also use certain technologies described below to collect information.

We and our third-party providers may use cookies, clear GIFs/pixel tags, JavaScript, local storage, log files, and other mechanisms to automatically collect and record information about your browsing activities, gaming performance and use of the Services. We may combine this “activity information” with other personal data we collect about you. Generally, we may use this activity information to understand how our Services are used, track bugs and errors, provide and improve our Services, establish matchmaking, verify account credentials, allow logins, track sessions, prevent fraud, and protect our Services, as well as for targeted marketing and advertising, to personalize content and for analytics purposes.

Below, is a summary of some of the activities we may engage in. For more detailed information about these mechanisms and how we collect activity information, see our Cookie Policy below.

  * **Log Files.** We may collect certain activity information from log files. Log file information is automatically reported by your browser or mobile application to our servers when you access our Services. We may record certain information from these log files, including web requests, IP address, browser type and version, language information, referring and exiting URLs, links clicked, pages viewed and other similar information.
  * **Cookies.** Cookies are small files with a unique identifier that may be transferred to your browser through our websites. They allow us to remember Users who are logged in, to understand how Users navigate through and use our Services, to display personalized content and targeted ads (including on third party sites and applications).
  * **Clear GIFs, pixel tags and web beacons.** These are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies that we may use to track the online movements of Users of our Services and to personalize content. We may also use these in our emails to let us know when they have been opened or forwarded, so we can gauge the effectiveness of our communications.
  * **Anti-Cheat and Fraud Prevention Technologies.** We may use “anti-cheating” and fraud prevention tools or applications, which may collect information about your browser, device and activities within the Services, to detect and prevent fraud and cheating.
  * **Analytics Tools.** We may use internal and third-party analytics tools to collect and aggregate activity data and other data across multiple channels. Third party analytics services integrated into our Services may combine the information they collect in connection with EA's services with information they have independently collected over time and across different websites. Many of these companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies.



**6\. THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING**

We may work with third party ad networks, channel partners, measurement services and others (“third party ad companies”) to display advertising on our Services, and to manage our advertising on third party sites, mobile applications and online services. We and these third party ad companies may use cookies, pixels tags, and other tools to collect activity information on our Services (as well as on third party sites and services), as well as IP address, device ID, cookie and advertising IDs, and other identifiers, general location information, and, with your consent, your device’s geolocation information; we and these third party ad companies use this information to provide you more relevant ads and content and to evaluate the success of such ads and content.

For example, we may work with Facebook (see their privacy policy at http://www.facebook.com/policy.php, and ad preferences page http://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads) to display targeted ads to you in Facebook. We may also work with others, such as Google Ads and DoubleClick (see their privacy policy at http://www.google.com/policies/privacy and ad preferences page at http://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads/authenticated?hl=en), to display ads to you on other third- party sites, based on your use of our Services, activity information, and other interactions with us. 

Custom Audiences and Matching. Unless you have opted out, we may share certain information (such as your email address) with third parties – such as Facebook and Google – so that we can better target ads and content to our Users, and others with similar interests, within their services. These third parties use the personal data we provide to help us target ads and to enforce their terms, but we do not permit them to use or share this data with other third-party advertisers. You can opt-out of our sharing your personal information to target you this way by emailing us at privacy@harmonixmusic.com. If you opt out, we will process your opt out in a reasonable amount of time.

As noted above, you may control how Google, Facebook and other third parties display certain ads to you, as explained further in their respective privacy policies and ad preferences pages. You can also obtain more information about targeted advertising, and how to opt-out of receiving targeted ads from many third-party ad networks (including Facebook and Google), through the following:

For Users in the EU: http://www.youronlinechoices.eu (European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance)

For Users in Canada: http://youradchoices.ca/choices/ (Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada)

Opting out of participating ad networks does not opt you out of being served advertising. You may continue to receive generic or “contextual” ads on our Services. You may also continue to receive targeted ads on other websites, from companies that do not participate in the above programs.

**7\. DO-NOT-TRACK REQUESTS**

Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed above (e.g., by disabling cookies), and you may also opt out of certain third-party ad networks as discussed above. Please see our Cookie Policy below for more information.

**8\. THIRD PARTY FEATURES**

Our Services may include or incorporate social media and other third-party features (e.g., widgets, buttons, and plugins), which are operated by third party platforms and networks such Facebook, Steam, Twitch, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and others. These features are hosted by the respective third-party operator even though they appear on our Services, and the third party may collect your IP address, URL, date and time stamp, browser details and the like, subject to their own privacy policies.

**9\. COMMUNICATIONS CHOICES**

If you agree we may send direct marketing communications to you about our Services, events and promotions, we may also send you surveys, news, updates and other communications via email. If you wish to stop receiving direct marketing and these other communications from us, you may opt out as set forth below in the Access, Amendment, and Other User Rights section below. If you opt out of direct marketing communications, we may to the extent permitted by applicable law, still send you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account or our ongoing business relations. For example, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. 

In some of our mobile Services, with your consent, we may send push notifications from time-to-time in order to update you about the game, events or promotions that we may be running. If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, you may turn them off at the device level.

**10\. SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION**

The security of your information, including your personal data, is important to us. Harmonix takes steps to protect against possible breaches of our Services and the personal data we maintain. However, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure. Thus, Harmonix cannot and does not guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. We urge you to take steps to keep your information and personal data safe, such as choosing a strong password and keeping it private, as well as logging out of your User account, and closing your web browser when finished using the Services.

**11\. PERSONAL DATA RETENTION**

We will retain your personal data as long as necessary for purposes for which the personal data was collected and is used by us, as stated in this Privacy Policy.

However, if you withdraw consent or otherwise object to our collection, use and disclosure of your personal data, you may not be able to use the Services.

As such, we and our service providers may transfer your personal data to, or access it in, jurisdictions (including the United States and other jurisdictions where our service providers have operations) that do not provide equivalent levels of data protection as your home jurisdiction. We will take steps to ensure that your personal data receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it, including through appropriate written data processing terms and/or data transfer agreements.

**13\. THIRD PARTY LINKS**

Our websites may contain links to third party sites that are not owned or controlled by Harmonix. We are not responsible for the collection and use of your information by these third-party sites. We recommend that you read the privacy notice of the website to which you link before you submit any personal data.
