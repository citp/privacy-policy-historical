If you submit personally identifiable information to us through the RockYou Sites, then we use your personal information to create your account and operate, maintain, and provide you the features and functionality of the RockYou Sites.

Receiving our newsletter is offered as part of our service. If you do not wish to receive our newsletter, you may opt-out at any time by using the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each newsletter or by emailing us at [support@rockyou.com](mailto:support@rockyou.com).

Any images, captions, videos or other content that you submit to the RockYou Sites may be redistributed through the Internet and other media channels, and may be viewed by the general public.

We may use your email address for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major RockYou Site changes, new messages in your inbox, or for customer service purposes). We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the RockYou Sites and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing User preferences and trends.

_When RockYou Discloses Information_

RockYou will not share, sell, rent or trade your personal information other than as described in this privacy policy.

We provide personally identifiable information and non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf, including credit card processing. We require that our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons agree to process such information in compliance with our Privacy Policy and we use reasonable efforts, including confidentiality and security measures, to limit their use of such information.

We use a third party payment gateway. If you choose to make a purchase within one of our applications, you will be transferred to a third party payment gateway to make the payment. The third party then provides RockYou the name on the account and the amount paid so that we may complete the transaction.

We do share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the RockYou Site. RockYou may share personally-identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information with third party-affiliates and business partners for the purpose of offering greater functionality and enhanced services through RockYou or other sites, and for the purpose of communicating these services to you.

We may release personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law) or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant.

It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities, including but not limited to, fraud, potential threats to public safety or the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use, or as otherwise permitted by law.

RockYou also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information and/or non-personally identifiable information that RockYou believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our the RockYou Sites, and to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of RockYou, our Users or others.

_Your Choices_

You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through the RockYou Sites, in which case RockYou may not be able to provide certain services to you. You may update or correct your personal profile information and email preferences at any time by visiting your account profile page. Please note that media files uploaded by Users to the RockYou Sites cannot be removed and remain subject to our Terms of Use.

To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

_Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites_

RockYou allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the RockYou Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the RockYou Sites. These third-parties automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content.

RockYou does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks RockYou to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the target audience.

You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks. The RockYou Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.
