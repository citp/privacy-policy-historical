Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose online (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, within your public profile page, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others to send you unsolicited messages. RockYou is not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these public areas of the site. Your display name (not your email address) may be displayed to other Users when you upload images or videos or send messages through the RockYou Sites and other Users can contact you through messages and comments.

This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile app.

When RockYou Discloses Information

RockYou will not share, sell, rent or trade your personal information other than as described in this privacy policy.

We provide personal information and non-personal information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf, including credit card processing. We require that our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons agree to process such information in compliance with our Privacy Policy and we use reasonable efforts, including confidentiality and security measures, to limit their use of such information only as necessary to provide these services to us.

We use a third party payment gateway. If you choose to make a purchase within one of our applications, you will be transferred to a third party payment gateway to make the payment. The third party then provides RockYou the name on the account and the amount paid so that we may complete the transaction. We do share non-personal information (such as anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the RockYou Site. RockYou may share personal information and/or non-personal information with third party-affiliates and business partners for the purpose of offering greater functionality and enhanced services through RockYou or other sites, and for the purpose of communicating these services to you.

In certain situations, RockYou may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We may release personal information and/or non-personal information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law) or respond to a court order, subpoena, search warrant, or similar legal process.

It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities, including but not limited to, fraud, potential threats to public safety or the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use, or as otherwise permitted by law.

RockYou also reserves the right to disclose personal information and/or non-personal information that RockYou believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our the RockYou Sites, and to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of RockYou, our Users or others.

Your Choices

You may, of course, decline to submit personal information through the RockYou Sites, in which case RockYou may not be able to provide certain services to you. Please note that media files uploaded by Users to the RockYou Sites cannot be removed and remain subject to our Terms of Use.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
