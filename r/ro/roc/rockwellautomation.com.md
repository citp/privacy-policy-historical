  * When you voluntarily provide your personal data to us (for example, when you opted-in for our electronic mailings, when you registered for an account on a Site, when you completed a web form to access an application or register for an event) or when it is provided to us by the company or organization you work for;
  * When you participate in webinars, seminars, trade fairs, or other events;
  * From publicly available sources (for example, LinkedIn or corporate websites);
  * When you use our services (for example, customer care support, technical support); when it is necessary for us to provide or receive services or otherwise do business with you or the company or organization you belong to; and/or
  * We buy services from selected third party vendors that utilize aggregated cookies data to target ads based on common characteristics, such as industry;
  * When we have disclosed the collection and intended use to you in advance through this Policy or at the time of collection.



We also combine the personal data that we collect from different sources for the uses further described below (for example, to identify better the areas of your business interests).

You are not required to provide personal data to us; however, if you do not, we may not be able to provide certain services or information you may request.

We collect a number of different types of personal data:

  * Relevant business contact information, such as your name, the name of the company or organization you work for, your business address, your location of operation, your title, your email address, your telephone, and other business contact details;
  * Information we obtain from your registrations for and attendance of webinars, seminars, trade fairs, and other events. In connection with such events, we may also collect information on your administrative assistant, your dietary requirements, your gender, and your partner;

  * Our Sites are for persons aged 16 years or older;
  * We only conduct B2B business and do not engage in B2C business.

#### Direct Marketing

As noted above, we may wish to provide you with information about existing and new products, services, solutions, about webinars, seminars, trade fairs, and other events, and about promotions and offers, which may be of interest to you. We may also invite you to take part in market research or request feedback on our products, services, and solutions. This communication may occur by email or telephone (telemarketing).

We will obtain your consent for direct marketing through opt-in, where we are required to do so in accordance with applicable laws, and will keep track of the consent(s) provided by you.

We will ensure that any direct marketing or market research that you receive or are contacted about by e-mail will provide a simple means for you to withdraw from such further e-mail communication. For example, we may provide you with an ‘unsubscribe’ link in emails, or an email address where you can send an opt-out request.

In such cases, we would not necessarily remove all your personal data from our database(s) but would note and respect your changed direct marketing preferences.

#### Obtaining Your Consent — Communication Preferences

You may gain a lot of information about our products, services, and solutions without having to provide any personal data. However, for certain services, information and events we may require and request certain personal data. This information will enable us to provide you with additional relevant information or service and to use it for the other purposes described in this Policy or described specifically for the requested service, information or event. We will then provide you with a link to this Policy and the opportunity to configure your communication preferences within our Preference Center.

We will request, where required by applicable laws, that you grant your explicit consent for our online, electronic direct marketing activities, and for the use of our cookies. Where required, we will request that you grant your explicit consent for us to collect and use your personal data as explained in this Policy.

Such consent will be requested within the web form or hardcopy form used to collect your personal data and/or provided to you to confirm your registrations or preferences (for example, for offline activities, such as trade fairs, seminars, and other events).

In certain cases, we may also request you to confirm your consent through a link in a follow-up email (double opt-in).

When you choose or adjust your preferences in the Preference Center, you will be considered to have opted-in and to have given your explicit consent for the selected communication channels and choices and for the further collection and use of your personal data in accordance with this Policy. You may visit the Communication Preference Center at any time to withdraw your consent.

#### Information Security — Cross-border Transfers

We have adopted reasonable, risk-based, technical, and organizational measures, which seek to protect your personal data against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.

Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee the security of any transmission of personal data over the Internet, via email or other electronic communication. We also cannot guarantee the security of different methods of electronic storage. Electronic communications such as via email are not secure unless they have been appropriately encrypted. While we strive to protect such information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted or exchanged between us. You therefore accept the inherent security implications of dealing online and through email and will not hold us responsible, unless a security breach incident has been caused by the specific gross negligence of Rockwell Automation, its subsidiaries or its agents.

Given the nature of our business, the information you provide to us may be stored in and transferred to countries that offer varied levels of data protection. Often, the personal data we use under this Policy is on cloud applications and servers, which may be located around the globe. We may use and store personal data that we hold about you in any country in which we maintain offices. Transfers of personal data from the European Economic Area (EEA) to our facilities in the USA are covered by intercompany data transfer agreements meeting applicable EU privacy law. In addition, when your personal data is shared by us with or transferred by or to third parties outside of the EEA, where required, with these third parties we generally enter into data processing agreements and/or Standard Contractual Clauses meeting applicable EU privacy laws.

#### Retention

We retain your personal data in our active systems as long as you have accessed or used our Sites and services or have interacted with us online or offline over the past twelve months, and as long as we may need the information for the purposes described in this Policy. Beyond this period, we archive your personal data in a secure environment or delete it.

If you don’t log on to one of our Sites for at least twelve or more months, you hereby agree that we may permanently delete your accounts and all the data associated with it.

We may retain and use your information for longer periods as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes and/or to execute and enforce our agreements.

#### Links to Other Websites

Our Sites may contain links to other websites.  We are not responsible for the content, terms of service, security, and privacy practices of these other websites. Your access and use of such links or websites remains solely at your own risk. You should be aware of this when you leave our Sites and we encourage you to read the privacy statements on other websites you visit.

#### How to Access, Correct, or Delete Your Personal Data

Under applicable privacy laws, you have certain rights in relation to the personal data we hold about you, such as rights of information about and access to your personal data, rights to rectify your personal data, rights to reject or restrict certain processing, rights to delete your personal data and rights to be forgotten.

A number of our Sites (for example, where you have a registered account) allow you to see the personal data we hold about you, to amend and correct this information and to deactivate your registration yourself.
