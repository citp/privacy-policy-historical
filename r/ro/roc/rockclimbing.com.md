# Rock Climbing.com Privacy Policy

With a massive community, we take our users' privacy concerns very seriously. 

_We are still editing this document. Please bear with us as we try to articulate our efforts to protect your privacy as you enjoy Rockclimbing.com._

Rockclimbing.com strives to create an informative and user friendly experience for each visitor and all of our registered climbers. To do this we must collect a certain amout of information from you while you browse the site. Because you trust us with this information, we take that responsibility very seriously. 

## Your biographical information is private:

We will never, ever sell your email address or share it with marketing people. We are just as sick of SPAM as you are. This goes for any other information that you provide to us and which you do not display on your public profile. However, if you choose to publish this information in your biography, public posts, photo descriptions, articles, or any other public content, then that is your choice. 

We may, however, make use of the information you supply to target the banner ads on our site, and in aggregate to provide advertisers with demographic information about our user base. 

## Your clickthrough data is private:

This website collects information about what URLs you've clicked through on this site only and from where you were referred. We will usually only track your IP address, but in some cases we actually track your specific username. However, we only use this information in macro statistics. We will not monitor a specific user's activity per se. We will not intentionally provide this information to any third party, except as necessary for the normal technical maintenance and operation of the site. 

## This website uses cookies:

In order for this website to work effectively, it has to know who you are. Each user on this site has an account, and transactions have to be associated with that account. When you login, you are issued a cookie. Its the only way we can keep track of which account you are logged into. You must have cookies enabled in order to use this site. 

## Your passwords are encrypted:

We recognize that many of you use the same password at multiple sites. To protect your privacy, we encrypt your password using MD5 encryption. This means that we cannot read it under any circumstances. If you ask us what your password is we cannot tell you. This is a good thing. 

## Your Private Messages are private:

We do not read your private messages between users. Although, the table is accessible for routine maintenance tasks, none of the Admins have regular access to the table.
