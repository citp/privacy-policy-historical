**Information for Parents/Guardians**

RocketHub encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children to become familiar with the types of content available on the Internet. Parents and guardians should regularly oversee their children's use of e-mail and other online communications and transactional features. Control tools are available from online services and software manufacturers that can help provide a safe online environment for kids. We encourage parents to familiarize themselves with those tools and use them to customize the web experience of their children to their own parental standards. 

If you are a parent or guardian who has discovered that your child has submitted his or her personal information without your permission or consent, RocketHub will take reasonable steps to remove that information from the RocketHub database at your request. To request removal of your child's information, please send an e-mail to us at support@RocketHub .com and be sure to include your contact information in your message.
