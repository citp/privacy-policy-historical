### Cookies and Other Web Trackers

Our websites and online resources also collect other basic information about you which does not directly identify you but which may correspond with you or a particular device. We use this information to learn more about how our websites and online resources are used and to otherwise improve and administer the site. We also use this information to enable us to deliver information tailored to your interests and preferences, based on your use of the site. For example, we may collect the Internet Protocol Address assigned to your computer by your internet service provider. This address may change each time you connect to the internet (a “dynamic” IP address), or it may remain the same (a “static” IP address). In most cases, this information is collected automatically, for our legitimate business interests. In some jurisdictions, we are required to ask for your consent before collecting this information, in which case you will be presented with a choice as to whether you wish to allow the collection and use of this type of information. Please see our [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/cookie-notice.htm) for more information.

_Cookies._ Our websites may use a tracking technology called a “cookie.” A cookie is a small data file that a website can place on your computer’s hard drive, where your internet browser files are kept. Cookies enable us to recognize when a computer being used to browse our websites has previously visited a Roche website or online resource. Cookies can also be used to enable a site to “remember” the information a visitor has previously inputted. Cookies may be placed on your computer both by us and by third parties with whom we have a relationship, such as web analytic services and advertising network services.

_Web Beacons._ On certain web pages or in emails we send to you, we may utilize a technology called a “web beacon” (also known as an “action tag” or “clear GIF technology”). We may use web beacons to help determine which email messages sent by us were opened and whether a message was acted upon. Web beacons also help analyze the effectiveness of websites by measuring the number of visitors to a site or how many visitors clicked on key elements of a site.

_Social Plugins._ This site may use social plugins (e.g., the Facebook “Like” button) to enable you to easily share information with others. When you visit our site, the operator of the social plugin may be able to place a cookie on your computer, enabling that operator to recognize individuals who have previously visited our site. If you have previously logged into the associated social media website (e.g., Facebook) before browsing on our website, the social plugin allows that social media website to receive information about your visit to particular pages on our website. The social plugin may collect this information for any such visitors who have logged into social networks, whether or not they specifically interact with the plugin on our websites (e.g., by clicking “Like” or “Share”). The social plugin may also allow the social media website to share information about your activities on our websites with other users of their social media website. For further details about the information shared via a particular social media plugin, you should refer to that social media site’s privacy statement.

Certain web browsers and other programs may be used to signal your preferences to Roche about how or whether Roche or third parties may collect information about your online activities. Currently, Roche does not respond to such signals.

### Use of Data for Marketing

We will not sell or transfer your Personal Data to any non-affiliated entity for their own direct marketing use unless we provide clear notice to you and obtain your explicit consent. We use third party advertising companies to place ads on other websites. These companies may use data about your visits to this and other websites in order to measure advertising effectiveness and to provide advertisements about our goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and your choices to opt out of having this information used by these companies, see our [Cookies Policy](https://web.archive.org/cookie-notice.htm).

### Information Sharing / Recipients of Personal Data

#### Recipients of your Personal Data

We may share your Personal Data with Roche’s affiliates around the world. Our Roche affiliates will use your Personal Data for the same purposes as we do. A list of Roche’s affiliates is available in the current annual report, which can be found in the Investors section of [www.roche.com](https://web.archive.org/).

  * Where needed for corporate audits or to investigate or respond to a complaint or security threat



#### International Transfers of Your Personal Data

Any Personal Data you provide to us through your use of this website may be transferred to or stored in a geographic region which imposes different privacy obligations than your country of origin. This may mean that your Personal Data may be sent to a country with less restrictive data protection laws than your own. Any such transfer will be conducted in compliance with applicable law.

If your Personal Data is covered by the GDPR: For transfers of data within the Roche Group, contracts containing the EU Standard Contractual Clauses according to the EU Commission decisions of 27 December 2004 (2004/915/EC) and 05 February 2010 (C(2010)593) constitute appropriate and suitable safeguards to ensure compliance with GDPR. In addition to Standard Contractual Clauses, Roche may also use data processors that are certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, which establishes appropriate and suitable safeguards to ensure compliance with the GDPR according to the EU Commission decision of 12 July 2016 (C(2016) 4176).

### Retention / Storage Period of Your Personal Data

The length of time in which we will store your Personal Data will differ depending on the purpose for which we have collected and are processing your data. In most cases, we will keep the data for three (3) years following our last interaction with you. We may, however, maintain your data for a longer period of time if we are required by law to maintain your data. For example, reports related to pharmacovigilance are kept for a minimum of 10 years after the withdrawal of the product in the last country where the product is marketed.

### Information About Your Rights Regarding Your Personal Data

#### Your Rights If Your Data is Covered by the GDPR

If your Personal Data are covered by the GDPR (that is, if you are an individual within the European Economic Area), you may have certain additional rights with regards to our use and processing of your Personal Data.

You have the following rights with respect to your Personal Data:

  * The right to request access to the Personal Data that Roche has about you;
  * The right to rectify or correct any Personal Data that is inaccurate or incomplete;
  * The right to request a copy of your Personal Data in electronic format so that you can transmit the data to third parties, or to request that Roche directly transfer your Personal Data to one more third parties;
  * The right to object to the processing of your Personal Data for marketing and other purposes;
  * The right to erasure of your Personal Data when it is no longer needed for the purposes for which you provided it, as well as the right to restriction of processing of your Personal Data to certain limited purposes where erasure is not possible.



To exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the information provided above.

Please note that erasure or restriction of processing is only possible if and to the extent that the processing of Personal Data is based on consent or legitimate interest. If data processing is based on consent, note that you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, but that the withdrawal of your consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. In the event of an erasure request, we may retain a copy of your Personal Data for our record-keeping purposes and to avoid entering your personal data in our systems after your request.

In the event that you believe or have the impression that our data processing does not comply with the GDPR, you are entitled to lodge a complaint with the responsible supervisory authority.

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please use the contact information provided above.
