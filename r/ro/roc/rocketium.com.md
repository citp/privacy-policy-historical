# Privacy Policy | Rocketium

### General information

This policy sets out our privacy practices and explains how we handle the information we collect when you visit and use our sites, services, mobile applications, products, and content provided by Rocketium, in existence now or in the future (“Rocketium Services”). Please read it carefully.

### What we may collect

We collect information about what Rocketium pages you access or visit, information about your mobile device (such as device or browser type), information volunteered by you (such as through registration), the URLs of websites that referred you to us, and e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via email.

When you log into Rocketium Services or load a web page from Rocketium Services, we collect and store your Internet Protocol address. We may use this information to fight spam, malware, and identity theft; to personalize Rocketium Services for you; or to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how people use Rocketium Services.

When you create your Rocketium account, and authenticate via a third-party service like Twitter, we may collect, store, and periodically update the contact lists associated with that third-party account, so that we can make it easy for you to connect with your existing contacts from that service who are also on Rocketium.

### Email communications with us

We may occasionally need to email you some administrative info, tell you something important about your account or changes to our services, or update you on new policies. In really tough situations, like when we got dumped that one time, we might just need to vent about how unfair life is. Except for that last scenario, which won’t actually happen, these administrative communications are considered a basic part of Rocketium Services, and you may not be able to opt out from receiving them. You can always opt out of non-administrative emails.

We will never email you to ask for your password or other account information. If you receive such an email, [send it to us](mailto:contact@rocketium.com) so we can take action against the evildoer.

### Disclosure of your information

The information we collect is used to provide and improve Rocketium Services and content and prevent abuse. We don’t sell personal information about our users to any third party.

While Rocketium endeavors to provide the highest level of protection for your information, we may share your personal information with third parties in limited circumstances, including: (1) with your consent; or (2) when we have a good faith belief it is required by law, such as pursuant to any judicial or administrative order.

If we’re going to release your information, our policy is to provide you with advance notice unless we are prohibited from doing so by law or court order. If you do not challenge the disclosure request, we may be legally required to turn over your information.

We may disclose your information without providing you with prior notice if we believe it’s necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person. In that case, we will endeavor to provide you with post-disclosure notice when permitted by law.

We will independently object to requests for access to information about users of our site that we believe to be improper.

If we’re acquired by or merged with another company and your information becomes subject to a different privacy policy, we’ll notify you before the transfer. You can opt out of the new policy by deleting your account during the notice period.

### Public user content

Rocketium is meant for publishing public, not private, content. By default, whatever you share through Rocketium Services is public. Although we do provide tools that let you write and edit draft content prior to publication, you should assume that any content you provide us may become publicly accessible.

Content published and shared through Rocketium Services is publicly accessible, which means that everyone, including search engines, will be able to see it. This content may also be copied and shared by others throughout the Internet, including through features native to Rocketium Services, such as commenting and embedding.

You are free to remove published content from your account, or even disable your account entirely. However, because of the fundamentally open nature of the Internet, the strong possibility that others will comment on or embed your content, and technological limitations inherent to Rocketium Services, copies of your content may exist elsewhere indefinitely, including in our systems.

### Cookies

A cookie is a small piece of text, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, sent to and saved by your web browser when you access a website.

We use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you use Rocketium Services. We use cookies to identify.
