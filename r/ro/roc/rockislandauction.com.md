**PERSONAL INFORMATION WE GATHER**

Our goal in collecting visitor information online is to provide the best website experience possible, through delivering relevant information that meets user needs.

We receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but, by choosing to not provide such information, you might not be able to take advantage of certain features on our website. We also receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many websites, we use cookies, and we obtain certain types of information when your web browser accesses our company websites.

**REGISTERING FOR EMAIL UPDATES**

Your email address will not be sold or shared with outside companies. By signing up for our weekly email newsletter, or our auction alerts, you will be notified of special events and may be offered products for sale, including our catalogs.  Should you ever wish to remove your name from our email list, simply click the unsubscribe link.

**INFORMATION WE SHARE WITH OTHERS**

Any personal information you provide to us on our website when you register for emails, make a bid, or submit a request for information is maintained in private files on a secure Web server. Rock Island Auction Company shares this information only with affiliated companies in order to help us provide better service to you. These affiliates are required to maintain your information in the strictest confidence.

We may also share non-personally identifiable information with third party companies to help manage and optimize our online website and email communications, to process payment, and to ensure compliance with government regulations.

As we continue to develop Rock Island Auction Company, we might sell, buy, or create new businesses. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing privacy notice. Also, in the unlikely event that Rock Island Auction Company is acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.

We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our auction and collection policies, and enforce purchase, consignment, or other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of [www.RockIslandAuction.com](http://www.rockislandauction.com/), our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice.  We do not sell our clients’ information.

When using links found on our site to other websites not affiliated with Rock Island Auction Company, please be aware those sites have their own privacy policies, which may be different from our own. Also, Rock Island Auction Company is not responsible for services or products that are offered on these websites.
