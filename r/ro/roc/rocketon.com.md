  * Cookies Information:

When you visit the RocketOn Sites, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. RocketOn uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the RocketOn Sites may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.

  * Browser Plug-In:

When you use the RocketOn Browser Plug-In, we may employ web tracking and data gathering techniques which are used to track the online usage patterns of our Users anonymously (i.e. in a non-personally-identifiable manner). This information may be available to our web and advertising partners. You can turn off the web tracking and data gathering features by simply turning off the browser plug-in.

  * Log File Information:

**The Way RocketOn Uses Information:**

Submitting your personally identifiable information to us through the RocketOn Sites enable us to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the RocketOn Sites.

Any personal information, images, photos, videos, text or other content that you voluntarily disclose online (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, within your public profile page, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others. Your account name (not your email address) is displayed to other Users when you upload, post or contribute images, photos, videos, messages, text, or send messages through the RocketOn Sites, and other Users can contact you through messages and comments. Additionally, any images, photos, videos, messages, text, or other content that you submit to the RocketOn Sites may be redistributed through the internet and other media channels, and may be viewed by the general public.

We do not use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent, except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your email address without consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notification of major RocketOn Site changes or for customer service purposes).

We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the RocketOn Sites and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing User preferences and trends.

We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your subsequent visits; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests.

**When RocketOn Discloses Information:**

We provide personally identifiable information and non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf.

We do not share your personally identifiable information (such as name or email address) with other, third-party companies for their commercial or marketing use without your consent, except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out.

We do share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the RocketOn Sites.

We may release personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law), or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant.

RocketOn also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that RocketOn believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20130315114127id_/http%3A//rocketon.com/a/terms.php), take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our website, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of RocketOn, our Users or others.
