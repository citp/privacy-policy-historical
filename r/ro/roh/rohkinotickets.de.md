### **_FROM WHOM DOES TRL COLLECT DATA:_**

TRL collects information from three groups of people:

  1. **“Individuals”** , who have signed up for our mailing lists, entered one of our competitions, engaged with us on social media, completed a customer survey or otherwise interacted with us (excluding interaction in the course of business between TRL and such individual);
  2. **“Website Users”** , who visit this page, any content specific website which is owned or controlled by TRL or use our services via a third-party platform; and
  3. **Business clients and providers (“B2B”),** licensors and rights holders with whom we interact for the purpose of acquiring content for distribution, venues and platforms who have booked (or have expressed interest in booking) our content for exhibition, marketing partners, third parties whom provide us a service and/or any other individual with whom we interact solely in the course of business.



* * *

### **_WHAT INFORMATION DOES TRL COLLECT:_**

TRL collects two basic types of information _personal information_ (which can be used to identify a specific individual) and _anonymous information_ (which provides analytical information, but cannot be used to identify a specific individual); and may use personal information to create a third type of information _aggregate information_ (i.e. a collection of similar or related data).

  1. _Individuals:_



TRL collects the information you provide to us when you sign up to one of our mailing lists, request services or information from us, respond to customer surveys, participate in our activities (such as engaging with our social networks or entering our competitions), participate in other activities related to TRL communications and/or content, or otherwise interact with us using one or more devices. Such information shall include but may not be limited to:

  * If you sign up for our mailing lists or respond to customer surveys: _name, age, email address, postal/zip code, city/country of residence._
  * If you interact with us on social media (and depending on your own privacy settings): _campaign tag information (e.g. hashtags), name, social network ID, image/profile picture, email address, gender, location, date of birth and/or such other information which you have explicitly made available, either by granting access specifically to TRL or by making such information visible to the general public._
  * If you enter one of our competitions: _name, age, email address, postal/zip code, city/country of residence, telephone number.*_



*Please note that we may need to obtain additional information you if you win one of our competitions, the relevant information we need will depend on the prize you have won and may include (but shall not be limited to): your mailing address (if we need to mail you your prize) and/or your passport details (if we need to arrange travel as part of the prize).

TRL may also receive information about you from third parties either where those third parties are permitted by law to share your data; or in certain circumstances where you have expressly consented to such third party sharing your information with us for specific purposes (e.g. where you have indicated to such third party that you wish to hear more about TRL and its services and/or content) and/or information received pursuant to a contract we may have in respect of a specific piece of content or activity.

Please be aware that when you provide information to TRL through a third-party site or platform (for example, via social networks or mailing list service providers) the information which you provide may be separately collected by such third-party. **_TRL does not control third-party sites or platforms (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, MailChimp, SurveyMonkey, and Powster) and this Policy does not apply to them. Please consult the policy of the relevant third party to find out how they collect and use your information._**

  2. _Website Users:_



You make certain information available to us when you visit one of our websites or use our services via a third-party platform using one or more devices and TRL uses technology such as cookies to collect such information, insofar as we are permitted by law and where applicable, subject to your explicit consent. Such information shall include but may not be limited to:

  * _user client ID generated by Cookies which are unique to you;_

  * _campaign tag information (e.g. hashtags);_
  * _user agent information (e.g. browser type);_

  * _your IP address;_
  * _country and city location data (based on IP); and_
  * _user’s click events (i.e. where you point and click on our site)._
