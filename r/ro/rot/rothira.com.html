<p>This privacy policy (“Policy”) explains how personal information is collected, used and disclosed by Retirement Online LLC (“Retirement Online LLC”, “we” or “us”) with respect to your access and use of Retirement Online LLC’s website about Roth IRAs located at <a href="http://www.rothira.com/">www.RothIRA.com</a> (the “Site”) and the service which are available via the Site.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time. We will alert you that changes have been made to this Policy by indicating on this Policy the date it was last updated. We encourage you to review this Policy from time-to-time to make sure that you understand how any personal information you provide to us will be used.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What Is Personal Information?</h3>
<p>As used in this Policy, the term "personal information" means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as the name you provide via the Site and your e-mail address) or information about an individual that is directly linked to personal information. Personal information does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Site or about a group or category of users, from which individual identities or other personal information has been removed. This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What Information Do We Collect?</h3>
<p>Active Collection: We collect information from you in various ways when you visit the Site. For example, we collect information that you voluntarily provide to us, such as when you provide a comment. Such information may include personal information, such as the name you provide and your e-mail address.</p>
<p>Passive Collection: When you use the Site, some information is also automatically collected, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your operating system, your browser type, the address of a referring website, and your activity on the Site. We treat this information as personal information if we combine it with or link it to any of the identifying information mentioned above. Otherwise, this information is used in the aggregate only.</p>
<p>We may also automatically collect certain information through the use of "cookies." Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive at the request of a website. Among other things, cookies help us to improve the Site, and your experience on the Site. If we link cookies to any personally identifiable information, we will treat this information as personal information. If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser manufacturer to learn about these functions. However, if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services on the Site.</p>
<p>We may use Web beacons or similar technology on the Site. Web beacons are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on the Site or in emails relating to the Site to collect certain information and monitor user activity on the Site, such as to count visits, understand usage effectiveness and to determine if an email has been opened and acted upon.</p>

<li>when you give us your consent to do so (including, without limitation, if we notify you on the Site that the information you provide will be shared in a particular manner and you provide such information;&nbsp;</li>
<li>in an aggregated or anonymized form that does not directly identify you;</li>
<li>when we believe in good faith that we are lawfully authorized or required to do so or that doing so is reasonably necessary or appropriate to comply with the law or legal processes or respond to lawful requests or legal authorities, including responding to lawful subpoenas, warrants, or court orders;</li>
<li>when we believe in good faith that we are lawfully authorized or required to do so or that doing so is reasonably necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of Retirement Online LLC, our users, our employees, copyright owners, third parties or the public, including without limitation, to protect Retirement Online LLC or our users from fraudulent, abusive, inappropriate, or unlawful use of the Site;</li>
<li>to enforce or apply this Policy, the terms of use applicable to the Site, or our other policies or agreements; and</li>
