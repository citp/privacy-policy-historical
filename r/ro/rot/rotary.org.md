humanitarian service, encourages high ethical standards in all vocations, and helps build goodwill and peace in the world. Approximately 1.2 million Rotarians belong to more than 32,000 clubs in more than 200 countries and geographical areas. 

The Rotary Foundation of Rotary International is a not-for-profit corporation that is supported solely by voluntary contributions from Rotarians and friends of the Foundation who share its vision of a better world.

Together, these two entities are collectively referred to as “RI” in this privacy statement. In the course of fulfilling its mission of supporting Rotarians and their Rotary clubs, RI collects personal information regarding the individuals it serves. RI is committed to maintaining the privacy of these individuals. 

RI has adopted this privacy statement to affirm this commitment and to assure transparency in how it collects, retains and uses personal information.
