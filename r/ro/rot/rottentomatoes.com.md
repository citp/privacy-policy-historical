Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our information practices and the choices you can make about the collection and use of the personal information you submit on Web pages or for services where this policy is posted.

THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT

Registration. At some of our Web sites, applications and services ("Services"), you can order products or purchase content, enter contests, play one of our games, read critic and user reviews, vote in polls, rate movies, TV shows and other content, or otherwise express an opinion, subscribe to one of our services such as our online newsletters, or participate in our online forums or communities. In the course of using the Services, we ask you to create an account by providing us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you, as well as to administer your account. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected include: name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card and billing information, and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services. 

Information about others/inviting friends. You also can submit information about other people. For example, you might submit a person's name and e-mail address to share content or recommendations, and if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you might submit the recipient's name and address. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected about other people at these pages include: recipient's name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number. 

Some of our Services also allow you to invite your friends to join our services and to connect with you through social media features. Inviting friends is always optional. To do so, you may provide their contact information or may enter your log-in credentials to import email addresses from your address book from other sites that support such functionality (e.g., Yahoo! and Gmail). You select the friends you want to invite to share in this experience. 

Information from other sources/social networking sites. You can also engage with our content, such as video, games, applications, and other offerings, on or through (1) third-party social networking sites, such as Facebook, (2) third-party social media plug-ins and applications, and (3) our social media plug-ins and applications that may be available through third-party sites or our Services. You may also choose to link your account with us to third party social networking sites. When you link your account or engage with our content on or through third party social networking sites, social media plug-ins or applications, you may allow us to have ongoing access to certain information from your social media profile (e.g., name, e-mail address, photo, gender, birthday, location, your list of friends, people you follow and/or who follow you, the posts or the 'likes' you make). We may also maintain non-personally identifiable information (e.g., content viewed, game performance, high scores, and information about advertisements within the content you have been shown or may have clicked on, etc.) from your interaction with our content.

COLLECTION OF INFORMATION BY THIRD PARTY SITES, AD SERVERS, AND SPONSORS

Some of our Services contain links to or integrations with other sites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) whose information practices may be different than ours. Visitors should consult the other sites' or services' privacy policies before submitting any information, as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties. 

We sometimes may offer content or programs (e.g., contests, sweepstakes, promotions, games, applications or social network integrations) that are sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the activity. We have no control over these third parties' use of this information. Our Services will notify you at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if these third parties will obtain such information. 

At some of our Services, reputable third parties may present or serve the advertisements, provide us with data collection, reporting, ad response measurement, site analytics, as well as assist with delivery of relevant marketing messages and advertisements. These third parties may view, edit, or set their own cookies. The use of these technologies by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by this privacy statement. For more information about third party ad servers at our Services and your ability to opt-out of targeted advertising from such third parties, visit the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.networkadvertising.org&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNE7JEvVmIsZqyh0AH9XO3Dl7iJV2g) and/or [Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aboutads.info%2Fchoices&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHF9XatBICNjqnEKN6puV79-Ex5JA). Please note that opting-out through these programs will stop certain targeted advertising, but will still allow the collection of usage data for some purposes, including research, analytics and internal operations.

COOKIES, DO NOT TRACK, AND OTHER TECHNICAL INFORMATION

We, our third party service providers, and our partners may send "cookies" to your computer or use similar technologies to enhance your experience with our Services. "Cookies" are files that can identify you as a unique customer and store your personal preferences as well as technical information (including click through and click stream data). Cookies manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through us and/or other networks or sites. Cookies can either be permanent (i.e., they remain on your computer until you delete them) or temporary (i.e., they last only until you close your browser). 

Some of our Services may use locally stored objects (sometimes referred to as "Flash cookies") to provide certain content, such as video on demand, video clips, or animation. Adobe's Flash player (and similar applications) use this technology to remember settings, preferences, and usage similar to browser cookies. Flash cookies are not managed through your web browser, but you can access your Flash management tools from [Adobe's website](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.macromedia.com%2Fsupport%2Fdocumentation%2Fen%2Fflashplayer%2Fhelp%2Fsettings_manager07.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEoJklOxYX1fbc-eYPOBI_gs5jMYg). 

We may also use "Web beacons" that monitor your use of our Services. Web beacons (or Web bugs) are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a Web page for the purpose of transferring data, such as the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the Web beacon appears, the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the page on which the Web beacon appears, the time the page containing the Web beacon was viewed, the types of browser that fetched the Web beacon and the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server. 

When we correspond with you via HTML capable e-mail, Web beacons let us know whether you received and opened our e-mail. On their own, cookies or Web beacons do not contain or reveal any personally identifiable information. However, if you choose to furnish personally identifiable information, this information can be linked to the data stored in the cookies/Web beacons.

We do not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created.

By accepting this Privacy Policy, you specifically agree to our use of cookies and Web beacons as described herein. You may adjust your browser to reject cookies from us or from any other Web site. Additionally, by setting your Web browser to display HTML e-mails as text only, you may be able to prevent the use of some Web beacons.

However, certain areas of our Services can only be accessed in conjunction with cookies or similar devices and you should be aware that disabling cookies or similar devices might prevent you from accessing some of our content.
