Rotana may also collect non-personally identifiable information about you, such as your use of our web sites, communication preferences, travel habits, aggregated data relative to your stays, and responses to promotional offers and surveys.   
**  
PURPOSE FOR COLLECTION, PROCESSING, AND DISCLOSURE:**  
 **  
Collection & Use: **

Rotana is fully committed to providing you with information about the collection and use of personally identifiable information (PII) furnished by, or collected from, visitors while using our web sites, products and services. It is our practice not to ask you for information unless we need it or intend to use it. Some of the primary purposes for collecting your PII are as follows:

  * providing services such as processing a transaction (e.g., making a reservation, fulfilling a request for information, or completing a product order) 
  * marketing and communications with you in relation to the products and services offered by Rotana, our strategic marketing partners, and other trusted third parties 
  * performing market research via surveys to better serve your needs, improve the effectiveness of our web sites, your hotel experience, our various types of communications, advertising campaigns, and/or promotional activities 



You will always be offered the choice not to submit your PII or to decide what communications you want to receive from us. However, doing so may cause certain transactions to become affected. For example, not providing a name will prevent the processing of reservations.   
**  
Processing and Disclosure:  
**  
In most cases, the information you provide is added to a local or global database. In the course of processing your information, it may be necessary to transfer your PII to Rotana's affiliates, properties within the Rotana system and/or third party service providers located in the United States and throughout the world for the purposes outlined within this Privacy Statement. As a general practice, Rotana does not sell, rent, or give physical possession of your PII to unaffiliated third parties outside the Rotana system. Situations in which Rotana may disclose your information to others include:

  * When we have received your consent to do so 
  * In situations where sharing or disclosing your information is required in order to offer you products or services you desire (e.g., a vacation package) 
  * When companies or services providers that perform business activities on behalf of Rotana require such information (e.g., credit card processing, customer support services, market research administration or database management services) 
  * When a property leaves the Rotana system and access to your PII is necessary to facilitate business operations or meet contractual obligations 
  * In the event Rotana is merged or acquired by another company 
  * To comply with legal or regulatory requirements or obligations in accordance with applicable law or court order 
  * In case of emergency such as to safeguard the life, health, or property of an individual 



If information is shared as mentioned above, we seek to limit the scope of information that is furnished to the amount necessary for the performance of the specific function. Unless otherwise precluded by legal process, we require third parties to protect your PII and abide by applicable privacy laws and regulations.   
**  
CONSENT:**

As part of our commitment to keep you informed, we may mail, e-mail, telephone, or contact you by other means to notify you of new Rotana Hotels products and services, or upcoming Rotana Hotels special offers, events, enhancements, or other relevant information that may be of interest to you. You may also receive mailings or other communications from carefully selected third parties. We always offer you the option to decline any or all of these communications by following the directions included in our e-mails or other communications, or by contacting Rotana directly. 

If you are a Rotana Preferred Guest (Rotana Reward) program member, you may also change your communication choices by updating your e-mail preferences in your individual membership profile.   
We would like to keep all of our guests and visitors informed and equally able to take advantage of the benefits offered by Rotana and its strategic marketing partners. However, if you reside outside of the United States, certain data privacy regulations may require us to obtain your permission before we send you information that you have not requested from us. 

In some cases your permission will be implied from the nature of the service requested or transaction undertaken. For example, Rotana may collect and use personally identifiable information that you volunteer, or behavioral data or information collected in the aggregate. In addition, your permission will be deemed given for communications from us that are necessary to fulfill transactions and services that you request. 

In certain circumstances, we will seek your express permission when we collect information that is regarded under certain data privacy regulations to be sensitive in nature (e.g., information revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, or health conditions).
