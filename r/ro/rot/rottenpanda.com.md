# Privacy Policy

**Privacy Policy**

**We take your privacy very seriously.**

Last Modified: 03 Feb 2015

Rottenpanda.com takes the private nature of your personal information very seriously. See below for our privacy policy standards.

**Website Visitors**

Like most website operators, Rottenpanda.com collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Rottenpanda.com purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Rottenpanda.com visitors use its website. From time to time, Rottenpanda.com may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g. by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Rottenpanda.com also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Rottenpanda.com does not use such information to identify its visitors, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

**Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information**

Certain visitors to Rottenpanda.com websites choose to interact with Rottenpanda.com in ways that require Rottenpanda.com to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Rottenpanda.com gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for Rottenpanda.com to provide a username and email address. In each case, Rottenpanda.com collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Rottenpanda.com. Rottenpanda.com does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

**Aggregated Statistics**

Rottenpanda.com may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Rottenpanda.com may monitor the most popular collections on Rottenpanda.com. Rottenpanda.com may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Rottenpanda.com does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

**Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information**

Rottenpanda.com discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Rottenpanda.com behalf or to provide services available at Rottenpanda.com websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Rottenpanda.com websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. In addition, in some cases we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Rottenpanda.com or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Rottenpanda.com goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquiror of Rottenpanda.com may continue to use your personal and non-personal information only as set forth in this policy. Otherwise, Rottenpanda.com will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.

Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Rottenpanda.com discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Rottenpanda.com believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Rottenpanda.com, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Rottenpanda.com website and have supplied your email address, Rottenpanda.com may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Rottenpanda.com and its products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Rottenpanda.com takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

You should also be aware that if you submit information to “chat rooms,” “forums” or “message boards” such information becomes public information, meaning that you lose any privacy rights you might have with regards to that information. Such disclosures may also increase your chances of receiving unwanted communications.
