RouteNote Privacy Policy

1\. Introduction 

At RouteNote, we want to give you the best possible experience to ensure that you enjoy our service today, tomorrow, and in the future. Your privacy and the security of your personal data is, and will always be, enormously important to us. So, we want to transparently explain how and why we gather, store, share and use your personal data - as well as outline the controls and choices you have around when and how you choose to share your personal data. 

That is our objective, and this Privacy Policy (“Policy”) will explain exactly what we mean in further detail below. 

2\. About this Policy 

The Policy applies to all RouteNote services and any associated services (referred to as the ‘RouteNote Service’). The terms governing your use of the RouteNote Service are defined in our [Terms and Conditions of Use](https://routenote.com/termsandconditions) (the “Terms and Conditions of Use”). 

From time to time, we may develop new or offer additional services. If the introduction of these new or additional services results in any change to the way we collect or process your personal data we will provide you with more information and additional terms or policies. Unless stated otherwise when we introduce these new or additional services, they will be subject to this Policy. 

The aim of this Policy is to:

1\. Ensure that you understand what personal data we collect about you, the reasons why we collect and use it, and who we share it with;  
2\. Explain the way we use the personal data that you share with us in order to give you a great experience when you are using the RouteNote Service; and  
3\. Explain your rights and choices in relation to the personal data we collect and process about you and how we will protect your privacy.   


We hope this helps you to understand our privacy commitments to you.

Alternatively, if you do not agree with the content of this Policy, then please remember it is your choice whether you want to use the RouteNote Service. 

3\. Your rights and your preferences: Giving you choice and control 

You may be aware that a new European Union law, called the General Data Protection Regulation or "GDPR" gives certain rights to individuals in relation to their personal data. Accordingly, we have implemented additional transparency and access controls in our Privacy Center and Privacy Settings to help users take advantage of those rights. As available and except as limited under applicable law, the rights afforded to individuals are: 

* Right of Access - the right to be informed of and request access to the personal data we process about you;
* Right to Rectification - the right to request that we amend or update your personal data where it is inaccurate or incomplete;
* Right to Erasure - the right to request that we delete your personal data;
* Right to Restrict - the right to request that we temporarily or permanently stop processing all or some of your personal data;
* Right to Object -
* the right, at any time, to object to us processing your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation;
* the right to object to your personal data being processed for direct marketing purposes;
* Right to Data Portability - the right to request a copy of your personal data in electronic format and the right to transmit that personal data for use in another party’s service; and
* Right not to be subject to Automated Decision-making - the right to not be subject to a decision based solely on automated decision making, including profiling, where the decision would have a legal effect on you or produce a similarly significant effect.

In order to enable you to exercise these rights with ease and to record your preferences in relation to how RouteNote uses your personal data, we provide you with access to the following settings via your Account Settings page: 

* Profile Preferences - allows you to control some of the categories of personal data we process about you, enables you to access your personal data, and edit and remove your data at any point.
