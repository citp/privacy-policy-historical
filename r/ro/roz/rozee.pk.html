      <p> <strong> Policy Overview</strong></p>
      <p align="justify">Rozee.pk takes the privacy of its users very seriously. We strive to provide a safe, secure user experience. This Privacy Policy details the online data collection and usage policies and practices that apply to the Rozee.pk web site and does not apply to information we collect in any other form. </p>
      <p align="justify"> Your data will be stored and processed in whole or in part in the United States . The information we gather on the Rozee site may be shared within the Rozee-affiliated companies on a worldwide basis in order to deliver the products and services we offer to employers such as searches for job seekers or in order to undertake analysis of our database such as aggregate profiling of our registered users. "Affiliated companies" means entities that control, are controlled by or are under common control with Rozee.pk. </p>
      <p align="justify"> The Rozee site contains links to other web sites over which we have no control. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of other web sites to which you choose to link from our site. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of those sites so you can understand how they collect, use and share your information. </p>
      <p><strong> Usage and Information Collection by Rozee</strong></p>
      <p align="justify"> In some areas of Rozee we request or may request that you provide personal information, including your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, contact information and any other information from which your identity is discernible. In other areas, we collect or may collect demographic information that is not unique to you such as your age, preferences, gender, interests and favorites. Sometimes we collect or may collect a combination of these two information types. </p>
      <p align="justify"> We also gather or may gather certain information about your use of Rozee.pk, such as what areas you visit and what services you access. Moreover, there is information about your computer hardware and software that is or may be collected by us. This information can include without limitation your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring Web site addresses, however it is not linked to your personal information. </p>
      <p align="justify"> If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about Rozee or refer a job posting to a friend, we will ask you for your friend's email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Rozee website or view the job posting. We do not store this information. </p>
      <p><strong> Our Use of Your Information</strong></p>
      <p align="justify"> We use the information we gather on Rozee, whether personal, demographic, collective or technical, for the purpose of operating and improving the Rozee web site, creating a positive user experience, and delivering the tools and services that we offer. </p>
      <p align="justify"> We may use your contact information in order to send you e-mail or other communications regarding updates at the Rozee Site. </p>
      <p align="justify"> We have areas on the Rozee Site where you can submit feedback. Any feedback you submit in these areas becomes our property, and we can use such feedback (such as success stories) for marketing purposes or to contact you for further information. </p>
      <p><strong> Disclosure of Personal Information to Third Parties</strong></p>
      <p align="justify"> We do not disclose your personal information to third parties, or your combined personal and demographic information or information about your use of Rozee except as set forth below. </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <div align="justify"> We disclose information to companies and individuals we employ to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include hosting our Web servers, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance and providing customer service. These companies and individuals will have access to your personal information as necessary to perform their functions, but they may not share that information with any other third party. </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div align="justify">
            We disclose information if legally required to do so, if requested to do so by a governmental entity or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect our rights or property or our affiliated companies; (c) prevent a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the public. </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div align="justify"> We disclose and transfer information to a third party who acquires all or a substantial portion of our business, whether such acquisition is by way of merger, consolidation or purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets. In addition, in the event we become the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, whether voluntary or involuntary, we or our trustee in bankruptcy may sell, license or otherwise dispose of such information in a transaction approved by the bankruptcy court. You will be notified of sale of all or a substantial portion of our business to a third party via email or through a prominent notice posted on the Rozee Website. </div>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong> Other Uses of Your Information</strong></p>
      <p align="justify"> We also share aggregated anonymous information about visitors to Rozee with its clients, partners and other third parties so that they can understand the kinds of visitors to the Rozee Site and how those visitors use the Rozee Site.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Personal Information on Resumes and Profiles</strong></p>
      <p> Since Rozee is a career site, we give you two options regarding the accessibility of your resume: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <div align="justify"> You can store your resume in our database, but not allow it to be searchable by potential employers. This means that you can use it to apply for a job online; however employers and recruiters will not have access to search it through our resume database. </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div align="justify"> If you have a confidential resume, but apply to a job posting on Rozee, the employer to whom you send your resume will be able to view your contact information. </div>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p align="justify"> We attempt to limit access to our searchable resume database (or copies thereof) only to registered employers, recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters, and human resource professionals, as well as law enforcement and national security agencies, but cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to this database. We are not responsible for the use made of resumes by third parties who access such resumes while they are in our searchable database. </p>
      <p align="justify"> You may remove your resume on Rozee or delete your profile on Rozee at anytime, but, employers, recruiters and others who have access to Rozee resume database as well as parties who have otherwise gained access may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use or privacy of resumes or profiles in these instances. </p>
      <p><strong> Posting to Public Areas of Rozee</strong></p>
      <p align="justify"> Please remember that if you post any of your personal information in public areas of Rozee such as the searchable resume database, such information may be collected and used by others over whom we have no control. We are not responsible for the use made by third parties of information you post or otherwise make available in public areas of Rozee. </p>
      <p><strong> Use of Cookies</strong></p>
      <p align="justify"> We use "cookies" to help personalize and maximize your online experience and time online. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard drive by a Web page server. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. </p>
      <p align="justify"> One of the primary purposes of cookies is to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Rozee pages, or register for services, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information (such as user name, password and preferences). Because of our use of cookies, we can deliver faster and more accurate results and a more personalized site experience. When you return to Rozee, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that you customized. <br>
          <br>
  You may have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline all cookies if you prefer. Alternatively, you may be able to modify your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis. If you choose to decline cookies, however, that may hinder performance and negatively impact your experience on Rozee. </p>
      <p><strong> Modification of Your Information</strong></p>
      <p align="justify"> You may review, correct, update or change your Rozee account profile at any time.<br>
          <br>
  If you opted to receive job postings, commercial e-mails or other communications from Rozee or third parties at the time you created a Rozee account, but subsequently change your mind, you may opt-out by editing your Rozee Account Profile as described above. If you previously opted not to receive such communications, you may later opt-in by editing your Rozee Account Profile as well.<br>
  <br>
  We retain indefinitely all the information we gather about you in an effort to make your repeat use of Rozee, practical, and relevant. Of course, you can delete your resume from Rozee’s online database and close your Rozee account at any time by informing us via our feedback form. In such an event we will remove all our copies of your resume from Rozee, your Rozee account information and remove your profile, except for an archival copy which is not accessible on the Internet. </p>
      <p><strong> Security of the Profile Information</strong></p>
      <p align="justify"> We have implemented commercially reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Children’s use of Rozee</strong></p>
      <p> The Rozee web site is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. </p>
      <p><strong> Privacy Policy Modifications</strong></p>
      <p align="justify"> If we decide to materially change our Privacy Policy for Rozee, we will post those changes through a prominent notice on the web site so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and to whom we will disclose it. </p>
      <p align="justify"> If at any time, you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or believe that we have not adhered to this Privacy Policy, please feel free to use our feedback form. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly answer your question or resolve your problem. </p>
      <p><strong> Contact Information</strong></p>
