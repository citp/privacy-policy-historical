The BUYER PROTECTION icon below a merchant's name indicates that purchases made through Yahoo! Shopping at that merchant's site are protected from some types of fraud by the Yahoo! Buyer Protection Program.

All Yahoo! Store merchants and Yahoo! Shopping advertising partners are eligible to participate in this program. These merchants must earn and maintain a minimum 3-star average merchant rating. Purchases made from merchants which display the Buyer Protection icon at the time of purchase are covered by the program regardless of the merchant's status at the time a claim is filed. Important limitations apply. Please see the [Yahoo! Buyer Protection Program page](http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/_ylt=ArgJ_pE6WRqSmBgyzfObtg4M6b0F/SIG=11kdklqhv/**http%3A//help.yahoo.com/help/us/shop/shop-75.html) for more details.
