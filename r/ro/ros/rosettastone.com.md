The Fairfield Language Technologies privacy policy represents a commitment to protecting your private information by both Fairfield Language Technologies (the developers of the Rosetta Stone) and our Co-Marketing partners. Information provided by you may be requested from one of our Fairfield Language Technology websites under the Rosetta Stone brand name, or from one of many of our reputable Co-Marketing partner sites that represent our Rosetta Stone brand on their own websites under their company and/or brand name.  In the event that you provide us with personal information for the purposes of free registration and you later make a purchase, whether directly with Fairfield Language Technologies, or facilitated by one of our e-commerce partners such as Yahoo!, your privacy rights will be protected according to our stated policies and the stated privacy policies of these partners, which will be posted and available for your review at the time of purchase.   
  
Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.   
  
The types of personal information we collect include all the information entered on the Registration and/or Order Form pages: shipping and billing name and address, email address, phone number and credit card information. We collect this information from you using the Fairfield Language Technologies Store hosting and backend services.  We currently contract with several online partners to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications. We use the services of a marketing company to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our site. To do this, we use Action Tags and cookies provided by our marketing company on this site. The information we collect helps us learn things like what kinds of customers our site attracts, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. Although our marketing company logs the information coming from our site on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used. If you do not want to help us learn how to improve our site, products, offers and marketing strategy, you can "opt-out" of this web-site analysis tool by  [**clicking here.** ](http://optout.rs.rpts.net/cgi-bin/rpts/optout.pl)  
  
We use the information you provide when placing an order to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order or to provide services where the outside party is acting on our behalf and has no independent right to use the information we provide (i.e. a third party shipping or customer support center).  We use aggregate information to better design our website and to share with potential business partners. For example, we may tell a potential partner that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of people from a certain zip code purchased certain items, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.  We may contact you from time to time regarding your order status or about products or specials that we think you may be interested in. If you do not wish to receive these notifications, we will honor your request not to send them to you.  We use return email addresses from your email correspondence to us to answer the email we receive. Such addresses from your correspondence are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. Finally, we do not use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without providing you an opportunity to tell us not to allow such unrelated uses.   
  
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we do not collect or maintain information from our online store from those we know are under the age of 13.   
  
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.   
  
Access and Data Correction

You can correct your order and contact information by contacting Fairfield Language Technologies, or by using the forms accessible on our website.
