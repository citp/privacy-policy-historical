<p>We recognize that your privacy is important. This document
outlines the types of personal information we receive and
collect when you use www.rose-gardening-made-easy.com, as well as some
of the steps we take to safeguard information. We hope this
will help you make an informed decision about sharing
personal information with us.

</p><p>www.rose-gardening-made-easy.com strives to maintain the highest
standards of decency, fairness and integrity in all our
operations. Likewise, we are dedicated to protecting our
customers', consumers' and online visitors' privacy on our
website.

</p><p><b>Personal Information</b>

</p><p>www.rose-gardening-made-easy.com collects personally identifiable
information from the visitors to our website only on a
voluntary basis. Personal information collected on a
voluntary basis may include name, postal address, email
address, company name and telephone number.

</p><p>This information is collected if you request information
from us, participate in a contest or sweepstakes, and sign
up to join our email list or request some other service or
information from us. The information collected is internally
reviewed, used to improve the content of our website, notify
our visitors of updates, and respond to visitor inquiries.

</p><p>Once information is reviewed, it is discarded or stored in
our files. If we make material changes in the collection of
personally identifiable information we will inform you by
placing a notice on our site. Personal information received
from any visitor will be used only for internal purposes and
will not be sold or provided to third parties.

</p><p><b>Use of Cookies and Web Beacons</b>

</p><p>We may use cookies to help you personalize your online
experience. Cookies are identifiers that are transferred to
your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to
enable our systems to recognize your browser. The purpose of
a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to
a specific page. For example, if you personalize the sites
pages, or register with any of our site's services, a cookie
enables www.rose-gardening-made-easy.com to recall your specific
information on subsequent visits.

</p><p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by
modifying your Web browser; however, if you choose to
decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the
interactive features of the site.

</p><p>A web beacon is a transparent image file used to monitor
your journey around a single website or collection of sites.
They are also referred to as web bugs and are commonly used
by sites that hire third-party services to monitor traffic.
They may be used in association with cookies to understand
how visitors interact with the pages and content on the
pages of a web site.

</p><p>We may serve third party advertisements that use cookies and
web beacons in the course of ads being served on our web
site to ascertain how many times you've seen an
advertisement. No personally identifiable information you
give us is provided to them for cookie or web beacon use, so
they cannot personally identify you with that information on
our web site.

</p><p>Browsers can be set to accept or reject cookies or notify
you when a cookie is being sent. Privacy software can be
used to override web beacons. Taking either of these actions
shouldn't cause a problem with our site, should you so
choose.

</p><p><b><a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html">Google Ad and Content Network Privacy Policy Update</a></b>

</p><p>Browsers can be set to accept or reject cookies or notify you when a cockie is being sent.
Privacy software can be used to override web beacons.
Taking either of these actions shouldn't cause a problem with my site should you so choose.

</p><p><b>Non-Personal Information</b>

</p><p>In some cases, we may collect information about you that is
not personally identifiable. We use this information, which
does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to
administer the site, to track users' movements around the
site and to gather demographic information about our user
base as a whole.  The information collected is used solely

</p><p>If www.rose-gardening-made-easy.com is sold, the information we have
obtained from you through your voluntary participation in
our site may transfer to the new owner as a part of the sale
in order that the service being provided to you may
continue. In that event, you will receive notice through our

make reasonable efforts to ensure that the purchaser honors
any opt-out requests you might make of us.

</p><p>Additional Note: Google Adsense

</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you elect to click on an ad generated by Google AdSense, make note of their policies as follows:

</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Google Advertising Cookie and Privacy Policies

</p><p>What is the DoubleClick DART cookie?

</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The DoubleClick DART cookie is used by Google in the ads served on publisher websites displaying AdSense for content ads. When users visit an AdSense publisher's website and either view or click on an ad, a cookie may be dropped on that end user's browser. The data gathered from these cookies will be used to help AdSense publishers better serve and manage the ads on their site(s) and across the web.

</p><p>Google and the DoubleClick DART cookie:

</p><p>* Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on your site. * Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and other sites on the Internet. * Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy. 

</p><p>Because publisher sites and laws across countries vary, we're unable to suggest specific privacy policy language. However, you may wish to review resources such as the Network Advertising Initiative, or NAI, which suggests the following language for data collection of non-personally identifying information:

</p><p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here.

</p><p>You can find additional information in Appendix A of the NAI Self-Regulatory principles for publishers (PDF). Please note that the NAI may change this sample language at any time.

</p><p>For more information, you can read Google's policy on Adsense here:
