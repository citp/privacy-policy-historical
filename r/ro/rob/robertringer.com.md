# Privacy Policy

A Voice of Sanity in an Insane World takes individual privacy very seriously. We are also aware of the threats to your security and privacy on the Internet. Please take a few moments to review the steps that A Voice of Sanity takes to ensure your privacy and security while giving you the best possible customer service as you use our web sites.

 **Ordering Online**

Any data you submit to us through an online order form is transferred to us via a Secure Sockets Layer-an encryption protocol-and is kept in databases that cannot be accessed from outside our firewall.

In other words, any data you send us is encrypted, so in the unlikely event a hacker intercepts your data, it cannot be easily read. Our firewall is a mechanism that prevents access to our servers by unauthorized persons.

A Voice of Sanity does not sell or rent your name to anyone. That means that only those authorized by A Voice of Sanity ever have access to any information you submit. We may use your name and address to send you information on other Voice of Sanity products that may suit your interests. And, although we disagree with it, we must turn over any pertinent information to any law enforcement agency that takes the proper steps to require it.

If at any time you wish to be removed from our mailing list, please contact us by clicking Support or by using the unsubscribe link included in every email we send out.

 **E-mail**

If you subscribe to A Voice of Sanity, your e-mail address will be placed in a database. As with all other personal information, only employees of A Voice of Sanity have access to this data. We do not give A Voice of Sanity addresses to outside companies. We will also never rent or sell out email address.

Any e-mail you send to A Voice of Sanity is completely confidential. We will not add your name to our e-mail list without your permission. For security reasons, if your inquiry is about one of your subscriptions, we may ask you to submit some additional information only to verify your identity. Remember, in this case we are only asking you to confirm information you have already given us.

If you have any questions or comments you can reach us by clicking Support.
