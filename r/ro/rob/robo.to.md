**PARTICLE PROGRAMMATICA PRIVACY POLICY**
    
    
    
    Particle Programmatica has created this privacy statement ("Privacy Policy") to explain and summarize how we collect, use and protect, or in some cases do not protect, your personal information as you interact with us online through the website (the "Website").  Particle Programmatica reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time by posting a new privacy statement at this location.  Therefore, you are responsible for periodically checking the Privacy Policy for changes.  Your use of the Website is governed at all times by the Particle Programmatica Terms and Conditions of Use.  If you are visiting from outside the United States there may be special rules or limitations on your use of this Website.  
    
    **1.	INFORMATION WE COLLECT** 
    
    Particle Programmatica collects and uses information you provide to us or that we learn from your use of this Website.  Particle Programmatica does not share your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.  We may share your personal information where it is necessary for us to complete a transaction or do something that you have asked us to do.  Whenever we may need to share your personal information, we try to provide you with the information you need to make informed choices.  
    
    Particle Programmatica collects and uses personal information from you in several ways: 
    
    User Accounts.  In order to access certain areas of the Website, you may be required to create a user account and/or provide certain personal information such as your name, your email address, your telephone number, your address, your birth date, your gender, and other personal information.  With your consent, we may also use the information you provide in online registration forms to notify you periodically about important changes to the Website (such as a change to this Privacy Policy or notice of a security breach), new Particle Programmatica products and services, and special offers and contests that may be of interest to you.  Regardless of any other provision of this Privacy Policy, we will permanently store any personal information provided by you via such registration process.  
    
    Where you provide optional information, such as information about your interests and hobbies, Particle Programmatica only uses this information on an aggregate basis to enable us to better understand our users, develop new products, and improve our products and services.  Where practical, Particle Programmatica limits the access of our service providers and vendors who assist with technical support and customer service through the use of confidentiality provisions and agreements that are intended to enforce this Privacy Policy.
    
    Website Usage.  Particle Programmatica, or Particle Programmatica authorized service providers, may observe your activities, preferences, and transactional data (such as your IP address and browser type) relating to your use of this Website.  While we may collect or log this information, we generally do not identify you or match this information with your other personal information.  We may use this collected or logged information to diagnose website technical problems, to facilitate your use of the site, or to track aggregate traffic patterns throughout the Website.  
    
    Online Transactions.  If we offer you the opportunity to purchase products online and you choose to purchase such products, you may be asked to share personal information in addition to the information provided to create a user account, such as credit card information, in order to complete a transaction.  In addition, you may be asked for information needed to complete your order, contact you to confirm the order, and provide related customer service.  This information is used, for example, to effect your transactions, to create and share aggregate reports about these transactions, and to perform credit fraud screening services for transactions between you and Particle Programmatica and/or our authorized service providers.  
    
    Recruitment and Job Applications.  You may provide us with personal information, such as that contained on a resume or a curriculum vitae, in connection with a job application or inquiry.  We may use this information throughout Particle Programmatica (worldwide) for the purpose of employment consideration or your inquiry.  We may keep your information on file for a reasonable period of time for future consideration.
    
    Public Areas.  Any information disclosed in public areas of the Website will become public information.  We cannot control the use of information disclosed in public forums, such as bulletin boards, news groups, communication facilities and chat rooms.  You should exercise caution when disclosing information in these public areas and should refrain from disclosing your personal information.  Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas, including your name, becomes available to the public and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.
    
    Particle Programmatica WILL TREAT ANY MESSAGE BOARD POSTINGS, FEEDBACK, EMAILS OR SUGGESTIONS YOU PROVIDE TO US AS NON-CONFIDENTIAL AND NON-PROPRIETARY.  IF YOU CHOOSE TO USE YOUR REAL NAME, YOUR NAME WILL BE AVAILABLE TO AND VIEWABLE BY ANYONE USING THE WORLD WIDE WEB AND/OR USING A SEARCH ENGINE.
    
    **2.	USE OF COLLECTED INFORMATION**
    
    Certain Third Party Transactions.  Particle Programmatica may work with some authorized service providers to provide technical and customer support, shipping, credit card processing, product fulfillment or other services.  Where practical, Particle Programmatica shall require these service providers to safeguard personal information you provide to us.  To the extent it is necessary for these service providers to complete their contractual obligations to Particle Programmatica, these third parties may have access to or process your personal information.  Particle Programmatica generally limits their use of your personal information to the purpose for which it was shared.  Particle Programmatica may sometimes permit our authorized service providers to have access to aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information.

If Particle Programmatica should ever file for bankruptcy or merge with another company, or if Particle Programmatica should decide to buy, sell or reorganize some part or all of its business, Particle Programmatica may be required to disclose your personal information to prospective or actual purchasers or receive personal information from sellers.  It is Particle Programmatica's practice to seek appropriate protection for information disclosed or received in these types of transactions.
    
    As Required by Law and Other Extraordinary Disclosures.  Particle Programmatica may be required to disclose your personal information if it: (a) believes it is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process (such as a court order, subpoena, search warrant, etc.) or other legal requirements of any governmental authority; (b) would potentially mitigate our liability in an actual or potential lawsuit; (c) is otherwise necessary to protect our rights or property; or (d) is necessary protect the interest of other users of our Website.

Doing this allows the advertising network to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content.  In this way, they may compile information about where individuals using your computer or browser saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked.  Particle Programmatica does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third party advertisers.  Third party advertisers have no access to your contact information stored on the Website unless you choose to share it with them.
