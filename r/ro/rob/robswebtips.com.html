<td>Undergroundimsecrets only contacts individuals who specifically request that 								we do so or in the event that they have signed up to receive our free 								newsletters or have purchased one of our products. Undergroundimsecrets collects 								personally identifying information from our users during online registration 								and online purchasing. Generally, this information includes name and e-mail 								address for registration to receive our free newsletters and name, postal address, 								and credit card information when purchasing our products. All of this information 								is provided to us by you.</td>

Undergroundimsecrets does not sell, exchange, or release your personal 								information (name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit data, 								etc.) Your information is not shared with any other 								third party or company outside of billing and shipping purposes.</td>

<td class="heading">What are cookies/clear GIFs and how do we use them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cookies: Like many other commercial sites, our Site utilizes standard technologies  								called "cookies" and clear GIFs to collect information about how our Site is used.  								A cookie is a small data text file, which a website stores on your computer's hard  								drive (if your web browser permits) that can later be retrieved to identify you to  								us. Cookies were designed to help a website recognize a user's browser as a previous  								visitor and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set while the  								user was browsing the site. A cookie cannot be read by a website other than the one  								that set the cookie. A cookie cannot pass on a computer virus or capture any of the  								Personally Identifiable Information that resides on your computer.<br><br> Clear GIFs: At times, we work with third-party service partners that employ clear GIFs  								(also known as pixel tags, single pixel GIFs, web beacons or action tags) for our benefit  								to help us measure advertising effectiveness. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique  								identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of  								our users. The main difference between the two is that clear GIFs are invisible on the  								page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.  								Clear GIFs are not tied to your Personally Identifiable Information and only track the  								visitor traffic and behavior to and on our Site.<br><br> Clear GIFs can "work with" existing cookies on a computer if they are both from the same  								website or advertising company. That means, for example, that if a person visited  								"www.companyX.com", which uses an advertising company's clear GIF, the website would match  								the clear GIFs identifier and the advertising company's cookie ID number, to show the past  								online behavior for that computer. This collected information can be shared with the  								advertising company. We do, at times, provide such information to our third-party advertising  								service partners, but that information can only be used by our partner for our benefit and  								never includes personally identifiable information.</td>
