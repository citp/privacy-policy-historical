# Robins Federal Credit Union | Privacy Policy

#### Privacy Policy

It is the policy of Robins Federal Credit Union (RFCU) to hold member information in confidence, subject to applicable legal requirements. RFCU will not sell member information for use to a non-affiliated third party.

To protect member privacy RFCU controls the way any information about members is shared with vendors. If any of our vendors require to use member information in order to provide services to members, we require the vendor to provide us with a confidentiality agreement. A member may request to be excluded from receiving credit union materials, and or marketing materials from third party vendors, by submitting your request in writing to: 

**Robins Federal Credit Union  
P.O.Box 6849  
Warner Robins, GA 31095-6849**

**E-Mail:** Information contained in e-mail sent by members and non-members may be used by the staff to answer questions, to follow-up on suggestions or complaints, or to improve service at RFCU. The most important issue you must be advised on is e-mail may not be secure against interception by unauthorized individuals. Therefore, if you wish to communicate sensitive or personal information, you may want to send it by postal mail.

**Cookies:** In order to provide optimal security, performance and reliability, our home banking and bill pay services require that cookies be enabled on your Web browser. Cookies are a small piece of information that a Web server can store on your browser so the system recognizes your actions during a session. For example, if there has been no activity for several minutes during an open session some cookies are used to automatically terminate your session in case you forget to log out.

Cookies cannot be used to obtain data from your computer, get your e-mail address or access sensitive or personal information. When you close your browser, some cookies are stored in your computer's memory in a cookie file, while some expire immediately. All cookies have expiration dates.
