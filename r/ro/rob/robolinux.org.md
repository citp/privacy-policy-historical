# Robolinux.org Privacy Statement

**What We Do To Protect You.**  
Robolinux.org finds that the best way to protect our customers on the Internet is to inform them about what information we gather, how we use it and how we protect your information. We do not sell or rent your personal information to other advertisers or third parties. 

**What information do we collect? How do we use it?**  
When you order, Paypal needs to know your name, street address, e-mail address and daytime telephone number and your credit card information. This allows them to process and fulfill your order and to telephone you if they have a question on your order. Robolinux.org does not collect any information unless you email us. 

We may also use the information we collect to notify you from time to time about new services and special offers we think you'll find valuable. These solicitations will be e-mailed to you only. Your phone number will not be used for marketing and will not be contacted unless there is a problem with your account.

**How do we protect customer information?**  
When you place orders Paypal uses a 128 bit encryption secure server. The secure server software encrypts all information you input before it is sent to them. Furthermore, all of the customer data they collect is protected against unauthorized access. 

**What about "cookies"?**  
"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that. We only use cookies to (i) keep track of your order when you visit the site, (ii) tell us whether you have visited our site previously, and (iii) help us determine whether you came from a particular site or advertisement. 

**Your Consent**  
By using our website, you consent to the collection and use of this information by Robolinux.org Inc If in the future the need arises to change our privacy policy, all changes will be posted on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
