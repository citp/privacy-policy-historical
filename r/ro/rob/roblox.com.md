# ROBLOX Privacy Policy

##  About ROBLOX

ROBLOX Corporation (“ROBLOX”) is an online virtual world and building game. Your privacy is important to us; this is why we created this Privacy Policy so that you are aware of what information is collected, how we use it and who we share it with. Our offices are located at 

60 East Third Avenue, suite 201   
San Mateo, California, 94401. 

This privacy policy covers the site [www.roblox.com](http://www.roblox.com/) and our Mobile App. 

ROBLOX works like this: 

  * a user creates a username and a virtual avatar that is his or her identity in the ROBLOX world 
  * users interact with other users through in-game chat, personal messaging (site contained), and user forums; privacy settings allow users or parents to restrict communications with other users 
  * each user is given one or more pieces of virtual real estate on which they can build houses, cars, machines, or anything else you can build with building blocks; these places are called "games" 
  * users search for, find, and play games made by other users; they play these games with other users from around the world, and are identified only by their virtual avatar name 
  * users earn tickets and/or ROBUX, our virtual currency; users earn these in a variety of ways, and use them to buy items for their characters, including virtual hats, shirts, and pants; users can also sell these items, earning tickets and/or ROBUX 
  * users can purchase premium services, including: Builder’s Club, a monthly subscription that grants the user more virtual places and a daily allowance, among other things; user may also purchase ROBUX with which they may buy virtual goods on the site 
  * users may sign up to receive our monthly newsletter; they may opt-out at any time by following the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each communication. 



##  Requested Information

ROBLOX users may play as guests; in this mode, users remain anonymous and interact with the website and game with no free chat, no personal messaging to or from users, no posting to the forums, and other restrictions designed to prevent users from sharing personally identifiable information, intentional or otherwise. As guests, users are unable to save play statistics, accumulate points, share models, or participate in our virtual economy. 

Users wishing to save statistics, share models, and participate in the economy are required to enter a username and password. We advise users to create a username that does not reflect their own name nor reveal personally identifiable information. We also advise users to pick a password that is not easy to guess, and to not share that password. For security reasons, we store passwords in encrypted form. 

User Names are used for participating in site features and are not used to identify individual users outside of their activities on our site. Usernames are not passed along to 3rd parties except in the case where a purchase is made to be credited to the account. In this case our purchasing vendor is given the account name in order to credit the account when the transaction is completed. 

All users are asked for, but are not required to give, an email address on signup. Under 13 users are required to give us a parent email, which is then verified, in order to receive the ROBLOX newsletter. Under 13 users who wish to change or add an email address to their account must contact ROBLOX via email at [info@roblox.com](mailto:info@roblox.com). If there is no verified parent email address they are required to provide us with one which is then verified in order to proceed. 

Registered users who are under 13 after first signing up are put into Privacy Mode. Privacy Mode limits who may interact with a user outside of games and limits the user to a whitelist-filtered language system in all public areas of the site. To opt-in to black-list filtered free-chat mode users must have their parents contact ROBLOX Customer Service for assistance by writing to [info@roblox.com](mailto:info@roblox.com). ROBLOX requires a verified email address for the parents in order to change this setting. In addition, ROBLOX uses the verified parent email address to notify parents of other change requests such as receiving newsletters and participation in certain activities on the site. 

All text on the site is filtered proactively to remove references to addresses, emails, phone numbers, age, and other personally identifiable information regardless of security and privacy settings. All text is also filtered for profanity, phishing, and adult or suggestive content. Our system is a combination of human and automated processes; like all filtering technology, our processes are not 100% effective. 

Users wishing to purchase Builders Club or ROBUX are required to enter billing information, including name, billing address, credit card or PayPal number, and billing email. For children under 13, we request the parent’s billing information. Billing information is retained to support customer service inquiries, but we do not retain the full credit card number. 

If you (or your child) choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site; ROBLOX does not store this information. 

If your child opts-in to receiving our monthly newsletter we will send you a notice at the email address provided during the sign up process in order to allow you to opt them out of receiving it if you wish to do so. You may opt your child out at any time by clicking the opt-out link in the newsletter verification email. We use your child’s username to send them service related messages and allow other users of the site to communicate with them. If you no longer wish to allow your child to receive such communications please contact us at [info@roblox.com](mailto:info@roblox.com) or update their communications within their account. We do not collect any personally identifiable information from children other than the parent’s email address, and a username and password. 

We do not ask you for, access, or track any location based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our Mobile Application or Services. 

##  Collected Information

ROBLOX and our third party advertisers use cookies, beacons, tags and scripts and other tracking technologies. These technologies are used to store users’ preferences, analyze trends, administer the site, tracking users’ entry onto and movements within the ROBLOX website (this helps us credit advertisers appropriately, and measure the health and effectiveness of our website), provide payment fraud protection, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We use tracking to determine if new page designs are user friendly or too complicated. Our tracking approach is industry standard, and includes IP address and non-personally identifiable information such as browser type, and date/time. We only use IP address, browser type and date/time for support for the internal operation of our website. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis. These technologies do not store personally identifiable information. For account security purposes, we may store a cookie that contains the encrypted user password; the original password cannot be recovered by hackers. Users who disable cookies in their browsers will not be able to logon to the ROBLOX website or play the ROBLOX game. 

Under 13 user accounts receive ads through a separate and different feed. These users see ads served either by ROBLOX or by 3rd parties, and in no case does the ad server retain data about the user’s online activities beyond that necessary for the delivery of the ad. 

Geolocation information about accounts is not collected or stored by ROBLOX when using a mobile application on our site. 

We also collect performance data from within ROBLOX Studio or the ROBLOX Player. We use this data retrospectively to improve the user experience of our games. This information includes in-game networking activity, CPU load, and resource usage, among other relevant data. 

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when users over 13 visit our Web site. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) or <http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/>. 

We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile Software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and from where the application was downloaded. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile application. 

####  Local Storage - HTML 5 

We use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML 5 to store content and preferences. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML 5 LSOs. 

####  Log Files 

As true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We do not link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you. 

Additionally, when visitors come to our site, we automatically collect some non-personally identifiable “computer” information, such as the type of computer operating system (e.g., Windows 95 or Mac OS), the web browser (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer) being used, IP address, and information regarding the Internet service provider. This information is used to provide technical and community support. 

##  Information Sharing

We will share your personally identifiable information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell your personally identifiable information to third parties. 

We pass user billing information on to our transaction processing partners. This is done for non-anonymous payment types, including credit card, Pay by Phone, and PayPal payments. For recurring monthly transactions, PayPal retains the credit card authorization on file, but we do not. 

We share aggregate web activity data, such as page views and unique visitor counts, with our advertising partners. No personally identifiable information is shared. 

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site. 

To the extent permitted by applicable law, we also may disclose personally identifiable information in response to a law enforcement agencies or other public agencies (including schools or children services) request or if we feel that such disclosure may prevent the instigation of a crime, facilitate an investigation related to public safety or protect the safety of a child using our website, protect the security or integrity of our website, or enable us to take precautions against liability. 

We will not use or transfer personally identifiable information in ways that are materially different from the ones described above without also providing parental notification of such practices and obtaining consent for any materially different uses. 

Parents have the right to consent to the site’s use of their child’s personally identifiable information without having to consent to the disclosure of that information to third parties as we do not share children’s information with third parties. 

##  Security & Privacy

The security of your personally identifiable information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). 

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

If you use a bulletin board, blog, or chat room on this Web site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums. 

If a user under 13 uses our bulletin board, blog or chat room on this Web site these features are moderated so that users are unable to post personally identifiable information about themselves. However, no use of moderation is 100% effective and you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there could be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums. 

To request removal of yours or your child’s personally identifiable information from our blog, or community forums, contact us at [info@roblox.com](mailto:info@roblox.com). In some cases, we may not be able to remove such personally identifiable information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. 

##  Options for Parents 

When a child enters a parent’s email address during signup, the parent receives an email notification of the account creation and an invitation to review chat and privacy settings for the account. The parent may also provide their consent to allow their child to receive targeted ads on our site at this time. 

A parent receiving a verification email has two options. First, the parent can choose not to respond; in this case, the child remains with all default privacy settings and whitelisted chat options. Second, the parent can choose to click the link in the email and review the settings; in this case, the child may be opted-in to free (but filtered) text communications, including free-text chat and personal messaging (site limited), forum posts, and site commentary. A child can send an email request to their parent to change the settings at any time. 

Requests for changes to an account can be made by contacting [info@roblox.com](mailto:info@roblox.com). Parents can close a child’s account by contacting ROBLOX customer service at [info@roblox.com](mailto:info@roblox.com). This hides the account from all other ROBLOX users and outside parties. The account data is not deleted, but retained internally for three purposes. Billing information and transaction histories are retained to resolve subsequent billing disputes and inquiries. Public domain content is retained for use by the community – e.g. a virtual shirt sold by the child to another user is kept in the system because the recipient now “owns” a copy of that article. Finally, user account history is retained to support subsequent customer service inquiries. All retained data for a closed account is private and visible only to employees of ROBLOX. 

We may store the date of birth of your child and graduate a player to have more Web site access once they turn 13\. We will notify the parent once their child has reached 13 and may prompt the child to then provide us with their email address the next time they sign into their account. If your child opts-in to receive our monthly newsletter we will send you a notice (to the email address your child provides for you). We will only collect your child’s email address for the sole purpose of sending them the newsletter. 

### Facebook Connect or other OpenID provider

If you are over 13 you can log in to our site using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personally identifiable information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on this Web site to your profile page to share with others within your network. 

####  Social Media Widgets 

Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button [and Widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site]. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it. 

##  Updating / Accessing / Amending / Correcting Personally Identifiable Information 

If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, amend, or deactivate it by making the change on our member information page (or by emailing our Customer Support at [info@roblox.com](mailto:info@roblox.com)) or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below. 

You have the right to review personally identifiable information collected from your child, and have that personally identifiable information deleted or refuse further collection and use of the personally identifiable information collected from your child by contacting us at the email address listed above. 

### Data Retention

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at [info@roblox.com](mailto:info@roblox.com). We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
