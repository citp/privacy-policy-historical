## About Roblox

Roblox is an imagination platform, where users are encouraged to design, create, and interact with whatever they can imagine. As a user of the Roblox platform, you and your friends can collaborate on building or just gather and explore other users' creations. Your privacy is important to us; this is why we created this Privacy Policy so that you are aware of what information is collected, how we use it and who we share it with. 

This privacy policy covers our websites on the roblox.com domain, our Roblox Mobile and Xbox Apps, and our other applications, websites, and services on which a link to this privacy policy is posted. This policy covers our practices with regard to users of all ages, including those under the age of 13. Please see the "Options for Parents" section below for more information about your rights as a parent or legal guardian of one of our users and the measures we take to comply with Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). To learn more about COPPA, you may consult this simple one-page informational guide form the kidSAFE Seal Program – [www.kidsafeseal.com/knowaboutcoppa.html](https://www.kidsafeseal.com/knowaboutcoppa.html). 

Please note that our Corporate Website (which is at corp.roblox.com and its subdomains) is a general audience website. On that site, we provide information regarding the corporate side of Roblox, press information, career information, and other general audience information. We may also ask for your name, email address and other information so that we can provide Roblox corporate related information to you. No game play happens on the Corporate Website. As such, the parts of this Privacy Policy that discuss game play or discuss users under 13 are not applicable to the Corporate Website. Roblox works like this: 

  * a user creates a username and a virtual character that is his or her identity in the Roblox world
  * users interact with other users through in-game chat, personal messaging (within the Roblox environment), and user forums, with privacy settings designed to allow users to restrict communications with other users
  * each user is given one or more pieces of virtual real estate on which they can build houses, cars, machines, roller coasters, or anything else you can imagine with building blocks and code; these places are called "games"
  * users search for, find, and play games made by other users; they play these games with other users from around the world, and are identified only by their username
  * the Roblox world includes a virtual currency known as ROBUX; users can earn or purchase ROBUX in a variety of ways, and use them to buy or sell items for their characters, for in-game items, and other uses
  * users who earn a large amount of ROBUX virtual currency are allowed to sell that currency back to Roblox subject to certain participation requirements, including being 13 years or older. See our DevEx Terms of Service at <http://www.roblox.com/developer-exchange/tos> if you want more information
  * users can purchase premium services, including monthly subscriptions
  * for more information on how our service works, please see our Terms of Service



## Requested Information

Roblox users may play as "guests"; in this mode, users remain anonymous and interact with the website and game but do not have access to the free chat, cannot use the personal messaging platform, cannot post to the forums, and are subject to other restrictions designed to prevent users from sharing personal information, whether intentionally or otherwise. As guests, users are unable to save play statistics, accumulate points, share models, or participate in the Roblox virtual economy. 

Users who want to save statistics, share models, and participate in the economy must create an account, including creating a username and password. Users should not create a username that reflects their own name or reveals personal information. Users should also not pick a password that is easy to guess, and should not share that password. For security reasons, we store passwords in encrypted form. 

Usernames are used for participating in site features and we do not use them to identify individual users outside of their activities on our sites and for purposes relating to offering our sites and services. Usernames are not passed along to third party companies except for our third party service providers who use or process the usernames for purposes relating to our sites and offerings, such as effectuating payments and website hosting. 

We request a user's birthdate, prior to creating an account to log in to our sites, so that we can try to provide a more age-appropriate experience for each of our users. 

All users may choose to add an email address to their account for added verification and to enable certain features. The primary purpose for this email address is account security, this email is our only way to verify the authenticity of the account owner. Users under the age of 13, however, may only provide us with a parent email address. Users may change their email address, and a notification will be sent to the previously provided email address upon making that change. 

Users purchase our virtual currency or premium subscriptions using a variety of payment methods. When using a credit card, users or their parents are required to enter billing information, including name, billing address, credit card or other payment information, and billing email. We retain certain billing information to support customer service inquiries, but we do not retain the full credit card numbers. 

Our mobile applications do not ask for permission to use, nor do they have access to, precise geolocation information (e.g., GPS or cellular network location) from your mobile device. 

## Collected Information

Roblox and our third party partners use cookies, beacons, tags and scripts and other similar technologies. These technologies are used to store users' preferences, analyze trends, administer the site, track users' entry onto and movements within the Roblox website, provide payment fraud protection, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and other internal Roblox operations. We also use this information to determine if new page designs are user friendly or too complicated. We use IP address and similar non-personal information such as browser type and date/time for determining how users interact with our website and services, and generally for the internal operation of our website. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies on an individual as well as aggregated basis. These technologies do not store personal information. For account security purposes, we may store a cookie that contains an encrypted user password. Users who disable cookies in their browsers may not be able to logon to the Roblox website or play the Roblox games. We may use third parties to provide these cookies and other tools. For instance, we use Google Analytics to collect and process certain analytics data. Google provides some additional privacy options described at <http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners> regarding Google Analytics cookies. Roblox does not process or respond to web browsers' “do not track” signals or other similar transmissions that indicate a request to disable online tracking of users who visit our websites or use our services or apps. 

We also collect performance data from within Roblox Studio and the Roblox Player. We use these usage statistics retrospectively to improve our user experience. This information may include networking activity, CPU load, and resource usage, among other relevant data. 

We use mobile analytics tools to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your device and to derive insights about how our mobile software is used. These tools may record information such as how often a user uses the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and from where the application was downloaded. We do not link this analytics information to any personal information about you. 

Roblox partners with third party advertisers, ad server companies, and ad networks that also use cookies, beacons, tags and scripts and other tracking technologies. For our users that are 13 years or older, these companies may use aggregated information about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you, often referred to as behaviorally targeted advertisements. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please visit [here ](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)and/or [here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/). Roblox does not show behaviorally targeted ads to our under 13 users. 

### Local Storage - HTML 5

We and third parties with whom we partner use Local Storage such as HTML 5 to store content and preferences. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing Local Storage such as HTML 5. 

### Log Files

Like many Web sites, we may gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information is used to provide technical and community support. This information may include a user's username, internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We do not link this automatically collected data to other information we request from you. 

Additionally, when visitors come to our site or apps, we may automatically collect some system information, such as the type of computer operating system (e.g., Windows or Mac OS), the web browser (e.g., Chrome, Internet Explorer) being used if applicable, the device type and identifier, IP address, and information regarding the Internet service provider. Although we do not collect precise geolocation data from mobile devices, a user's IP address may be used to estimate the general region a user is visiting is from. 

## Information Sharing

We will share personal information about you with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy or with your consent. We do not sell personal information about you to third parties. 

We pass user billing information on to our transaction processing and fraud prevention partners. This is done for non-anonymous payment types, including credit card and PayPal payments. For recurring monthly transactions, our payment processors retain payment information on file, but we do not. 

We share aggregated, automatically-collected, or otherwise non-personal information with third parties for various purposes, including (i) compliance with various reporting obligations; (ii) for business or marketing purposes; or (iii) to assist such parties in understanding our users' interests, habits, and usage patterns for certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality available through the Service. We do not share personal information about you in these cases. 

Some of our third-party service providers place cookies on our users to track the users' activities in order to provide Roblox with services, including user verification, customer support, chat monitoring and filtering, content delivery network services, and other internal operations. Third party services we currently partner with that may collect or maintain personal information include: 

  * Analytics Services: Google Inc, comScore
  * Moderation Services: Zendesk, CommunitySift
  * Billings Services: Kount, SiftScience, Paypal, Vantiv



If you have any inquiries regarding our partner's privacy practices or how they use personal information, please contact us directly at [info@roblox.com](mailto:info@roblox.com). 

We may disclose personal information about you as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we also may disclose personal information about you in response to law enforcement agencies or other public agencies (including schools or children services) request or if we feel that such disclosure may prevent the instigation of a crime, facilitate an investigation related to public safety or protect the safety of a child using our website, protect the security or integrity of our website, or enable us to take precautions against liability or to protect our rights. 

We offer users the ability to use forums and similar means of public discussion. If a user 13 years old or over uses any messaging, posting, or chat functions on Roblox, they should be aware that any personal information submitted there will be available to anyone who has access to that content, including other users, and can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for how other individuals use the information posted in this manner. 

Information about our users may be disclosed and otherwise transferred to an acquirer, successor, or assignee as part of any merger, acquisition, sale of assets, or similar transaction, or in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which information is transferred to one or more third parties as one of our business assets. 

## Security & Data Retention

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card numbers) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL) or similar technologies. 

We use reasonable measures intended to protect the personal or other sensitive information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

Roblox retains account data internally for three purposes: (i) billing information and transaction histories are retained to resolve subsequent billing disputes and inquiries; (ii) public domain content is retained for use by the community (e.g. a virtual shirt sold by the child to another user is kept in the system because the recipient now “owns” a copy of that article); and (iii) user account history is retained to support subsequent customer service inquiries. 

## Children's Privacy

Registered users who are under 13 years old interact with the Roblox world in what we call "Privacy Mode." Privacy Mode limits who may interact with a user outside of games and limits the user to a whitelist-filtered language system for making posts in all public and comment areas of the site. If a user under the age of 13 uses our messaging, posting, or chat functions, these features are filtered and/or moderated so that users are prevented from posting personal information about themselves. 

We proactively filter the site to remove references to addresses, emails, phone numbers, and other personal information regardless of security and privacy settings. All text is also filtered for profanity, phishing, and adult or suggestive content. Our system is a combination of human and automated processes; like all filtering technology, our systems are not 100% effective. 

## Options for Parents

When a child adds a parent's email address to their account, the parent receives an email notification of the account creation and an invitation to review and/or update settings for the child's account. To make any requests for changes to your child's account or requests for the removal of personal information about you or your child from our services or that we stop the further collection or use (as applicable) of your or your child's personal information, contact us at [info@roblox.com](mailto:info@roblox.com). If a parent closes a child's account by contacting Roblox customer service at [info@roblox.com](mailto:info@roblox.com), this hides the account from all other Roblox users and outside parties. 

We may use the birthdate a child used when signing up for our site to “graduate” him/her to have broader access to features on our sites when that user turns 13 years old. If we do so, we will attempt to notify the parent (by notifying the email address on file) prior to graduation and give them information on the change and what to do if they do not want this graduation to occur. We will also notify the user in advance through a message on the site. 

## Social Media

### Facebook Connect or other OpenID provider

Visitors may log in to our site using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or another Open ID provider if they are over the age of 13. We use these services to authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form. 

### Social Media Widgets

For our registered users above the age of 13, our sites include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button and the Share widget. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the feature. 

## Changing Personal Information

If personal information about you changes, or if you no longer desire to use our service, you may correct, update, amend, or deactivate your account by making the change on our member information page (or by emailing our Customer Support at [info@roblox.com](mailto:info@roblox.com) or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe. 

## International Transfer

We operate globally and we may transfer information we collect internationally. In particular, information provided to us or collected by us likely will be transferred to and processed in the United States by us, our agents or contractors. Our privacy practices are guided by data privacy laws in the United States. The data protection laws of the United States or other countries may not be as comprehensive or equivalent to those in our visitor's country of residence. By using Roblox, visitors consent to the collection, international transfer, storage, and processing of their information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. 

## Privacy Policy Changes and Updates

We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes to our information practices at any time, so please review it frequently. If we update this policy, changes will be reflected on this page and we will update the “Last Updated” date posted above. If we make any material changes to this privacy policy, we will attempt to notify you by email (by sending an email to the email address specified in your account, if an email account is associated with your account) or by means of a prominent notice on this website prior to the change becoming effective. We will obtain parental consent for any changes we make if those changes affect users under the age of 13 in a way that requires parental consent under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.
