**Robb Report Media, LLC**

**Online Privacy Policy**  (including California Privacy Rights) 

_This Privacy Policy was last modified and is_ _effective as of July 6, 2016._

This Online Privacy Policy provides guidelines concerning how  Robb Report Media, LLC (“Robb Report"), gathers and uses personally identifiable information you provide only to us (as compared to publically available postings) as part of your interaction with all of Robb Report’s digital properties, including Robb Report’s Website(s) and other related digital products. 

Our official Privacy Policy forms part of your legal agreement with us under our [TERMS and CONDITIONS](file:///C:/Users/AnthonyA/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.Outlook/NJ1OLZOX/TERMS%20&%20CONDITIONS).  Please read our Privacy Policy carefully in conjunction with our Terms and Conditions to be sure you understand:  1) how we collect and use information and under what circumstances we share information about you; and 2) the terms and conditions of your use of our website and related digital properties, including, but not limited to, RobbReport.com and other related international websites, iPad, iPhone and other digital applications.

In the event that you have any questions or concerns about the guidelines included in the Online Privacy Policy or how we use information which you have given us or which has been derived from your use of our Website(s) and other digital applications, please contact us at [privacypolicy](mailto:PrivacyPolicy@CurtCo.com)[@robbreport.com](mailto:PrivacyPolicy@CurtCo.com).

Any terms not defined in this Privacy Policy are defined in our [TERMS and CONDITIONS](file:///C:/Users/AnthonyA/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.Outlook/NJ1OLZOX/TERMS%20&%20CONDITIONS).

**MODIFICATION OF THE PRIVACY POLICY**

We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify, add or delete provisions of our Online Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time, and we will prominently post a notice and the effective date of any change on our Website.  If you have given us your email address to use or we have some other means of contacting you, we also may attempt to notify you about changes to the Policy in any or all of those ways. However, our online posting will be the only official and required notice you will receive of changes to the Policy.

Your use of our Website(s) and/or other digital applications after the effective date of any change to our Online Privacy Policy means you accept and agree to be bound by the Privacy Policy, as modified. We urge you to come back to this web page and review this Privacy Policy regularly so that you remain aware of the terms and conditions that apply to you. 

In any event, changes to our Online Privacy Policy may affect our use of personal information you have provided to us prior to our notification to you of the changes.  If you do not wish to permit changes in our use of your information, you must notify us prior to the effective date of the changes that you wish to deactivate your account with us.

**COLLECTING PERSONAL INFORMATION**

"Personal Information" means any information obtained through your use of our Website(s) and other digital products that might reasonably be used to specifically identify you, such as your name, title, company, address, email, and phone number, among other things. The Personal Information we collect from you is provided by you voluntarily and enables us to give you access to specific products, including our newsletters, all of which may include features, functions, promotions, products and services associated with our digital applications.  You can choose not to provide this information, but then you might not have access to such products and services.

We do not sell or rent your Personal Information to others. If necessary, our Website(s) may collect payment and payment instrument information from you for the purpose of billing you for products and services you purchase through our Website(s). Bear in mind, as noted in the section below entitled  **Advertisers, Sponsors and Links to Others** , if you leave our Website(s) and go to another website, whether by clicking on or selecting an advertisement, re-directing your browser, or otherwise, the terms and conditions, privacy and other policies and practices of the website to which you have been directed will apply, NOT ours. If you elect to use our ‘Send to a Friend’ function in order to tell someone else about us, we will ask you to provide your email address and the email address of the individual you wish to inform. We will use this information to send a one-time automated email inviting them to visit our Website(s) and/or receive our newsletters and/or access our products and to advise them that the invitation arose from your request.  We will not retain the information obtained in this manner for longer than is necessary to transmit and confirm the email, and we will not use it for any other purpose.

**COLLECTING NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION**

When you use our Website(s), we often use third party operational service providers (see  **Disclosure to Third Parties**  below) and technology that can recognize, collect and transmit information that is associated with you or your computer and browser, but which does not personally identify you (“Non-Personal Information”).

Our Website(s) also may use “cookies” to collect Non-Personal Information about you. The term "cookie" commonly is used to refer to a small text file stored on a computer that keeps track of your visits to web sites and/or can contain log-in information so you don’t have to re-enter information each time you visit.  We will use the term "cookie" to refer generically to any technology that can recognize, collect or transmit information about your visits to our Website(s).

"Cookie" information typically includes such Non-Personal Information or data as the Internet or web domain that referred you, the type of operating system and browser you are using, the date and time of your visit, information relating to your activities on our Website(s) (e.g. ‘clickstream’ data), and other technical attributes of your visits to our Website(s). Cookies store information that allows our Website(s) to recognize a user’s computer or access device each time it is used to visit our Website(s). Cookies also can keep count of how often you return to our Website(s). Additionally, cookies can track how you use our Website(s), such as your preferences for features and functions, and can store information such as your log-in information, so you don’t have to re-enter them each time you return to our Website(s). We use the information collected through cookies to analyze trends, administer our Website(s), track movements on our Website(s) and gather aggregate demographic information about all of our visitors so that we can continually improve our Website(s). We do not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer for purposes that are unrelated to our Website(s) or your interaction with our Website(s).

You may stop or restrict cookies on your computer or purge them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences.  You should consult the operating instructions that apply to your browser to obtain instructions, should you decide to change the use of cookies on your computer or purge them from your browser, and, in general, to determine how best to configure your browser settings to meet your requirements.

Note that if you ‘turn off,’ purge or disable cookies, you may not be able to use all of the features, functions or services available on our Website(s).

**Additionally, we may engage a data provider who may collect web log data from you (including IP address and information about your browser or operating system), or place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to enable you to receive customized ads or content from the web, mobile or other media channels.   These cookies contain no personally identifiable information.  The cookies may reflect de-identifiable demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g. your email address) that we may share with a data provider solely in hashed, non-human, readable form.  Please visit **<http://www.aboutads.info/choices>**or**[http://networkadvertising/choices](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices) **to opt out of these data provider cookies.**

**HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION**

We may use information we collect about you when you visit our web properties and use our products to:

  * Send you administrative communications about your interactions with us or about features of our website, including any future changes to this Online Privacy Statement; 
  * Improve your experience with our Website(s) and products by using information we collect in combination with third-party information to inform, optimize, and provide relevant, related, and contextual advertising and content; and 
  * Send you promotional materials about goods and services either offered by us or third-parties (see  **Disclosure to Third Parties**  below).  ‘Promotional materials’ means communications that directly promote the use of our Website(s) and products, or the purchase of products and offerings). 



We also may share your information with third parties when you engage in certain activities on our Website(s) or product offerings that are sponsored or co-sponsored by third parties (see  **Disclosure to Third Parties**  below).

If, at any time in the future, we decide we are going to use your Personal Information in a way that differs from our then current Privacy Policy, we will provide notice as described in the section above entitled  **We Can Modify This Privacy Policy** , at least 30 days’ in advance of the proposed change.

**ADVERTISERS, CO-SPONSORS AND LINKS TO OTHERS**

Our Websites and products may contain or display information from sponsors, co-sponsors, advertisers, or others that offer to make information, products and/or services available, provide opportunities to participate in promotions or engage in activities, or link or redirect your browser to other websites, web pages, materials or organizations. We also may use “Operational Service Providers” - third parties who administer, operate, and configure our Website(s), maintain and provide internal support for our Websites and content on our Websites, display and provide advertising on our Website(s), and distribute our online, email, or web-based newsletters and other information.  You may encounter or see on our Website(s) the advertising, links or references to third parties or any of their websites, including any cookies or other technology they may use.  Such third parties are not under our control; they have their own terms, conditions, policies and practices that apply to you in connection with their websites, services, and offerings, including those concerning collection, use and disclosure of your information (including Personal Information).

Some of our products, such as live events, educational events, conferences, newsletters, discussion groups, social applications, and membership-based products may be co-sponsored in conjunction with other companies that also are not under our control. Whenever we are involved in the provision of these kinds of services, we will disclose the name of our co-sponsor and, to the extent they are website-based.  Co-sponsors of these products also are not under our control.  When you participate, register or engage in other online activities related to these co-sponsored products, you should be aware that you are providing your information, which may include Personal Information, to us and the co-sponsor and that the co-sponsor’s policies, practices, terms and conditions, not ours, apply to their collection and use of both your Personal and Non-Personal Information.

We encourage you to be aware that when you leave our Website(s) to take advantage of advertised offers, links or other references, you or your internet browser may be directed to the websites or web pages of another party.  Once you leave our Website(s), we are not responsible for any of the terms or conditions, privacy practices and content of other entities’ websites or the functions, features, activities or transactions you may engage in on other entities’ websites.

**DISCLOSURE TO THIRD PARTIES**

We always have the right to disclose your Personal Information to the Operational Service Providers we engage to assist us in connection with our Website(s) or other services we provide. We always ask our Operational Service Providers to protect your privacy and to not disclose your Personal Information to any third party marketers that are not associated with our Website(s).  Our Operational Service Providers also are not permitted to use your Personal Information for their own marketing or promotional purposes.  If we use an Operational Service Provider to provide advertising when you visit our Website(s), then they may use information about your visit to our Website(s) to provide advertisements about products and services that may be of interest to you.

In the course of providing advertisements to our Website(s), our Operational Service Providers may use cookies. If you would like more information about this practice and about your ability to choose not to have this information used by the Operational Service Provider we use for this service, please click here:  <http://privacy.aol.com/> and <https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/> and [_http://sailthru.com/legal/#pri_ _vacy-statement_](http://sailthru.com/legal/#privacy-statement).

We also currently use an Operational Service Provider to measure our Website traffic. They also may have access to Non-Personal Information (but not Personal Information) about your use of our Website(s) to help us improve our Website(s). If you would like more information about how the Operational Service Provider we use for this service collects and uses this information, please visit: <http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/> and <http://www.adobe.com/privacy/policy.html>.

We also reserve the right to make your Personal Information available:

  * When compelled by a governmental agency, law, regulation, a court or other legal process; 
  * If we believe you are, have or may violate any law or regulation or our [TERMS and CONDITIONS](file:///C:/Users/AnthonyA/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.Outlook/NJ1OLZOX/TERMS%20&%20CONDITIONS); 
  * If we believe you are or may be a threat to safety, security, property, interests or rights of us or anyone else; 
  * In order to investigate, respond to or resolve problems or inquiries or protect, enforce or defend our rights, assets and/or interests; and 
  * In a merger, acquisition, change of control, joint venture or other business combination. 



**OPTING OUT**

If you register to receive our newsletter(s) on our Website(s), you are agreeing and consenting to receive information and updates about your use of our Website(s), services, and products for which you register. You may ‘unsubscribe’ to receiving our newsletter(s) by updating your contact preferences.

**SECURITY**

The Internet is an international public network of networks, and we cannot guarantee that communications between you and us or between you and others to, through or from our Website(s) and/or other digital applications will be free from unauthorized access or interference by third parties, such as hackers.  By using our Website(s) and other digital applications, you are agreeing to assume this risk and any and all responsibility and liability that may arise. Nonetheless, the security and confidentiality of your Personal Information is extremely important to us. We have put in place reasonable physical, electronic and operational security measures to safeguard your information, and we limit access to your Personal Information to only those employees who need access in order to perform their duties. When possible, we also attempt to provide secure transmissions by using encryption technologies.  From time to time, we review our security procedures and consider the use of appropriate new technology and methods.  Please be aware, though that, despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.

**YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

We will provide you with a mechanism to allow and enable you to correct or update the Personal Information in our records that we have obtained from you.  You always can review and change your Personal Information by contacting us by email at PrivacyPolicy@RobbReport.com or by telephone at (310) 589-7700, or by clicking the link to the Mailing Preference Center located at the bottom of each email we send you and following the instructions on that page. Certain Personal Information may not be changed without authentication.  Therefore, you may be asked to provide additional information to allow us to confirm your identity in order to change that Information.  If you ask us to remove your Personal Information, we still reserve the right to retain as much of your Personal Information and for so long as necessary to comply with our legal, regulatory, internal audit and record-keeping requirements.
