# Privacy Policy | RobbReport

|   
We at CurtCo Robb Media, LLC, publisher of Robb Report and The Robb Report Collection, want to let you know to what extent we are currently collecting information on you when you visit this Site and how we use such information. This may change as we continue to develop the Site to include additional features. If so, we will revise this Privacy Statement to let you know of those changes. 

**Personal Information**

At this time, we collect certain personal information from you, but only through your voluntary participation in contests and sweepstakes (and sometimes in surveys, unless we tell you that your responses will be anonymous). Such information can include your name, age, gender, address, email address, user name, telephone number, and certain other information that we specifically request in the entry form. However, participation in these surveys, contests and sweepstakes, and giving us this information, is entirely up to you.

 We may use the above-described information ("Personal Information") to personalize and enhance your use of this Site, such as by delivering more relevant advertisements and content to you. We may also use your Personal Information to communicate with you on a one-time basis, such as to respond to your inquiries or comments or notify you that you have won one of our sweepstakes or contests. Your use of this Web site constitutes your permission to CurtCo Robb Media to use your Personal Information for such purposes.

We may also want to offer you products, programs and services by sending you email or otherwise contacting you through use of your Personal Information. If you do not wish to be contacted by us for such promotional purposes, you may "opt out" by emailing us at privacypolicy@robbreport.com with that request.

Sometimes we share your Personal Information with reputable organizations whose products or services we think you might find interesting. This will not be done without first obtaining your consent. While we seek to share Personal Information with companies and organizations that follow appropriate privacy policies, we cannot be responsible for the actions of such third parties. However, if you wish that we not share your Personal Information, you may "opt out" by emailing us at privacypolicy@robbreport.com with that request. We will not share your Personal Information with any third parties (except as may be required by law) if you have "opted out" in the above-described manner.

 **Other Data Collection**

We may engage third party ad servers to serve the advertisements that appear on this Site, which may themselves collect certain information on you when you view or click on an advertisement on this Site. While we try to enter into business relationships only with companies that have similar privacy practices to CurtCo Robb Media's privacy policy, we do not have control over, and therefore are not responsible for, the information-collecting practices of these third parties. Our Web server automatically collects certain information about our visitors' traffic patterns that it provides to us in the aggregate. We cannot identify individual visitors from this information. We only use this information to monitor the user traffic levels of this Site, and we disclose such information to third party advertisers and other business associates in the same aggregate form.

 **Questions?**

If you have a question about this Privacy Statement, please contact us at privacypolicy@robbreport.com.
