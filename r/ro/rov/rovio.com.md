Rovio may use and disclose to Rovio’s partners and contractors the collected non-personal data for purposes of analyzing usage of the Services, advertisement serving, managing and providing the Services and to further develop the Services and other Rovio services and products.

You recognize and agree that the analytics companies utilized by Rovio may combine the information collected with other information they have independently collected from other services or products relating to your activities. These companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies.

**Ad Serving Technology**

Rovio reserves the right to use and disclose the collected non-personal data for purposes of advertisement by Rovio or Rovio’s partners and contractors. Rovio may employ third party ad serving technologies that use certain methods to collect information as a result of ad serving through Services. Rovio or third parties operating the ad serving technology may use demographic and location information as well as information logged from your hardware or device to ensure that appropriate advertising is presented within the Service.

The foregoing data may be used and disclosed in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the privacy policy of the company providing the ad serving technology.

You recognize and agree that the advertising companies who deliver ads for Rovio may combine the information collected with other information they have independently collected from other services or products. These companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies. These ad serving technologies are integrated into Services; if you do not want to be subject to this technology, do not use or access Services. Although Rovio takes commercially reasonable steps to instruct such advertising companies to comply with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, Rovio does not have access to or control of third party technologies.

**Personal Data**

For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “personal data” means personally identifiable information that specifically identifies you as an individual.

Likely situations when you make personal data available to Rovio include, but are not limited to: (i) registration for Services, contests and special events; (ii) accessing Services using a third party ID, such as social networking sites or gaming services; (iii) subscribing to newsletters; (iv) purchasing a product or services through Rovio’s online stores; (v) using “tell a friend,” "email this page," or other similar features; (vi) requesting technical support; and (vii) otherwise through use of Rovio Services where personal data is required for use and/or participation.

If you choose to use Rovio’s "tell a friend" or a similar service about Rovio Services or order a gift certificate for your friend, Rovio will store your friend's name and contact details that you provide to Rovio.

Rovio may use collected personal data for purposes of analyzing usage of the Services, providing customer and technical support, managing and providing Services (including managing advertisement serving) and to further develop the Services and other Rovio services and products.

Please note that certain features of the Services may be able to connect to your social networking sites to obtain additional information about you.  In such cases, Rovio may be able to collect certain information from your social networking profile when your social networking site permits it, and when you consent to allow your social networking site to make that information available to Rovio.  This information may include, but is not limited to, your name, profile picture, gender, user ID, email address, your country, your language, your time zone, the organizations and links on your profile page, the names and profile pictures of your social networking site “friends” and other information you have included in your social networking site profile.

Personal data may, however, occasionally be disclosed in accordance with applicable legislation and this Privacy Policy. Additionally, Rovio may disclose personal data to its parent companies and its subsidiaries in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Rovio may hire agents and contractors to collect and process personal data on Rovio’s behalf and in such cases such agents and contractors will be instructed to comply with our Privacy Policy and to use personal data only for the purposes for which the third party has been engaged by Rovio. These agents and contractors may not use your personal data for their own marketing purposes. Rovio may use third party service providers such as credit card processors, e-mail service providers, shipping agents, data analyzers and business intelligence providers. Rovio has the right to share your personal data as necessary for the aforementioned third parties to provide their services for Rovio. Rovio is not liable for the acts and omissions of these third parties, except as provided by mandatory law.

Rovio may disclose your personal data to third parties as required by law enforcement or other government officials in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or Rovio to legal liability. Rovio may also disclose your personal data to third parties when Rovio has a reason to believe that a disclosure is necessary to address potential or actual injury or interference with Rovio’s rights, property, operations, users or others who may be harmed or may suffer loss or damage, or Rovio believes that such disclosure is necessary to protect Rovio’s rights, combat fraud and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on Rovio. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Rovio will make reasonable efforts to notify you of such disclosure through Rovio’s website or in another reasonable manner.

**Data Retention and Correctness**

Rovio retains the data collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. Thereafter if the collected data is no longer needed for purposes specified in this Privacy Policy, Rovio deletes all aforementioned data in its possession within a reasonable timeframe. Rovio does not verify the correctness of personal data.

Rovio may still retain some of the data to the extent such retention is necessary to resolve disputes, enforce Rovio user agreements, and comply with technical and legal requirements and constraints related to the security, integrity and operation of Services.

**Cookies, beacons and tracking**

The Services may use “cookies” and other technologies such as pixel tags, clear GIFs and web beacons. Rovio treats information collected by cookies and similar technologies as non-personal data.

E-mails and other electronic communications Rovio sends to you may contain code that enables Rovio to track your usage of the communication, including whether the communication was opened and/or what links were followed (if any). Rovio may combine that information to other information Rovio has about you and Rovio may use that information to improve the Services and/or provide customized communications to you.

**Third Party Terms and Conditions**

Please note that your access to and use of the Services may be subject to certain third party terms and conditions and privacy policies, including but not limited to application stores, mobile software platforms, on-line gaming platforms, social networking services and payment providers. You recognize and agree that Rovio is not liable for any such third party terms and conditions and their use of your personal data.

Rovio follows generally accepted industry standards and maintains reasonable safeguards to attempt to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of the information in Rovio’s possession. Only those persons with a need to process your personal data in connection with the fulfillment of their tasks in accordance with the purposes of this Privacy Policy and for the purposes of performing technical maintenance, have access to your personal data in Rovio’s possession. Personal data collected by Rovio is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public. To prevent unauthorized on-line access to personal data, Rovio maintains personal data behind a firewall-protected server. However, no system can be 100% secure and there is the possibility that despite Rovio’s reasonable efforts, there could be unauthorized access to your personal data. By using the Services, you assume this risk.
