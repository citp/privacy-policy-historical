[Previous versions: [April 6, 2018](https://web.archive.org/privacy/04-06-2018/); [January 25, 2018](https://web.archive.org/privacy/01-25-2018/); [December 1, 2017](https://web.archive.org/privacy/12-01-2017/); March 28, 2014; April 20, 2012; November 14th, 2011; July 21, 2011] 

This Privacy Statement explains how information about you is collected, used and disclosed by A Place for Rover, Inc. and our affiliate Rover Europe GmbH (collectively, “Rover,” “we” or “us”). This Privacy Statement applies to information we collect when you use our websites, mobile applications and other online products and services (collectively, the “Services”) or when you otherwise interact with us. This Privacy Statement does not apply to websites, applications, or services that display or link to different privacy statements. 

We may change this Privacy Statement from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the Privacy Statement. If we make material changes to this statement, we will provide you with notice or obtain consent regarding such changes as may be required by applicable law. We encourage you to review the Privacy Statement whenever you access the Services or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Privacy Statement have the meanings given to them in the Terms of Service applicable to your location. 

#### Collection of Information

Information we collect depends on how you interact with us, the Services you use, and the choices you make. We collect and process information about you with your consent and/or as necessary to provide the products and services you use, operate our business, meet our contractual and legal obligations, protect the security of our systems and our customers, or fulfil other legitimate interests. 

We collect information about you in various ways when you use our Services, including information you provide directly, information collected automatically, and third-party data sources. 

##### Information You Provide to Us

We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we collect information when you create an account, post or reserve a listing, make a payment, write a review, communicate with other users through our Services or participate in any other interactive features of the Services. We also collect information when you participate in a contest, promotion or survey, apply for a job, communicate with us via third party social media sites, request customer support, or otherwise communicate with us. The types of information we may collect include basic user information (such as your name, email address, postal address, phone number, photos, gender, and date of birth); pet information (such as breed, age, photos, veterinarian, and immunization status); tax information (including social security or other tax identification number for Service Providers) and any other information you choose to provide (including the content of any communications you send and receive through the Services). 

We may also collect and store limited payment information from you, such as payment card type, expiration date and a portion of your payment card number; however, we do not store or have access to full payment card numbers as all transactions are processed by our third-party payment processors. If you are a Service Provider, we and our third-party payment processors may also collect certain payment disbursement information to pay you for the Pet Care Services you provide via the Rover Service. 

If you are a Service Provider, we and our third-party service providers may also collect certain personal information from you for purposes of verifying your identity or conducting a background check. In the U.S., in addition to the information we collect to set up your account, our third-party service provider collects your social security number in order to conduct a background check. In the U.K., in addition to the information we collect to set up your account, our third-party service provider collects your photo and an image of your passport, government identity card, or driver’s license in order to verify your identity. 

In some cases, we may also collect information you provide about others, such as when you send an email to one of your personal contacts using our Services. In such case, we will use this information solely to fulfill your request, and not to otherwise send promotional communications to those contacts. 

When you are asked to provide information, you may decline. But if you choose not to provide information that is necessary for certain products or features, those products or features may not be available or function correctly.

Your use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature. For more information about the purpose and scope of information collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the entities that provide these features. 

#### Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others

We may allow others to provide analytics services and/or serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet. These entities may use Cookies to collect information about your use of our websites and third-party websites. To learn more about how these third parties use Cookies and how to manage your preferences, please read our [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/tos/cookies/). Note that if you opt-out of third-party advertising Cookies, you will still see online ads, but they will not be personalized. 

#### Security

Rover takes reasonable measures designed to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration and destruction. 

#### Transfer and Location of Information

The information we collect may be stored and processed in your region, in the United States, or in any other country where we or our affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers maintain facilities. The processing locations are chosen in order to operate efficiently, to improve performance, and to create redundancies in order to protect information in the event of an outage or other problem. We take steps designed to ensure that the information we collect under this statement is processed according to the provisions of this statement and applicable law wherever the information is located. 

We transfer information from the European Economic Area and Switzerland to other countries, some of which have not been determined by the European Commission to have an adequate level of data protection. When we do so, we use a variety of legal mechanisms, including contracts, to help ensure your rights and protections. To learn more about the European Commission’s decisions on the adequacy of information protections, please click [here](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en). 

#### Retention of Information

We retain information for as long as necessary to provide the products and fulfill the transactions you have requested, or for other essential purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. Because these needs can vary for different information types in the context of different products, actual retention periods can vary significantly based on criteria such as user expectations or consent, the sensitivity of the information, the availability of automated controls that enable users to delete information, and our legal or contractual obligations.
