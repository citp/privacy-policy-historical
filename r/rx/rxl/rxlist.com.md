About RxList ®

Frequently Asked Questions:

Q.  Why does your RxList search find drug names I was not looking for?  
A.  The search uses 'fuzzy' logic and attempts to match patterns similar to your input assuming you may not know how to spell the drug name you're searching for. If you are certain of your spelling, an asterisk (*) placed in the search string (such as prozac*) will turn off the fuzzy logic feature and the search will perform exact pattern matches only. If you type in the first few letters of a drug name without the asterisk (*) the search will match any brand or generic drug that matches that pattern and will also provide fuzzy results to increase the chances of finding your drug on the very first search.

Q.  I am no longer able to see the "Side Effects" tab. Why is this? That is the section I use the most often.  


A.  You are probably using Norton Internet Security which conflicts with certain features of this site and is blocking your ability to view and click the navigation tabs of RxList Monographs (Description, Clinical Pharmacology, Indications and Dosage, Side Effects / Drug Interactions, Warnings Precautions, Overdose Contraindications, and Patient Information). Please click [ HERE ](http://www.rxlist.com/norton.htm) for more information. If you disable Norton, the problem should go away.  


Q. I went to your advanced search page and found several different search boxes, what's the difference?  


A.  Let's list and describe the 5 searches found on the [advanced search](https://web.archive.org/web/20031205004948id_/http%3A//rxlist.com/interact.htm) page:  


  * RxList Search: Search the RxList database for brand name, generic name and pharmacologic category. Many of the most popular entries have links to professional and/or patient oriented material.
  * Keyword Search: Search the body of the professional monographs and the RxList Alternatives content for keywords such as interactions, side effects, foreign brand names, etc.
  * RxList-ID (Imprint) Search:  Many tablets and capsules have alphanumeric characters printed on them for identification. Use this search to identify by the characters printed (imprint codes) on tablets and capsules.
  * Drug FAQ's/Patient monographs: Use this search to find drug information written in plain English.  
  * Search Medical Dictionary: RxList offers the full Taber's Medical Encyclopedia of more than 55,000 medical terms.   




Q.  How can I check to see if all my medications are safe to take together?  


A.  You can look each product up individually in RxList and read the Drug Interaction sections for each, if available. The Keyword search is handy for checking interactions by entering multiple drug names into the search.
