Revised January, 2004  
Policy-Procedure  
Supercedes version dated January, 2002

**Purpose**  
To develop within the University community an appreciation for the value, and often vulnerable nature of the information asset and to reduce the risk of misuse, destruction or loss of information without restricting academic freedom or complicating access to information for which the University community has a legitimate and specific need.

**Application and Scope**  
This policy extends to the whole of the University community. It directs that the information be used in a manner that maintains an appropriate level of confidentiality and that provides sufficient assurance of its integrity in compliance with existing laws and obligations. While the elimination of all risk is impossible, the goal of the policy is to minimize the possibility of information misuse, corruption, and loss through the adoption of reasonable procedures for the University community to follow.

While this policy is especially pertinent to information stored electronically, it is also intended to guide users of all information, including that which is stored in other formats, such as paper, microfilm, and video, as well as the content of confidential meetings and conversations.

  


### POLICY

### Access Guidelines

  1. **Freedom of Information and Privacy Protection:** Ryerson's Board of Governors has approved the Council of Ontario Universities (COU) guidelines with respect to information access and protection of privacy for application within the community. Refer to Freedom of Information and Privacy Protection Guidelines. Please ask your director, chair, manager, or supervisor to see a copy of the Guidelines.
  2. **Public Information:** The vast majority of information at the University is of a public nature, for example: telephone directories, calendars, schedules, library books in general circulation, most conversations and meetings, and information bulletins. Access to public information is limited by such restrictions as circulation policies, copyright restrictions, license and contractual agreements, University policies, (such as the Student Information: Collection, Dissemination and Confidentiality), and procedures for use.
  3. **Restricted Information:** Information of a restricted or legally constrained nature, such as that protected by federal and provincial laws on rights and privacy, should only be accessed by those authorized members of the University community with a specific and legitimate need. Legitimate access does not include the freedom to search for information beyond that specifically required to perform a job-related task or authorized research.

  


### Usage Guidelines

  1. Each member of the University community will be accountable for appropriate use of the information asset as it pertains to his/her work assignment, the terms of this policy, and the procedures established for this purpose in the member's work area.
  2. Appropriate use is defined as wise and prudent use of information so that resources are not wasted, damaged, or corrupted. Inappropriate use includes erasing or modifying information without proper authorization, defacing or removing pages from books, using information to embarrass, intimidate or harass, or attempting to subvert the flow of information, such as purposefully attempting to crash or slow down computer systems, modifying or removing posted information without authority, and other such actions.
  3. Authorized research is defined as respecting the defined boundaries of permitted research areas.

  


### Responsibilities

  1. **Department:** Each user department responsible for University information shall maximize the likelihood information is being used properly and appropriately by:  

    1. identifying the information it maintains;
    2. determining whether it is of a restricted nature;
    3. developing, implementing, and maintaining reasonable and clear procedures that:
      * establish access rules;
      * identify change control requirements and responsibilities;
      * identify confidentiality requirements;
      * promote "good housekeeping" practices such as locking away confidential files when not in use, destroying confidential information when discarded, and not sharing passwords to computer accounts with anyone other than their supervisor and/or the department information security officer;
      * establish appropriate password, data integrity, storage, backup, and recovery practices where local department computer applications exist;
    4. having employees sign an acknowledgement that they are aware of this policy and the related departmental procedures, and that they are expected to act appropriately in maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of the information to which they have access.
