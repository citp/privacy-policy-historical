When you are in a secure area of the website, such as the checkout screens, you should see a solid padlock in your browser status bar which indicates that the encryption is taking place. 

You will also see that the Ryman address in the browser has changed and the http has been replaced with https in front of the www.ryman.co.uk address.

 **Credit card fraud prevention**

Ryman have recently introduced additional security in the way that your credit card is processed. 

‘Verified by Visa’ and ‘MasterCard SecureCode’ are services that are provided directly by the bank or organisation that issued your card and you need to be registered with them to take advantage of this additional security. 

Once you are registered you will be prompted to enter 3 digits from your private password during the payment screen of the checkout process. 

Please note: This is not your Ryman.co.uk login password. If you do not know or have forgotten your Verified by Visa and MasterCard SecureCode

 **Phishing emails or calls – do not share your personal information**

Phishing is the process of tricking someone into passing over personal or sensitive information. This can be done in an email format or through a phone call from someone pretending to be from an official and legitimate source. 

Do not share your personal information with anyone claiming to be from Ryman. If we need to take an alternative payment method or other personal information from you, we will ask you to call us back on our main customer services number. 

If you think someone is attempting to deceive you into passing over your details, please let us know immediately.
