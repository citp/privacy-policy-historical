## Credit card fraud prevention

Ryman have recently introduced additional security in the way that your credit card is processed.   
‘Verified by Visa’ and ‘MasterCard SecureCode’ are services that are provided directly by the bank or organisation that issued your card and you need to be registered with them to take advantage of this additional security.   
Once you are registered you will be prompted to enter 3 digits from your private password during the payment screen of the checkout process.   
Please note: This is not your Ryman.co.uk login password. If you do not know or have forgotten your Verified by Visa and MasterCard SecureCode
