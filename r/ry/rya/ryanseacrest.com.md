About Children's Privacy**

This is the place in cyberspace where fans of Ryan Seacrest can come to find out more about Ryan. In compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we do not knowingly collect from children under age 13 personally identifiable information (information that would allow anyone to locate children under age 13 online or offline, such as full name, email address, home address, telephone number, etc.). Therefore, children under age 13 may not provide any personally identifiable information on this site. However, they can still enjoy our site by viewing the photo galleries, reading about Ryan and other performers, listening to music and participating in other activities that do not require the disclosure of personally identifiable information.

 _1.1. General._ RSP collects personal identifiable information (“PII”) such as your full name, email address, mailing address and telephone number only in order to create or enhance our relationship with you.

Where possible, we try to indicate which fields of information are required and which are optional. You always have the option to not provide information by choosing not to use a particular service or feature. On those occasions when we obtain PII from a third party, we only use reputable sources of information. **** _1.2.
