### Introduction

At Rydoo, we understand the needs of privacy and safety. We consider our travelers’ trust as one of our most valuable assets. Therefore, we want to do the utmost for your data to ensure it’s safe with us.

This document describes how we collect and use the data concerning the use of our services. We keep it simple and easy to understand, as our company has been built on openness and our services on trust. Here you will also find our contact information in case you would need any further assistance.

Rydoo N.V. and iAlbatros Poland Sp.Zo.o and their local subsidiaries provide business process outsourcing services in the areas of travel and expense management using modern technology solutions.

Our expense management services allow the client to capture, track and store his business expenditure receipts, as well as to generate and submit for approval the expense reports derived from those receipts, which are uploaded via either web, e-mail and/or mobile applications.

Our travel management services allow the client to use our web pages, mobile applications, call center, integrated partner applications, instant messaging and social media platforms. This policy applies to all the platforms you can use to get access to our services and all the data we collect using those platforms.

This policy may change when the applicable legislation changes or if we decide to extend our services. Please visit this page regularly to be kept up-to-date.

If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, we kindly advise you to stop using our services.

### What kind of information we collect

##### Information provided by you or your employer

Depending on the services you or your employer has selected, we collect some specific information about you.

To provide you with the best available accommodation, flight or rail ticket we need to know certain things about you, like your first name, last name, ID document number, contact details, other travelers’ data; sometimes also your date of birth can be asked, in order to process the booking.

In order to perform our expense management services, we may also receive and store the following information about you: your bank account number, scanned expense receipts and credit card statements, which may include personal data such as name, address and bank account information.

Use of our services does not always require users to fill in or upload sensitive personal data. In order to avoid unnecessary exposure, we ask you to make sure that sensitive personal data are not filled in or uploaded to your account (intentionally or accidentally) in any form as photos, notes or other if it is not necessary.

##### Information we collect automatically when you use our services

All our accommodation and transport services providers may also share with us information about you and your trip.

##### Refer a friend

In case we would enable a refer-a-friend functionality, you must always seek your friend’s consent to our use of your friend’s name and e-mail address to contact them about our services.
