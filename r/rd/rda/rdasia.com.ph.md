# Privacy Policy | Reader's Digest Asia

## TO SERVE YOU BETTER… 

PRIVACY POLICY OF READER'S DIGEST ASIA PTE. LTD. Our contact information is: The Privacy Office, Reader's Digest, P.O. Box 600, Singapore Post Centre, Singapore 914020. You can also fax to 67491312, or email to [friends@rdasia.com.sg](mailto:friends@rdasia.com.sg)

**Collection of information**

Reader's Digest keeps/maintains a record of your custom with the Company, your contact details, your prize draw history and other information which you have provided to us.

We maintain your record so that:

  1. we can provide you with timely customer service;
  2. we can send you renewal subscription offers, new book and product offers, discounts and other benefit opportunities
  3. we can send you other prize draw opportunities, and
  4. we can service you the products which you have ordered.



Without this record, Reader's Digest would not be able to do any of this and, as such, the information you provide is required.

In addition, Reader's Digest occasionally, through proper contractual arrangements, will rent or acquire information from reliable third party companies regarding Singapore consumers (who have so consented). The only purpose for these occasional rental activities is to afford Reader's Digest the opportunity to send these consumers promotional offers and prize draw opportunities.

Furthermore, Reader's Digest will occasionally, through proper contractual agreements, disclose the contact details of certain of its customer base, of those who have so consented in advance, to reliable third party companies. The sole purpose of these disclosures is to allow these third party companies to send or make you consumer, financial and insurance offers that we believe may be of interest to our customers.

**Website cookies**

When you visit the RD website pages, our server makes a record of the visits and logs the user's server address, the user's top-level domain name, the date and time of visit to the site, the pages accessed and documents downloaded, the previous site visited and the type of browser used for statistical purposes. No attempt is made to identify users, or their browsing activities, unless a law enforcement agency or a court exercises a valid warrant to inspect the service provider's logs.

**Record of website visits**

RD makes use of "cookies" to make our website perform better. A "cookie" is a feature built into your browser that assigns you a "user ID". Cookies are used to follow the pattern of movements of web users. Cookies let us know which pages on our website are visited, in what order and how often. By themselves, cookies can't be used to discover your identity ­ they merely identify your computer to our servers when you visit us. If you are unhappy about having a cookie assigned to you, you can set your browser to refuse cookies. Cookies are not used to record any personal information such as your name, address or email address.

**Security**

When you begin to place credit card details on the RD Online Store or RD microsites, a secure system software called "Secure Sockets Layer" (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us.

**Third party links**

On occasion we include links to third parties on this website. Where we provide a link it does not mean that we endorse or approve that site’s policy towards visitor privacy. You should review their privacy policy before sending them any personal data.

\- accessing your record for review,  
\- correcting information in your record, and
