# Privacy policy

The RV Forum does not collect, with any intent to redistribute or sell, private information on any visitors to our web site, library, photo gallery, message boards, or live chat. However, please note the following:

With each visit, page view, and post, your IP address is recorded in our forum/server logs. In addition to allowing us to monitor and analyze traffic in our forum and the load on our server, the recorded IP address may be used in the event that you need to be banned from this forum or your ISP contacted. This will only happen in the event of a major violation of our forum user agreement or forum rules.

Our message boards are ad-free, but we use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website or forum library. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click [**here**](http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/faq.aspx).

In the case of our message boards, the software places a cookie, a text file containing bits of information (such as your user name and password), in your browser's cache. This is ONLY used to keep you logged in/out and to allow you to view or participate in areas of our forum that are not otherwise accessible. The software does not collect or send any other form of information to your computer.
