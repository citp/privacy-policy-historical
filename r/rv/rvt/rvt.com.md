### What personally identifiable information is collected from you

RVT Classifieds collects information in several ways from different parts of our web site from buyers, users and dealers.

Personal information is gathered when you register as a user or a dealer on our site. During registration, we ask for personally identifiable information such as, name and email address, street address, city, state/province, zip/postal code, country, telephone number, company name, vehicle information, and the URL of your web site, although only fields that are marked with an asterisk (*) on the registration field are required. This information is used solely to assist you in navigating the system by automatically filling in certain forms (such as the ad posting form) with your information so that you don't have to continually re-enter it. Once you register you are no longer anonymous to RVT – you have a username and are able to take full advantage of the many offerings of the RVT Classifieds.

In addition to registration we ask you for personal information at other times, including (but not limited to) when you place ads or take advantage of the other features of the RVT Classifieds such as Auto Notify, Dealer Inventory, and Contact us. We use the information submitted only to provide the service you have requested and for no other purpose. If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence. Every page within the RVT Classifieds includes a link to this Privacy Policy.

If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you can still use most of the RVT Classifieds, but you will not be able to access areas or use features that require registration.

### What cookies are and how they are used

As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, the RVT Classifieds uses [cookies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie) to store and track information about you. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Several features of the RVT Classifieds require that you accept cookies in order to work properly.

Generally, we use cookies for the following purposes and they are not tied to personally identifiable information: 

  1. To identify and label all “new” ads since your last visit to the site.
  2. Optionally to permanently save your password on your computer so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site.
  3. To enable you to “checklist” ads that you want to mark for future retrieval and viewing.



By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies you will be unable to use those services of the RVT Classifieds that require registration in order to participate. These services include the identification of new ads that have been posted since your last visit, auto-fill in of the logon form, and the Checklist feature. You can still use most of the features of the RVT Classifieds even if you do not accept cookies.

Advertising networks that serve ads onto the RVT Classifieds may also use their own cookies. We have no access to or control over these cookies.

We use a third-party tracking service that uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate.

### Log Files

The RVT Classifieds may also collect IP addresses via the use of log files for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically collected data to personally identifiable information.

### Email-A-Friend

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. RVT does not store this information.

Please be aware that information that you submit in your classified ad can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.

### How you can access, update or delete your information

We will provide you with the means to ensure that your personal information is correct and current. You may edit or delete your user profile at any time by clicking on the "My Profile" link or graphic provided by the system once you are logged in. Once you have logged onto the system during a given session, wherever you go on the RVT Classifieds, your information will stay with you until or unless you click on the “Logout” link, which is accessible at the top of every page. If you are a previously registered user and you have lost or forgotten your password, you may obtain it by email by using our “Forgot Password” feature. Click the button on any login page to request that your password be emailed to you. We cannot provide your password by any other means. Your RVT Classifieds account can be deleted by emailing [tradersupport@rvt.com](mailto:tradersupport@rvt.com) or calling 800-677-4484, but doing so will result in not being able to access any of the features of the program that require user registration. If you have any questions regarding your account, please contact us at [tradersupport@rvt.com](mailto:tradersupport@rvt.com).

### The kind of security precautions that are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of your information

Other than the administrator of the RVT Classifieds or other authorized personnel of the RVT, you are the only person who has access to your personal information. Your user registration is password-protected to prevent unauthorized access. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. RVT will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. As an extra security precaution, you may want to logoff once you have completed a session in the RVT Classifieds. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, RVT cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.

### How RVT protects children’s privacy

RVT is a general audience web site and is not intended for anyone under the age of 13. We do not collect age identifying information on our site, however, if we find out that someone under the age of 13 has submitted information to our site, we will delete this information immediately.

### What else you should know about your online privacy

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online – for example in ads that you post or through email – that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.

### Changes in this Privacy Statement

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.
