In some circumstances, RJMetrics uses cookies to enhance the functionality of the Site. A cookie is a small data file on the hard drive of your computer. RJMetrics uses cookies to identify a customer and to store registration details so that the customer is no longer required to re-enter these details on subsequent visits. In addition, RJMetrics uses cookies to indicate the number of computers used by each customer to log-in to the Site, and to prevent abuse of the Site and logins. RJMetrics also collects information on referring websites, IP addresses and web browsers used by customers when they access the Site, and uses such information for the same reasons mentioned above. You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts or functionality of the Site. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, the Site will issue cookies when you log on to the Site. Please note that RJMetrics may use technology service providers to help monitor Site usage. Some of these service providers may collect non-personally identifiable information through cookies on RJMetrics’ behalf.

RJMetrics may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to third party vendors used by RJMetrics for customer relationship management purposes, including the distribution of email communications. RJMetrics does not permit third party vendors to use Personally Identifiable Information for any purpose outside of those disclosed within this Privacy Policy. RJMetrics may disclose the names of users of the Site to enquiring parties only if the enquiring party is from the same organization as the user.

  * In the event that RJMetrics sells or buys any business or assets, in which case RJMetrics may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets;
  * If RJMetrics or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case Personally Identifiable Information held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets;
  * If RJMetrics is under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation;
  * To protect the rights, property or safety of RJMetrics or its customers, which includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.



RJMetrics may combine your Personally Identifiable Information with that of RJMetrics’ other users, for the purpose of creating aggregate usage statistics which do not identify you as the source of any specific piece of data (the "Aggregate Data"). RJMetrics shall be the sole owner of the Aggregate Data and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, shall be free to use and disclose the Aggregate Data at its discretion.

## Where RJMetrics stores your Personally Identifiable Information

By submitting Personally Identifiable Information to RJMetrics, you consent to the transfer and storage of such Personally Identifiable Information for processing by RJMetrics in a country of its choosing, including, but not limited to, the United States. RJMetrics will take reasonable steps to ensure that your Personally Identifiable Information is stored in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## Securing your personal data

RJMetrics takes reasonable steps to protect your Personally Identifiable Information as you transmit such information from your computer to the Site, and to protect such information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. You should keep in mind, however, that no internet transmission is 100% secure or error-free. In particular, e-mail sent to or from the Site may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to the Site via e-mail or other electronic means. Where RJMetrics has given you a username and/or password which enables you to access certain parts of the RJMetrics website, you are responsible for keeping such username and/or password confidential.
