RJMetrics also collects information on referring websites, IP addresses and web browsers used by customers when they access the Site, and uses such information for the same reasons mentioned above. You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts or functionality of the Site. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, the Site will issue cookies when you log on to the Site. Please note that RJMetrics may use technology service providers to help monitor Site usage. Some of these service providers may collect non-personally identifiable information through cookies on RJMetrics’ behalf.

### Securing your personal data

RJMetrics takes reasonable steps to protect your Personally Identifiable Information as you transmit such information from your computer to the Site, and to protect such information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. You should keep in mind, however, that no internet transmission is 100% secure or error-free.
