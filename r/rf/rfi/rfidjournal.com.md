# RFID Journal - - RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) Technology News & Features

RFID Journal LLC. ("RFID Journal") recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of all information provided by users of our Web site and recipients of our e-mail newsletters. We created this policy with a fundamental respect for our users’ right to privacy and to guide our relationships with our users. This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for all products and services owned by RFID Journal, including but not limited to Web sites and newsletters. 

**Information Collection And Use**   
RFID Journal collects information from our Web site users, subscribers and customers. In this section of our privacy policy, we will describe the type of information we collect and how we use it to provide better services to our customers. 

**Web Site Usage**   
You may visit the RFID Journal Web site without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information. As you use the site, the site collects log file, the IP address of your computer, and other standard tracking data that RFID Journal use to evaluate site traffic and usage patterns. This information is aggregated with tracking data from all site visitors and is used both to enable us to tailor content to the interests of visitors and to inform advertisers of the usage patterns and interests of our readers. 

**Registering and Subscribing**   
When attending our events, signing up for certain selected services (such as free subscriptions), or subscribing to our paid content, users must first register. During registration, users are required to give their contact information (such as name, e-mail address, mailing address and phone number). We also collect demographic information (such as job title and purchasing responsibilities, and company information). For internal purposes, we use this information to communicate with users and provide requested services. We use aggregate demographic information about our audience to improve our service, for marketing purposes and/or industry reporting purposes. 

**Surveys**   
From time to time we invite users to provide information via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether to disclose requested contact information (such as name and mailing address) and demographic information (such as zip code or job title). This information is used in accordance with other uses set forth in this policy. 

**Communications with Us**   
We have features where users can submit information to us (such as our feedback forms). Letters to the editor and similar submissions may be made public. Requests for service, support or information may be forwarded as needed to best respond to a specific request. We may retain e-mails and other information sent to us for our internal administrative purposes, and to help us to serve customers better. 

**Communications from Us**   
In order to best serve our customers, we may send updates that contain important information about our sites and services. For example, we send new members a welcoming message, and verify password and username for our password-protected sites. We may also communicate with a user to provide requested services and for account-related issues via e-mail, phone or regular mail. 

**Cookies**   
We use "cookies," a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Cookies benefit the user by requiring login only once, thereby saving time while on our site. If users reject the cookies, they may be limited in the use of some areas of our site. Cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our sites. 

Some of our business affiliates use cookies on our sites in ads or promotions. However, we have no access to or control over these business affiliates' cookies; we urge users to read their privacy policies for information. 

For our internal purposes, we gather date, time, browser type, navigation history and IP address of all visitors to our site. This information does not contain anything that can identify users personally. We use this information for our internal security audit log, trend analysis and system administration, and to gather broad demographic information about our user base for aggregate use. 

We may combine demographic information supplied by a subscriber at registration with site usage data to provide general profiles, in aggregate non-personally identifiable form, about our users and their preferences in the content of the site and advertising. We may share this composite information with our advertisers and business affiliates to help them better understand our services. 

**Interactive Features**   
At some of our sites, we offer interactive and community features such as discussion boards. Note that all personal information sent or posted via such features becomes public information for which we are not responsible. 

**With Whom Your Information Is Shared**   
We may share your personal information with our affiliates and partners and third parties licensed to access your personal information by any of the foregoing. We rent e-mail lists compiled from e-mail addresses gathered from this web site to those partners or affiliates that we feel may offer products or services that may be of interest to our readers. We do not share credit card information with third parties. 

Except as otherwise provided in this privacy policy, RFID Journal will keep your personal information and your financial information private and will not share it with third parties, unless such disclosure is necessary to: (a) comply with a court order or other legal process; (b) protect our rights or property; or (c) enforce our terms of service. Users should also be aware that courts of equity, such as U.S. Bankruptcy Courts, might have the authority under certain circumstances to permit personal information to be shared or transferred to third parties without permission. 

We may share aggregate information, which is not personally identifiable, with others. This information may include usage and demographic data, but it will not include personal information. 

**Correction/Updating Personal Information**   
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code), or if a user no longer desires our product(s)/service(s), we provide a way to correct or update that user's personal data. The user should contact Customer Support for the applicable product or service. 

**Security**   
We use reasonable precautions to protect our users' personal information and to store it securely. Sensitive information that is transmitted to us online (such as credit card number) is encrypted and is transmitted to us securely. In addition, access to all of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. 

**Links**   
Our web site contains links to other sites. RFID Journal is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such external sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each web site to which we may link that may collect personally identifiable information. 

**Notification And Changes**   
If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so our users are aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under which circumstances, if any, we disclose it. Users should check this policy frequently to keep abreast of any changes. 

For questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site or any dealings with RFID Journal, send e-mail to [info@rfidjournal.com](mailto:info@rfidjournal.com?subject=).
