The Rugby Football Union (RFU) are committed to protecting your privacy and to developing technology that gives you the most powerful and secure online experience. In general, you can view this site and all the latest news and results without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. Sometimes however, the RFU need information to track the useability and behaviour of our systems. 

Also certain functions and services will require information from you in order to work, such as your name, email and eventually address and mobile telephone number. It is our intent to let you know before we collect personal information from you on the Internet.

We use personal information for four primary purposes: 

  * To make the site easier for you to use by not making you enter your personal information more than once. 
  * To help you quickly find what your looking for.. 
  * To help us create and deliver content most relevant to you. 
  * To alert you to new services, special offers, and other info.



If you choose to give us personal information to 

    * process an order or 
    * provide you with a subscription to a free service



then this will be held by The RFU and/or organisations who will process it on the RFU's behalf. For the purposes of administering your order, it may be necessary for your information to be passed by the RFU or an organisation as mentioned above. 

Also the RFU may use your personal information to supply you with information about the RFU or its related organisations, and new services offered to the game, as well as their respective activities and ranges of goods, services and opportunities, and/or for general statistical purposes. 

We do keep track of the domains from which users visit us. We analyse this data for:

  * trends and statistics and evaluate the efficiency of our web site and our internet infrastructure
  * to ensure that services offered (such as but limited to chat and forums) are not abused



We then discard such information.
