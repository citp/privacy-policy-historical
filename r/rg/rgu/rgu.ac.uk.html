	<p><strong>What is a cookie?</strong></p>
<p>Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information
which are downloaded to your device when you visit a website. Cookies are then
sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another
website that recognises that cookie. Cookies are useful because they allow a
website to recognise a user’s device. You can find more information about

International Chamber of Commerce UK Cookie guide. A list of all the cookies
used on this website by category is set out below.</p>
<h4>Category
1: strictly necessary cookies</h4>
<p>These cookies are essential in order to
enable you to move around the website and use its features, such as accessing
secure areas of the website, assisting navigation and adjusting the colours of
