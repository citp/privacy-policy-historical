We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time.  If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as by adding a statement to our homepage or by sending you a notification).  We encourage you to review our Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.

<h2>Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others</h2>

We may allow others to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet and to provide analytics services.  These entities may use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and other websites, including your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and conversion information.

For example, we may use Remarketing with Google Analytics to advertise online.  This enables third-party vendors, including Google, to show our ads on sites across the Internet.  Such third-party vendors, including Google, may use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to our website.  We also may use Google Display Network Impression Reporting to determine the effectiveness of certain advertising and content, and Google Analytics Demographic and Interest Reporting to better understand the demographics and interests of our users.

<h3>Rhapsody Profile Privacy Settings</h3>
<p>
You have the ability to customize your Rhapsody profile and control whether your profile is accessible to other users of the Services.  Initially, your Rhapsody profile will be anonymous.  If you choose to make your customized profile accessible to other users, the information in your profile and certain other information about your use of the Services (such as your playlists, music library and listening preferences) will be accessible to other users of the Services.

Certain features of the Services may require access to your device's native address book application (e.g., to help you locate contact information of friends and family members in order to share information with them via email).

Note that you can revoke your consent at any time and prevent us from accessing your address book application by changing your preferences on your mobile device.

<p>
By downloading and launching any of our mobile applications that collect location information, you consent to such applications' collection of this information.  If you initially consent to our collection of location information, you can subsequently stop the collection of this information at any time by changing your preferences on your mobile device.  If you do so, certain features of our mobile applications may no longer function.  You also may stop our collection of location information by following the standard uninstall process to remove all of our mobile applications from your device.
</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>

Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default.  If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies.  Removing or rejecting browser cookies does not necessarily affect third-party flash cookies used in connection with our Services.  To delete or disable flash cookies, please visit
