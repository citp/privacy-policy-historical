# Lycos Zone Privacy Vow

[](https://www.truste.org/validate/1031) | 

  
Lycos, Inc. has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this Web site: Lycos Zone   
  
---|---  
  
Lycos Zone was designed to provide a safe neighborhood on the Web for children 3 to 12 years old and their families. Lycos Zone is separate from the rest of the Lycos Network, where each site offers distinct features and targets a specific Web audience through unique programming. The policy on this page reflects our company's commitment to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and children's safety on the Internet. To learn more about COPPA within the other properties of the Lycos Network, please visit <http://www.lycos.com/privacy/coppa.html>.

**TRUSTe Certified**  
Lycos Zone is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization with a mission to build trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the principles of disclosure and informed consent. Because Lycos Zone wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, we have agreed to disclose our information practices and have our privacy practices reviewed and audited for compliance by TRUSTe. You can verify our TRUSTe license and learn more about their Privacy Program by clicking [here](https://www.truste.org/validate/1031).

**What information is being collected, and who is collecting it?**  
Lycos Zone does not collect any personally identifiable information. We do collect anonymous information in aggregate form as described below in the discussions about cookies and IP addresses. All of the homework, news, fun, parents and teachers zones are available for free, without you having to disclose any information about yourself. 

Lycos Zone also contains links to external Web sites that have been co-branded with Lycos Zone. Registration is not required or requested on most co-branded sites. However, Lycos Zone is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such sites. 

We encourage parents to participate in their child's Internet experience. Children should never give away any information about themselves without getting permission from their parents. 

Some Lycos Zone co-branded sites are operated by educational nonprofit organizations that require some registration information from children with adult consent. Note: the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) does not apply to nonprofit entities. Registration is required on these sites in order to track the child's success and maintain scores and averages. Parental notification and consent are part of the registration process. Current nonprofit organizations featured on the site are:

**BOOK ADVENTURE** \- If registering at home, a user must provide a first name and first initial of last name. If registering in the classroom, a teacher must register the children.

**CYBERSURFARI** \- Children registering individually are not allowed to provide any registration information.

The only required information to enter a student is first name and T-shirt size.

**Does Lycos Zone use cookies?**  
A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification number that is transferred from a Web site to the hard drive of your computer so that the site administrator may identify your computer and passively track its activities on the Web site. A cookie will not let a Web site know any personally identifiable information about you, such as your real name or address.

Lycos Zone sets a user cookie when a person visits our pages so we can recognize the number of unique users who visit our site. Lycos Zone does not interact with any other cookies that are used by other sites within the Lycos Network or third party sites. Some Lycos Zone co-branded sites will set additional user cookies when you visit their pages, also for the purpose of recognizing unique visitors. 

If you prefer, you can reset your browser to notify you when you have received a cookie. You can also refuse to accept cookies altogether. Lycos Zone does not require you to use cookies.

**What about IP addresses?**  
Lycos Zone collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. No personally identifiable information is collected along with your IP address. If advertisers ask, Lycos Zone will provide them only with information on which ISP a visitor came from (AOL, MindSpring, etc.) or the type of browser used. However, most advertisers don't care about or ask for such information.

**Notification of Changes**  
Lycos Zone does not collect any personally identifiable information. If we decide to change this policy we will inform users with a statement on our site.

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact Lycos Zone's Privacy Site Coordinator:
