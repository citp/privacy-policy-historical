5.              To whom we may disclose your Personal Information

 _Intra-group sharing_

Your Personal Information may be shared between the different companies and brands of our group, for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice. As we have stated above, this Privacy Notice applies to all these companies’ and brands’ use of your Personal Information. For more information about us, our companies, our brands and our presence in your jurisdiction, please visit __[www.rb.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20190505102122id_/https://www.rb.com/privacy-policy/www.rb.com).

 _Third party service providers_

We may share your Personal Information with trusted third party service providers who work on our behalf, such as marketing agencies, market research companies, e-commerce fulfilment partners, software, data hosting and other IT service providers, merchants selling RB products, call centres, payment processors, etc. These third party service providers are required not to use your Personal Information other than to provide the services requested by us or otherwise in accordance with our instructions.

 _Other trusted third parties_

We may also share your Personal Information with other trusted third parties, such as our business partners, advertisers (where we are permitted to do so) and data exchanges, so that we can offer you tailored content, including more relevant advertising for products and services which may be of interest to you. These third parties may set and access their own cookies, web beacons and similar tracking technologies on your device in order to deliver customized content and advertising to you when you visit RB websites.

Our websites and/or applications may also allow you to log in using a social network or other third-party account. An example of a third-party login is “Log in with Facebook”. Logging into one of our sites with your social network or other third-party account may allow us to gather information that you give us permission to access from that social network or third party. The login feature may also transfer information to the social network or third party, such as your username and password, to authenticate you. The social network or third party may also automatically collect information such as your IP address, information about your browser and device, and the address of the web page you are visiting on our site. The login feature may also place and read cookies from that third party that may contain a unique identifier the social network or other third party assigns to you. The functionality of, and your use of, the login is governed by the privacy policy and terms of the party that provided the login functionality, rather than this Privacy Notice.

 _Acquisitions_

If another company acquires (part of) our company, business, or our assets, that company may acquire all or part of the Personal Information collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Notice. In the unlikely event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership, your Personal Information may also be transferred as a business asset, subject of applicable law.

 _Disclosures_

We may disclose your Personal Information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary for our legitimate interest or prudent in light of our obligations under applicable law:

  * in connection with any legal investigation;
  * to comply with relevant laws or to respond to court our authority orders, subpoenas or warrants served on us;
  * to protect or defend our rights in legal procedures; or
  * to investigate or assist in preventing any violation or potential violation of the law, this Privacy Notice, or any applicable Terms of Use.



6.              How we protect your Personal Information

We value the trust you place in us.

We have implemented appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your Personal Information against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access and against all other unlawful forms of processing.

When collecting or transferring Sensitive Personal Information we use a variety of additional security technologies and procedures to help protect your this information.

The Personal Information you provide us with is stored on computer systems located in controlled facilities which can only be accessed by a limited number of persons who have a need to know in order to carry out their tasks and any services requested by you.

When we process highly confidential information (such as credit card numbers) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption.

7.              Your choices regarding direct marketing

We may periodically send you free newsletters, surveys, offers, and other promotional materials related to our products and services which we believe are useful for you, if you have consented (opted-in) to receive such messages via e-mail or any other electronic channel (where such opt-in is required under your local law).

If you do not wish to receive such communications anymore, you will always have the opportunity to "opt out" by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in each of our direct marketing e-mails or by contacting us directly (please see our contact information at “how to contact us” below).

Where permitted under applicable law, we may send you service messages identifying any updates to our Privacy Notice (even where you have opted out of receiving marketing messages from us).

8.              Your rights

Depending on your location, you may have various rights in relation to your Personal Information. In particular, you may have the right to:

  * request a copy of Personal Information we hold about you;
  * ask that we restrict the way in which we use your Personal Information;
  * ask that we update the Personal Information we hold about you, or correct any Personal Information that you think is incorrect or incomplete;
  * ask that we delete personal data that we hold about you (the “right to be forgotten”);
  * withdraw consent at any time for the future to our processing of your Personal Information (to the extent such processing is based on consent);
  * object to our processing of your Personal Information (including for direct marketing purposes); or
  * request your personal data be transferred to you or another data controller (the “data portability” right).



In addition, in certain circumstances we may process your personal data through automated decision-making, including profiling. This may include segmenting and tailoring the data to enable us to match our communication and products to your perceived needs. In the case we process your Personal Information through automated decision-making, we will inform you about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for you. Depending on your location, you may be able to request not to be subject to automated decision-making, including profiling.

9.              Complaints

If you are unhappy with the way we have handled your Personal Information or any privacy query or request that you have raised with us, you have a right to complain to your local data protection regulator.

10.           How long we retain your Personal Information

We will only retain your Personal Information as long as reasonably required for the purposes as set out in this Privacy Notice or otherwise to comply with legal or regulatory requirements applicable to us.

When your Personal Information is processed:

§ for the performance of your contract with us, we retain your Personal Information for a period of 7 years following completion of a contractual order;

§ for meeting, legal and regulatory requirements, we retain your Personal Information as it is set out by the applicable law; and

§ In all other cases, we process your Personal Information, depending on the type, for up to 2 years from the date of our last interaction with you.

11.           Children

Most of our Sites are not directed towards children and we request that children below the age of 16 do not provide Personal Information through our Sites.

If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 16 who has registered on one of our Sites, or who you believe has otherwise provided Personal Information to us, please contact us using the details set out at “how to contact us” below to have the information deleted. Information voluntarily provided by children via e-mails, message boards, chat sessions etc. may be used by other parties to generate unsolicited e-mails. We encourage parents and legal guardians to inform children about how to use the Internet in a safe and responsible manner.

Depending on your location and where permitted by local law, we _may_ collect information on your children in order to provide you with relevant information about our products and services.

12.           Transfers to other countries

Your Personal Information may be transferred to and processed in other countries where laws governing the processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in your country (including jurisdictions outside the European Economic Area).

In such cases, where required by local law we will ensure that there are adequate safeguards in place to protect your Personal Information. Depending on the location of the RB entity exporting the relevant Personal Information, this adequate safeguard might be a data transfer agreement with the recipient based on standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission. Where we are legally required to do so, further details of these transfers and copies of these agreements are available from us on request.

To the extent required and valid under your local law, you consent to your Personal Information being transferred and processed this way.

13.           How to contact us
