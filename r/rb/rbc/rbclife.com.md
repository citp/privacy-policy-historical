Security
We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the rbclife.com or myrbclife.com websites, your

Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is digitally encrypted and transmitted to us using industry
standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology. This information is never sent over the public network and is available only to RBC
Life. You can verify your shopping session is secure during the “check-out” procedure by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web
browser, or looking for “https” at the beginning of the address of the web page.
While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need
the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The
computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
