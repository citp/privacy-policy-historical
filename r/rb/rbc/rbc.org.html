<b><i><font face="Arial" size="4"><p>Privacy Policy - RBC Ministries</p>
</font></i></b><font face="Arial">
<p>RBC Ministries makes it a high priority to protect your privacy in every area of our Web site. We have developed this privacy policy to help you understand how we use the information we may collect from you throughout our site. This policy applies to every area of the RBC Ministries site. This statement was last updated on October 28, 2002.</p>

<ol>

<b></b><li><b>RBC MINISTRIES PERSONAL INFORMATION POLICY: <br>
</b>RBC Ministries maintains a strict company-wide policy that we will never sell, rent, or otherwise give your private information to other organizations, commercial or non-profit. The only exception would be to comply with the law, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of RBC Ministries, our users, or others. Any personally identifiable information (name, address, and/or e-mail address) that you submit to us is used only for the purpose for which it was given (product order form, to receive e-mail newsletter, etc.).<br><br>
</li>
<b></b><li><b>LOG FILE TRACKING: <br>
</b>RBC Ministries uses log files to track trends, activity, and improve the user experience. This information is shared among RBC employees and leadership and is archived for analysis in the future. These log files contain information about what domain you are coming from (ex. aol.com, msn.com), what browser software and system software you use, and what pages were visited on our site. None of this log file information is linked to the personally identifiable information that you may submit to our site. In other words, all information in this log file is anonymous information.<br><br>
</li>
<b></b><li><b>SITE SECURITY INFORMATION:</b><br>
We at RBC Ministries are committed to safeguarding all information that is submitted to our site. All sensitive information is encrypted when it is sent from our Web site to our processors. We use quality built firewalls to protect our servers, PGP encryption for e-mail protection, and the industry-standard encryption technology known as Secure Socket Layer (SSL). This SSL technology prevents eavesdropping on information shared between your browser and our servers. <br>
</li>
<b></b><li><b>RBC MINISTRIES COOKIE POLICY:</b><br>
From time to time, we may place a "cookie" within your browser software. A cookie is a small text file that our server sends to your browser software with information to help our site function more effectively for you. We use cookies to collect session information, to track your use of the site, and to customize the content you view. Most Internet browser software automatically accepts cookies. However, you can instruct your browser to either not accept cookies or to alert you every time a cookie is presented. You can find these settings in your browser software options. If you decide to not accept cookies, you will still be able to visit the majority of our sites, but some areas may not be accessible.<br><br>
</li>

<b></b><li><b>RBC E-MAIL LIST POLICY:<br>
</b>RBC Ministries only collects and sends e-mail to those who have chosen to receive e-mail correspondence from us. All RBC e-mail list sign-ups are "opt-in," meaning you need to choose to receive this information. We also send a confirmation e-mail to the addresses of those who sign up on our Web site. This confirmation serves two purposes. First, to confirm that this is your e-mail address. Secondly, when you respond to the confirmation e-mail it adds your address to our list. Included with all e-mails that we send out are clear, easy instructions on how to remove yourself from our list.<br><br>
</li>
<b></b><li><b>RBC MINISTRIES ONLINE SURVEY POLICY:<br>
</b>From time to time, RBC Ministries will ask you, as a Web-site visitor, to complete a survey. This information is collected to help us better understand who visits our site, what interests or content our visitors prefer, and the effectiveness of our Web site. This information is anonymous and used within the organization to make decisions about the direction and effectiveness of our Web ministry.<br><br>
</li>
<b></b><li><b>RBC MINISTRIES MESSAGE BOARD POLICY:<br>
</b>Any information that is posted to message boards, chat rooms, or the like on the RBC Ministries site becomes public information. RBC Ministries is not responsible for any unacceptable language or topics discussed, but we will do everything we can to assure that these areas are monitored and that the appropriate topics are discussed. <br><br>
</li>
<b></b><li><b>RBC MINISTRIES ABOUT LINKS TO OTHER SITES:<br>
</b>The RBC Ministries site contains links to other Web sites. We encourage you to visit these Web sites to learn about their privacy policies as theirs may differ from ours. We encourage you to read the privacy statement of any Web site you may visit.<br><br>
</li>
<b></b><li><b>RBC MINISTRIES POLICY CONCERNING USE OF SITE BY CHILDREN:</b><br>
We ask that children under the age of 16 not submit information to our site without the permission of a parent or guardian. There are areas of the RBC Ministries site that may not be appropriate for younger Internet users because the content is targeting adult issues. We encourage parents of younger children to surf the Internet, not just the RBC Ministries site, with their children.<br><br>
</li>
<b></b><li><b>ACCEPTENCE OF THIS POLICY:<br>
</b>Use of this site will constitute the user’s acceptance of this privacy policy. If you have any questions about this privacy policy or about the information that we have collected, please feel free to contact us.</li></ol>
