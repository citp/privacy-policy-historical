For example, cookies help us to understand the popular paths that users take through the Royal Bank website and how often people visit. Some of our general management information is collected using third party tracking code provided by Red Sheriff. We do not share information with other companies that use the same third party tracking code or combine any data collected by Red Sheriff with any personal information collected on the Royal Bank website.
