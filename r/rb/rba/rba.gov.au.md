In addition, our server logs the following information: 

  * the date and time of your visit; and

#### E-mail Service (Subscriptions)

Some pages of this website provide the facility for visitors to join our free e-mail notification service. To join, visitors must provide a valid e-mail address.

#### Job Applications

Please do not submit your personal information if you do not want your information to be dealt with in the ways described in this statement.  


By submitting an application or registering interest in employment with the Reserve Bank of Australia, you will supply us with personal information, including application data and contact details (‘your information’).

Once submitted, your personal information will be stored on a separate server owned and managed by our recruitment application service provider PageUp. Your personal information can only be accessed by authorised staff at PageUp and Reserve Bank of Australia.

Once submitted, Reserve Bank of Australia staff will use the information you have provided to: 

  * assess and administer your application for employment; 
  * communicate with you in relation to your application;
  * comply with any legal or regulatory obligations; and
  * monitor and review our recruitment practices. 



If your application is unsuccessful, the Reserve Bank of Australia may retain your information on file and may contact you if a suitable employment opportunity arises. Please contact us if you do not wish the Reserve Bank of Australia to retain your information on file. If your application is successful, the Reserve Bank of Australia will retain your information as part of your employment records.

You may request access to your information (and for amendments to be made to your information) at any time by contacting us at [careers@rba.gov.au](mailto:careers@rba.gov.au)

We use these search terms to find out what visitors look for on our website, and to improve our services. 

#### Cookies

The Reserve Bank does not use 'cookies' to get information about you or your use of our website. A 'cookie' is a file that could be placed on your hard drive by a website without your knowledge to allow it to monitor how the site is used.

If you provide the Reserve Bank with personal information via e-mail or any other means, your information may become part of the records of the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank takes all reasonable care to secure personal information and protect it against unauthorised access and misuse. If you are submitting personal or other information over the Internet please note that, while all attempts are made to ensure security of information transmitted to this site, there is a possibility that information you send could be seen by a third party while it is in transit. 

Personal information from our ISP logs will only be disclosed if the Reserve Bank is required by law to do so.
