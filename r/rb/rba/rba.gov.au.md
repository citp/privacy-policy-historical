  * your top level domain name (for example .com, .gov, .au, .uk, etc.);
  * the address of the referring website (i.e. the website that directed you to our website); and
  * your server's IP address (a number which is unique to the machine through which you are connected to the Internet: usually one of your service provider's machines).



In addition, our server logs the following information:

  * the date and time of your visit; and 
  * the address of the pages accessed and the documents downloaded.



Information from ISP logs will only be disclosed if the RBA is required by law to do so.

  * apply for a job; 
  * include your e-mail address when submitting a completed Education Survey; or
  * register for our e-mail notification service.



Your e-mail address will only be used for the purpose for which you provide it, and will not be added to a mailing list or provided to a third party unless you request that this be done. We will not disclose your e-mail address or personal information without your consent. __

#### E-mail Service (Subscriptions)

Some pages of this website provide the facility for visitors to join our free e-mail notification service. To join, visitors must provide a valid e-mail address.

Personal details provided for the purpose of our e-mail service are stored on a separate server owned and managed by our e-mail list management service provider L-Soft international, Inc. Your e-mail details can only be accessed by authorised L-Soft and authorised RBA staff.

#### Job Applications

If you apply for a job at the RBA, you will be asked to supply your personal information. Your personal information will be used only for the purpose for which you provided it.

Once submitted, your personal information will be stored on a separate server owned and managed by our recruitment application service provider RecruitASP. Your personal information can only be accessed by authorised RecruitASP and authorised RBA staff.

RBA staff will use the information you have provided to:

  * assess and administer your application;
  * communicate with you in relation to your application; and
  * monitor and review our recruitment practices.



All personal information, which you provide, associated with job applications including any supporting documents, will be stored securely. Only authorised RBA staff will have access to it. Unsuccessful applications may be destroyed.

#### Search terms and phrases

Search terms and phrases that you use to reach our website, including those used via the RBA website search facility, are collected, but are not associated with any other information that we collect. We use these search terms to find out what visitors look for on our website, and to improve our services.

#### Cookies

The RBA does not use 'cookies' to get information about you or your use of our website. A 'cookie' is a file that could be placed on your hard drive by a website without your knowledge to allow it to monitor how the site is used.

Any changes to our ‘cookies’ policy will be notified on this page.

#### Links to other sites

Links to other websites are provided to help us meet your needs but the RBA is not responsible for the content or privacy policies of those sites. Our [Disclaimer](https://web.archive.org/Disclaimer/index.html) provides further information.

### Security of Information

If you provide the RBA with personal information via e-mail or any other means, your information may become part of the records of the RBA. The RBA takes all reasonable care to secure personal information and protect it against unauthorised access and misuse. If you are submitting personal or other information over the Internet please note that, while all attempts are made to ensure security of information transmitted to this site, there is a possibility that information you send could be seen by a third party while it is in transit.

Personal information from our ISP logs will only be disclosed if the RBA is required by law to do so. ****

### Access to Information

No attempt will be made by the RBA to identify visitors or their browsing activities except where required by law or when authorised by RBA management in connection with investigations into possible breaches of the law.

When required by law, e.g. search warrant or subpoena, personal information requested (including an inspection of our ISP logs) will be provided to law enforcement agencies, courts or regulatory bodies.
