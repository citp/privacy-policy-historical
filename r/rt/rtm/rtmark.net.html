<h2>Information We Collect Through our Services </h2>

<h3>We do not collect PII. </h3>
<p>
We do not collect the online user’s personally identifiable information ("PII") through our Services. PII generally refers to information such as an individual’s name, mailing address, phone number or e-mail address. 
</p>
<h2>Non-Personal Information Collected by our Services </h2>
<p>
We offer a range of Services that allow advertisers and publishers to show online users the most useful and relevant ads online. 
</p>
<p>
We may collect non-personally identifiable information ("Non-PII") regarding the user’s behavior and usage patterns on advertisements and sites operated by our clients to better customize the type of advertisements users see on various sites. Non-PII may include information such as the type of Internet browser used by an online user, the type of computer operating system used, the domain name of the website visited, as well as information related to websites and web pages a user is viewing when an advertisement is shown. 
</p>
<p>
We collect Non-PII through the use of cookies and pixels. No personally identifiable information is collected or used in this process. A cookie is a file on your browser that uniquely identifies your browser. A pixel is a line of code which is used by a Web site or third party ad server to track a user’s activity. The use of a pixel allows us to record that a user has visited a particular webpage along with additional Non-PII that the website publisher or advertiser may choose to include with the pixel. 
</p>
<p>
The use of cookies by our affiliates, service providers or tracking utility company is not covered by our Privacy Policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. These third parties use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. 
</p>
<h2>Disclosure of Information to Third Parties </h2>
<p>
We do not collect PII via our Services, and therefore, we do not sell, rent, or share PII collected on our customer’s websites to non-affiliated third parties. 
</p>
<p>
We may disclose Non-PII collected through our Services, and information derived from it, to our customers. This Non-PII may be used by our customers to deliver tailored ads to users on participating websites. This information cannot be used to contact or identify any person individually. Further, all of our customers have warranted that they shall use any Non-PII they receive in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 
</p>
<p>
We may disclose a user’s information to third parties when we reasonably believe we are obligated to do so by law, and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including, but not limited to, fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person. 
</p>
<h2>User Choice </h2>
<p>
We use technology, which includes cookies, in the delivery of our Services. We believe that the use of these tools enables us and our advertiser clients to provide users with a more meaningful web experience. 
</p>

You can remove cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s "help" file. 
</p>
<p>
You may also simply opt out of receiving interest-based advertising by clicking <a href="optout.html">here</a>. 
</p>
<p>

If you buy a new computer, upgrade or change Web browsers or delete this "opt-out" cookie, you will need to perform this opt-out process again. In order for the opt-out to work, your browser must be set to accept 3rd party cookies. Opting out does not necessarily delete or replace all cookies from our domain. 
</p>
