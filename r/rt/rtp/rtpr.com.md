What they say about Real Time Pain Relief

I give this stuff a 5 star rating because I had just had my tooth pulled and I was in severe pain nothing was helping not even my pain killers or icing it. 

I do not have any image to add but this RTPR really works and it is very concentrated. 

Have been using RTPR for only 3 weeks but my foot is feeling great.Have had trouble with the right foot for over 15 months;went to the foot doctor twice;he was no help. 

RTPR is a awesome product that just flat-out works without the concerns of getting addicted or worrying about harmful side-effects of oral pain medication or pain killers. Just rub it on the area where the pain is and that is all. 

I have osteoarthritis and the first thing in the morning, I put Real Time Pain Relief on my neck, shoulders, elbows, mid back, right hip, both knees and especially the right knee, both ankles and my right foot and toes. 

Lord this stuff gave me relief like no other I brought this stuff and will use nothing else. I quit my pain medicine cause this helped more than my Norco helped and faster.
