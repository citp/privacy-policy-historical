_2\. What Information Do We Collect?_

Personal information is information that identifies you and that may be used to contact you online or offline. We may collect personal information from you automatically and on a voluntary basis, as described below. Our primary goals in collecting and using information are to create your account, provide services to you, improve our services, contact you, conduct research and create reports for internal use.? 

Our Site

While you are browsing our Site, we collect personal information such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address automatically. Your IP address is included in a log file containing non-personal information such as your computer's operating system, access times, browser type and coarse geo-location. We may use this information to monitor and analyze your use of the services. In addition, we may ask you to submit and we may process data that is personal to you, including but not limited to your name, user name and email address. We may use this information to create a user profile. We may use your email address to contact you about our password reset. 

Forums

We may offer you the ability to post content to a blog, message board, chat room or within our applications or other forums ("Forums"). In order to use the Forums, you must allow us to collect a user name and email address from you. Additionally, you may optionally provide a profile picture, your location and user names for instant messaging services (e.g. AIM, Skype, etc.). You may also choose to sign up with your Facebook account. If so, then we may collect your first and last name, your profile picture and other information made publicly available by you, as well as the email address associated with your account. This personal information may be combined with non-personal information you provide, such as your date of birth, interests, occupation and any other information you choose to contribute about yourself. 

You should be aware that any visitor to the Forums may read your postings on the Forums. Furthermore, any information that you may post to a Forum, including your username or other account profile information, will be disclosed and available to all users and viewers of that Forum, and therefore, will be no longer private. We cannot guarantee the security of such information that is disclosed or communicated online in public areas such as the Forums, and you provide such information at your own risk. We do not author, edit or endorse any Forum. You acknowledge and agree that we have no responsibility for the accuracy or availability of information provided on any Forum. We reserve the right at any time, in our sole discretion, to remove any content that a user may post on any Forum and restrict user access to any Forum. 

Social Media Interaction

You also can engage with our content on or through third-party social networking sites, such as Facebook and Twitter (or third-party social media plug-ins and applications). When you engage with our content on or through third-party social networking sites, plug-ins and applications, you may allow us to have access to certain information from your social media profile (e.g., name, e-mail address, photo, gender, birthday, location, your list of friends, people you follow and/or who follow you, the posts or the 'likes' you make) to deliver the content or as part of the operation of the application. We may also obtain non-personally identifiable information (e.g., content viewed, game performance, high scores, and information about advertisements within the content you have been shown or may have clicked on) from your interaction with our content. 

When you provide information from your social media account, it can help enable us to do things like (1) give you exclusive content, (2) personalize your online experience with us within and outside our Sites (and/or applications), and (3) contact you through the social networking sites or directly by sending you the latest news, special offerings, and rewards. By doing so, you consent to the use of this information in accordance with our Privacy Policy. When you provide personal information to us through an application, on our Sites, or on social networking sites, it may be publicly viewed by other members of these sites and we cannot prevent further use of the information by third parties. 

Through some social networking sites' privacy settings, you can control what data you share. For more information about how social networking sites handle your personal information, please refer to their privacy policies and terms of use. 

Customer Service

We may collect information that you provide to us, such as your name, email address and/or telephone calls with names and numbers to return calls when you contact our customer support and we may use that information to contact you about your gaming experience with our Game. 

Game Data Collection

We use this information to help improve your game experience and monitor the performance of the game. Please note that our third party service providers, later described, may have access to information such as your device identifier ("device ID"), advertising identifier ("ad ID"), MAC address, IMEI, locale (specific location where a given language is spoken), geo-location information, and IP address. In order for Tapjoy to function on older Android devices which do not have an ad ID, telephone number may be collected in order to create a unique ID.

A cookie is a small text file that we transfer to your computer and/or device, to identify a user's computer/device and to "remember" things about your visit, such as your preferences or a user name and password. Information contained in a cookie may be linked to your personal information for purposes such as improving the quality of our service, tailoring recommendations to your interests, and making the service easier to use. You can disable cookies at any time, although by doing so, you may not be able to access or use all of the features of the service. 

Advertising

From time to time, you may see our Game advertised in other services. After clicking on one of these advertisements and installing our Game, you will become a user of our Game. In order to verify the installs, a device ID may be shared with the advertiser. 

We may feature advertisements served by third parties that deliver cookies to your computer/device so the Content you access and advertisements you see can be tracked. Since the third party advertising companies associate your computer/device with a number, they will be able to recognize your computer/device each time they send you an advertisement. These advertisers may use information about your visits to our Site and third party sites and applications in order to measure advertisement performance and to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, the data collection practices of these third party advertisers, and we encourage you to check their privacy policies to learn more about their use of cookies and other technology.

_10\. California Residents: Your California Privacy Rights_

Under the laws of the State of California, California Residents who have an established business relationship with us may choose to opt out of our disclosure of personal information about them to third parties for direct marketing purposes. As detailed above, our policy is not to disclose personal information collected online to a third party for direct marketing purposes without your approval. If you choose to opt-out at any time after granting approval, email [support@rtsoft.com](mailto:support@rtsoft.com). 

Do Not Track Signals

In September 2013, California enacted amendments to the California Online Privacy Protection Act (California Business & Professions Code §§22575-22579) which require operators of websites to disclose how they respond to "do not track" (DNT) signals from browsers used by consumers or other mechanisms that provide consumers a choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about the consumer's online activities over time and across different websites or online services. While some newer browsers have incorporated "Do Not Track" features which, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the web sites you visit indicating that you do not wish your online activity to be tracked, a DNT protocol that can be implemented across multiple devices and sites has not yet been widely adopted. Currently, our computer system does not support, and cannot act on DNT signal headers that we may receive; accordingly, the choices that we provide you concerning our collection and use of personally identifiable information will continue to operate as described in this policy. 

For Minors

California residents under the age of 18 have the right to remove, or request the removal of, content or information they have posted to the Forums. This request can be made by emailing us at [support@rtsoft.com](mailto:support@rtsoft.com). Please again be advised that any information posted to the Forums is publicly viewable. We strongly recommend that all users avoid posting personal or sensitive information at any time. 

Please note that residual copies of User Content and/or information that have been deleted may remain on our backup servers. We are not required to remove posted User Content or information if it has been rendered anonymous or if we are required by law to retain it. Additionally, we do not have control over third parties (e.g., other users) who may have copied or reposted the User Content or information.
