**Notice to Residents of Countries outside of the United States of America**  
In order to provide information to you or to otherwise fulfil contractual arrangements that we have with you, we may need to appoint other organizations to carry out some of the data processing activities on our behalf.

These may include, for example, vendors who provide services for us such as payroll services, payment processing organizations, fraud prevention, or employment screening; to comply with legal orders and government requests, or as needed to support auditing, compliance, and corporate governance functions; if we are under a legal or regulatory duty to do so; if it is necessary to do so to enforce a contract with you; to lawfully assist the police with the prevention and detection of crime; where such disclosure is necessary to protect the safety or security of any persons, with your consent; and/or otherwise as permitted under applicable law.

**Collection of Data from Individuals’ Outside the United States and California**  
Please note that RTI is headquartered in the United States of America. If you are located outside the United States and provide your data to RTI, we will take proper steps to ensure that your information is protected in accordance with this privacy policy. In addition, RTI recognizes that the European Union has established a data protection policy effective May 25th, 2018 known as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This regulation applies to countries within the European Union (EU) and governs the transfer of data outside of the EU. In addition, Switzerland has also established a data protection regime pursuant to the Federal Act on Data Protection (“FADP”). These regimes restrict companies in the EEA and Switzerland (collectively, “EEA/CH”) from transferring personal data about individuals in the EEA/CH to the United States, unless there is “adequate protection” for such personal data when it is received in the United States. To create such “adequate protection” and allow our Vendors to overcome the restriction on international data transfers established by GDPR and the FADP, we adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy principles published by US Department of Commerce (“Safe Harbor Principles”) with respect to personal data about individuals in the EEA/CH that our subsidiaries and Business Partners in the EEA/CH send to us. More information on the Safe Harbor Principles and RTI’s scope of participation is available at <http://export.gov/safeharbor/>

If you reside in Canada, you may have the right to be provided with access to Personal I information that we have collected about you and written information about our policies and practices with respect to the transfer of your personal information to vendors outside Canada. To find out more, please email us at [listen@rti.org](mailto:listen@rti.org)

Pursuant to Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code, resident of California can obtain certain information about the types of personal information that companies with whom they have an established business relationship have shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year. The law provides that companies must inform consumers about the categories of personal information that have been shared with third parties, the names and addresses of those third parties, and examples of the types of services or products marketed by those third parties. To request a copy of the information disclosure provided by RTI pursuant to Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code, please contact us at [listen@rti.org](mailto:listen@rti.org) or the address stated above.
