**Collection of Information**

_Information You Choose to Submit_

“Personal Information” means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a home, business, or other physical address, a phone number, and an email address. We do not collect Personal Information from our Directory users unless you choose to share such information with us. For example, if you send us an email in connection with an inquiry about the Directory, we may collect and store your email address and other Personal Information provided by you in connection with that inquiry. In addition, you may be required to provide us with certain Personal Information to register with the Directory, sign up for certain services available through the Site and at other times. The decision to provide this information is optional; however, if you decide not to register or provide such information, you may not be able to use certain features of the Directory.

_Information We May Automatically Collect_

From time to time, we may collect general, non-personal, statistical information about the use of the Directory (“Non-Personal Information”), such as how many visitors visit a specific page on the Directory, how long they stay on that page and which hyperlinks, if any, they “click” on. We collect this information through the use of “cookies” and other tracking technologies, which are discussed in greater detail below. We may also automatically collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in log files may include your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider), the Web browser you used to visit the Directory, the time you visited the Directory, which Web pages you visited on the Directory, and other anonymous usage data.

_Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies_

Our Directory utilizes “cookies” and other tracking technologies that may be provided by ReachLocal or its third party partners. A cookie is a small file that often includes an anonymous unique identifier and that is sent to your browser from a Web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. ReachLocal uses “session cookies” which expire upon the conclusion of your visit to the Directory. These cookies facilitate your interaction with our Advertisers’ sites.

In addition, ReachLocal and its third party partners may also place cookies that will do the following (“Tracking Cookies”):

  * Track the areas of the Directory that you are visiting for the purposes of potentially showing you targeted advertising when you visit other Web sites.
  * Track the Business Listings that you are viewing within the Directory for the purposes of showing you advertisements from that same business or similar businesses when you visit other Web sites. 



You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie or to block cookies. However, if ReachLocal or its third parties have deployed Tracking Cookies, _simply because you have clicked the link to visit this Privacy Policy, ReachLocal has suppressed all of the functionality of the Tracking Cookies._ If, however, you return to the Directory, Tracking Cookies may be dropped again, which may be suppressed again by clicking the link to visit this Privacy Policy. Please be aware that some features of the Directory may not function properly or may be slower if you refuse or block cookies.

You should also be aware that if you click on a link in one of the Business Listings that is for one of our advertisers or click on one of our advertiser’s sites, a cookie may be placed on your computer that enables ReachLocal to serve advertisements for such advertiser when you visit other Web sites and to track the effectiveness of those advertisements. You will be able to have such cookies removed by clicking on the link to the Notice of Marketing Practices on the advertiser’s site. These cookies will be in addition to any other cookies or other tracking technologies that may be used by the advertiser, if any, which will be governed by the advertiser’s own privacy policy.

Please note that we do not link the information in the Tracking Cookies or any other cookie to your Personal Information, to the extent you provide us with any Personal Information. Moreover, as previously stated, we do not obtain, store or maintain any Personal Information about you through the use of cookies (either the session cookies or the Tracking Cookies).

**How We May Use Your Information**

If you provide us with Personal Information, we may retain and use that information to facilitate your inquiry or request and as otherwise described on this Privacy Policy. For example, we may use your Personal Information in order to respond to your questions or requests for information about ReachLocal or to communicate with you regarding the Directory or the services provided by ReachLocal, such as service announcements, e-mails related to the Directory, or similar administrative or transactional messages. 

We reserve the right to use Personal Information and Non-Personal Information to identify a visitor when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with the Directory’s policies, to protect the Directory, our customers, or others, or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.

**With Whom We May Share Your Information**

ReachLocal will not sell or share your Personal Information with any unaffiliated third parties for marketing purposes. We may sometimes use other businesses (“Service Providers”) to perform certain services for us, such as maintaining the Directory and our e-mail services and processing inquiries. We provide our Service Providers with the information reasonably necessary for them to perform the services on our behalf. Each Service Provider must agree to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information involved in order to protect your information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.

We may share Personal Information and Non-Personal Information with entities controlling, controlled by, or under common control with ReachLocal. In the event that ReachLocal is merged, sold, or in the event of a transfer of some or all of ReachLocal’s assets, we may disclose or transfer Personal Information and Non-Personal Information in connection with such transaction.

We may disclose aggregate Non-Personal Information in order to describe the use of the Directory to our existing or potential business partners, sponsors, advertisers, or other third parties, or in response to a government request. However, please be assured that this aggregate data will not involve the disclosure of Personal Information nor personally identify you or any other visitors to the Directory.

We reserve the right to disclose Personal Information and Non-Personal Information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, other visitors, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. We also reserve the right to disclose Personal Information and Non-Personal Information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.

**Links to Other Sites; Public Venues**

Please be aware that when you are on the Directory, you could be directed by clicking on hyperlinks to other sites that are beyond our control. For example, the Directory includes information regarding various local businesses, which may include links to their Web sites. These other Web sites may send their own cookies to visitors, collect data, or solicit Personal Information. The privacy policies of these other Web sites may be significantly different from this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other Web sites and cannot guarantee the security of any of your Personal Information collected there.

**Security**

The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We use standard security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information in an effort to protect information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect information transmitted on or through the Directory, we cannot and do not guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit on or through the Directory, and you do so at your own risk.

**Children’s Privacy**

This Directory is not intended for use by children under 13. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from anyone under 13 years of age. If we become aware that we have unknowingly collected Personal Information from a child under the age of 13, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to delete such information from our database.

**Governing Law**

This Privacy Policy shall be interpreted and governed exclusively under California law as set forth in the Terms of Use and, to the extent applicable, the laws of the United States. Visitors who use the Directory and reside outside the United States do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable. If you reside outside of the United States, by using our Directory, you consent to the transfer and use of your information, including any Personal Information, outside your country.

**Changes to Our Privacy Policy**

The terms of this Privacy Policy may change from time to time in ReachLocal’s discretion. We will notify you of any material changes to this Privacy Policy by posting a notice on the homepage of the Directory for a reasonable period of time after such changes are made that this Privacy Policy has been updated and by changing the “Last Modified” date at the top of this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to check this page periodically for any changes. Your continued use of the Directory following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.
