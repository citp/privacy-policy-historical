                        <p> </p>

At <span class="ring-color">ringID</span>, we obtain additional watchful measures to ensure that all the data we hold in our data center related to you is accurate, precise and secured. Valuable Information is stored on our servers and sheltered by safe networks which are subject to limited access to a few approved employees and personnel. However, it is to be noted that, any system of communication over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, cannot be considered as fully secured.</p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p>It is probable that you have downloaded the <span class="ring-color">ringID</span> application from our site or any other site. Furthermore, there are possibilities that our site may contain links which will make you attend some other website and leave our site. It is to be noted that websites which are linked to or from our site do not fall under the control of <span class="ring-color">ringID</span>   and they most likely will have a privacy policy which will be different than ours. Our policies apply exclusively to personal information that is collected on the site or by the means of your use of our service and/or your experience with <span class="ring-color">ringID</span>. We strongly suggest that you should be careful while you are providing any personal information online. For any other website we adhere to no responsibility or liability of any kind.</p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p>In this section, we look forward to clarify the facts regarding how <span class="ring-color">ringID</span> collects, stores and uses your data and the security measures taken to protect it.</p>

Each time you visit the Site or use the Service, you agree and expressly consent to our collection, use and disclosure of the information that you provide as described in this Policy.</p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p>To clarify about the terminology we are using, when we use the phrase "Personal Information" in this Policy, we mean information about you that is personally identifiable, like your name, address, e-mail address, billing information, or phone number, as well as other non-public information that is associated with this personal information. When we use the phrase "Anonymous Information" in this Policy, we mean information that is not personally identifiable, or linked to your Personal Information such as aggregated information, general demographic information and IP addresses. Anonymous Information does not necessarily enable identification of individual persons.</p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p>IF YOU ARE A USER ACCESSING THE SITE OR SERVICE FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION, ASIA, OR ANY OTHER REGION WITH LAWS OR REGULATIONS GOVERNING PERSONAL DATA COLLECTION, USE, AND DISCLOSURE THAT DIFFER FROM CANADA OR UNITED STATES LAWS, PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT THROUGH YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE SITE AND SERVICE, WHICH ARE GOVERNED BY UNITED STATES LAW, THIS PRIVACY POLICY, AND OUR END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT, YOU MAY BE TRANSMITTING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO COUNTRIES (INCLUDING CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION IN YOUR COUNTRY AND YOU HEREBY CONSENT TO SUCH TRANSMISSION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.</p>
                        <p></p><h2>1. Collection and Use of Information</h2><p></p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p><strong><span class="ring-color">ringID</span> App</strong></p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p>When you install the <span class="ring-color">ringID</span> App, you will be asked to provide us with your phone number and name and to allow us access to your mobile device's address book.</p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p>A copy of the phone numbers and names in your address book (but not emails, notes or any other Personal Information in your address book) will be stored on our servers and will only be used to:</p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p>(a) inform you when your contacts turn active on <span class="ring-color">ringID</span>,</p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p>(b) specify which of your contacts is already a <span class="ring-color">ringID</span> user,</p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p>(c) preciselyshow the name of every contact as it is in your address book when you receive a call.</p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p>(d) sync your contacts with <span class="ring-color">ringID</span> running on any other platform.</p>
                        <p>If you delete your address book which contains names and phones, from our servers, it will be deleted permanently straightaway. This is because the copy of your address book is stored on a live database which does not have a "historical backup".</p>
                        <p>Your phone number, which will be verified via a passcode that will be sent to you, will be used for identification purposes as your <span class="ring-color">ringID</span> user ID.</p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p>As other <span class="ring-color">ringID</span> users may add your <span class="ring-color">ringID</span> number to their address book and see that you registered to <span class="ring-color">ringID</span>, we do not consider the fact that your <span class="ring-color">ringID</span> number exists on <span class="ring-color">ringID</span> as private information.</p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p><span class="ring-color">ringID</span> also maintains a Call Detail Record (CDR - see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_detail_record) for each message and call that goes through the system. These are industry standard records used by all phone companies. We maintain this information in order to better understand network behavior and trends (numbers of messages and calls made by users, typical destinations, call lengths, network type, etc.), detect potential outages and technical issues (this helps us notice things like a drop in call volume in a certain geography, a shift in call length, a change in typical networks, etc.) and for public safety reasons. All log analysis is done in an anonymous, aggregate, non-personally identifiable manner. We may look into a specific Call Detail Record in response to a customer support request. We maintain CDRs for a period of no more than 30 months.</p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p>Audio calls by users are transmitted either directly from user to user or, if direct transmission is not possible (due to, for example, firewalls), <span class="ring-color">ringID</span> servers are used to transmit the call. In the latter scenario, the information transmitted is stored briefly in volatile memory (RAM) solely to enable the transmission of the call to the other user. WE DO NOT RECORD ANY PART OF YOUR CALL.</p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p>It might be necessary for <span class="ring-color">ringID</span> to interrelate with your phone's SMS inbox or call history for the lone purpose of service activation, placing incoming messages in your inbox, reading the contents of the activation SMS sent to you by <span class="ring-color">ringID</span>. WE WILL NOT ACCESS THE CONTENTS OF ANY OTHER SMS.</p>

                            <li>We receive your IP address and other related information you use to install <span class="ring-color">ringID</span> apps or to access <span class="ring-color">ringID</span>, including when multiple users log in from the same device. This may include network and communication information, such as your IP address or mobile phone number, and other information about things like your internet service, operating system, location, the type (including identifiers) of the device or browser you use, or the pages you visit. For example, we may get your GPS or other location information so we can tell you if any of your friends are nearby, or we could request device information to improve how our apps work on your device.</li>
                            <li>We receive data whenever you visit a game, application, or website that uses <span class="ring-color">ringID</span> Platform or visit a site with a <span class="ring-color">ringID</span> feature (such as a social plugin), sometimes through cookies.

                        <p> </p>
                        <p>We also put together data from the information we already have about you, your friends, and others, so we can offer and suggest a variety of services and features. For example, we may make friend suggestions, pick stories for your newsfeed, or suggest people to tag in photos. We may put together your current city with GPS and other location information we have about you to, for example, tell you and your friends about people or events nearby, or offer deals to you in which you might be interested. We may also put together data about you to serve you ads or other content that might be more relevant to you. </p>
                        <p>When we get your GPS location, we put it together with other location information we have about you (like your current city). But we only keep it until it is no longer useful to provide you services, like keeping your last GPS coordinates to send you relevant notifications. </p>

                        <p>We receive information about you from your friends and others, such as when they upload your contact information, post a photo of you, tag you in a photo or status update, or at a location, or add you to a Group. </p>
                        <p>When people use <span class="ring-color">ringID</span>, they may store and share information about you and others that they have, such as when they upload and manage their invites and contacts. </p>

                        <p><strong>Public information </strong></p>
                        <p>When we use the phrase "public information", we mean the information you choose to make public, as well as information that is always publicly available. </p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p><strong>Information you choose to make public </strong></p>
                        <p>Choosing to make your information public is exactly what it sounds like: anyone, including people off  <span class="ring-color">ringID</span>, will be able to see it. </p>
                        <p>Choosing to make your information public also means that this information: </p>
                        <ul><li>can be associated with you (i.e., your name, profile pictures, cover photos, timeline, User ID, username, etc.) even off <span class="ring-color">ringID</span>; </li>
                            <li>can show up when someone does a search on <span class="ring-color">ringID</span> or on a public search engine; </li>
                            <li>will be accessible to the <span class="ring-color">ringID</span>-integrated games, applications, and websites you and your friends use; and </li></ul>
                        <p>Sometimes you will not be able to select an audience when you post something. This is because some types of stories are always public stories. As a general rule, you should assume that if you do not see a sharing icon, the information will be publicly available. </p>
                        <p>When others share information about you, they can also choose to make it public. </p>

                        <p>Information that is always publicly available </p>
                        <p>The types of information listed below are always publicly available, and they are treated just like information you decided to make public: </p>
                        <ul><li><strong>Name: </strong></li>
                            <ul><li>This helps your friends and family find you. </li> </ul></ul>

                        <ul><li><strong>Profile Pictures and Cover Photos:  </strong></li>
                            <ul><li>These help your friends and family recognize you. If you are uncomfortable making any of these photos public, you can always delete them. Unless you delete them, when you add a new profile picture or cover photo, the previous photo will remain public in your profile picture or cover photo album.</li> </ul></ul>

                        <ul><li><strong>Networks:  </strong></li>
                            <ul><li>This helps you see who you will be sharing information with before you choose your audience. If you are uncomfortable making your network public, you can leave the network. </li> </ul></ul>

                        <ul><li><strong>Gender: </strong></li>
                            <ul><li>This allows us to refer to you properly.  </li> </ul></ul>

                        <p>(b) protect and defend our rights or property (including the enforcement of our agreements); or</p>
                        <p>(c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of our Service or members of the public.</p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p>In order to register with <span class="ring-color">ringID</span>, you will have to provide first name, last name, gender, cell phone number, username and password.

                        <p><span class="ring-color">ringID</span> will use your cell phone number to search other <span class="ring-color">ringID</span> users in the contact list and make friend suggestions. Moreover, acquisition of your cell phone number also verifies the identity of the user and helps to avoid any unapproved use of <span class="ring-color">ringID</span>.</p>
                        <p>Your phone book in your cell phone will be used to search other <span class="ring-color">ringID</span> users in your contact list and make friend suggestions.</p>

                        <p>The aforementioned information of the user will be kept such that it will be visible to other users. It is up to the sole consent of the user whether or not to submit the required information. However, non-submission of information might result in the prevention of using any of the <span class="ring-color">ringID</span> features or parts of it.  If a user account is deleted, such user information will be deleted as per the company policies. </p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p>In order to provide you with <span class="ring-color">ringID</span> products you have requested, <span class="ring-color">ringID</span> may sometimes, if necessary, share your Personal Information (excluding your address book and related information) and traffic data with trusted partner service providers and/or agents, for example: payment processors or other providers of payment and analytical services, customer support, or hosting services. <span class="ring-color">ringID</span> will always require these third parties to take appropriate organizational and technical measures to protect your personal data and traffic data and to observe the relevant legislation. <span class="ring-color">ringID</span> will never share your address book information with any third party, except as may be required by law .</p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p>The following is a description of how we may share your Personal Information with trusted third party partners. Should we add additional partners, we will immediately update this description:</p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p>1. We may use Push Notification Services to notify you about various events related to the app. If we do, the phone number or the name of the person calling you or sending you a message may be part of the notification. This message is sent to the push notification service provider, for delivery to your device.</p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p>2. We use third parties to process the payment and/or billing information that you submit on our Site or through the <span class="ring-color">ringID</span> App to facilitate payment transactions. We require that these third parties take the appropriate organizational and technical measures to protect your personal data and traffic data and to comply with relevant laws</p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p>We may disclose information about you if we determine that for national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance that disclosure of information is necessary.</p>
                        <p>We may from time to time ask you to provide information about your experiences, which will be used to measure and improve quality. You are at no time under any obligation to provide any of such data. Any and all information which is voluntarily submitted in feedback forms on the Site or any survey that you accept to take part in is used for the purposes of reviewing this feedback and improving the <span class="ring-color">ringID</span> software, products and websites.</p>
                        <p>We may contact you to send you messages about faults and service issues. Furthermore, we reserve the right to use email, the <span class="ring-color">ringID</span> software or SMS to notify you of any eventual claims related to your use of our software, websites and/or products, including without limitation claims of violation of third party rights.</p>
                        <p>We may send you alerts via the <span class="ring-color">ringID</span> software to notify you when someone has tried to contact you. We may also use the <span class="ring-color">ringID</span> software to keep you up to date with news about our software and products that you have purchased and/or to inform you about other <span class="ring-color">ringID</span> products and related information.</p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p><strong>How we use the information we receive </strong></p>
                        <p>We use the information we receive about you in connection with the services and features we provide to you and other users like your friends, and the developers that build the games, applications, and websites you use. For example, in addition to helping people see and find things that you do and share, we may use the information we receive about you: </p>
                        <ul> <li>as part of our efforts to keep <span class="ring-color">ringID</span> products, services and integrations safe and secure; </li>
                            <li>to protect <span class="ring-color">ringID</span>'s or others' rights or property; </li>
                            <li>to provide you with location features and services, like telling you and your friends when something is going on nearby; </li>
                            <li>to make suggestions to you and other users on <span class="ring-color">ringID</span>, such as: suggesting that your friend use our contact importer because you found friends using it, suggesting that another user add you as a friend because the user imported the same email address as you did, or suggesting that your friend tag you in a picture they have uploaded with you in it; and </li>
                            <li>for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research and service improvement. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>As you grant us the permission to use your information, it helps us to provide you with better service features and further improve our offerings for the future.
                            While you are allowing us to use the information we receive about you, you always own all of your information. Your trust is important to us, which is why we don't share information we receive about you with others unless we have:
                        </p>
                        <ul>

                            <li>received your permission; </li>
                            <li>given you notice, such as by telling you about it in this policy; or </li>
                            <li>removed your name and any other personally identifying information from it. </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Of course, for information others share about you, they control how it is shared.
                            We store data for as long as it is necessary to provide products and services to you and others, including those described above. Typically, information associated with your account will be kept until your account is deleted. For certain categories of data, we may also tell you about specific data retention practices.
                        </p>
                        <p>We may enable access to public information that has been shared through our services. </p>
                        <p>We may allow service providers to access information so they can help us provide services. </p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p><strong>Control each time you post </strong></p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p>Whenever you post content (like a status update, photo or check-in), you can select a specific audience, or even customize your audience. </p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p>It is highly recommended that you always think before you post. Just like anything else you post on the web or send in an email, information you share on <span class="ring-color">ringID</span> can be copied or re-shared by anyone who can see it. </p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p>Although you choose with whom you share, there may be ways for others to determine information about you. For example, if you hide your birthday so no one can see it on your timeline, but friends post "happy birthday!" on your timeline, people may determine your birthday. </p>
                        <p> </p>

                        <p>When you comment on or "love" someone else's story, or write on their timeline, that person gets to select the audience. For example, if a friend posts a Public story and you comment on it, your comment will be Public. Often, you can see the audience someone selected for their story before you post a comment; however, the person who posted the story may later change their audience. So, if you comment on a story, and the story’s audience changes, the new audience can see your comment. </p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p>Sometimes you will not see a sharing icon when you post something (like when you write on a Page's wall or comment on a news article that uses our comments plugin). This is because some types of stories are always public stories. As a general rule, you should assume that if you do not see a sharing icon, the information will be publicly available. </p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p><strong>Control over your timeline </strong></p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p>Whenever you add things to your timeline you can select a specific audience, or even customize your audience. </p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p>When you select an audience for your friend list, you are only controlling who can see the entire list of your friends on your timeline. Your friend list is always available to the games, applications and websites you use, and your friendships may be visible elsewhere (such as on your friends' timelines or in searches). </p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p>Similarly, if you choose to hide your gender, it only hides it on your timeline. This is because we, just like the applications you and your friends use; need to use your gender to refer to you properly on the site. </p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p>When you hide things on your timeline, like posts or connections, it means those things will not appear on your timeline. But, remember, anyone in the audience of those posts or who can see a connection may still see it elsewhere, like on someone else's timeline or in search results. You can also delete your posts or change the audience of content you post.</p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p>People on <span class="ring-color">ringID</span> may be able to see mutual friends, even if they cannot see your entire list of friends.
                            Some things (like your name, profile pictures and cover photos) do not have sharing icons because they are always publicly available. As a general rule, you should assume that if you do not see a sharing icon, the information will be publicly available.

                        <p> </p>
                        <p>To make it easier for your friends to find you, we allow anyone with your contact information (such as email address or telephone number) to find you through the <span class="ring-color">ringID</span> search bar as well as other tools we provide, such as contact importers - even if you have not shared your contact information with them on <span class="ring-color">ringID</span>. </p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p>You can choose who can look up your timeline using the email address or telephone number you added to your timeline through your privacy settings. . But remember that people can still find you or a link to your timeline on <span class="ring-color">ringID</span> through other people and the things they share about you or through other posts, like if you are tagged in a friend's photo or post.</p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p>Your settings do not control whether people can find you or a link to your timeline when they search for content they have permission to see, like a photo or other story in which you've been tagged. </p>

                        <p> </p>
                        <p>Once you share information with your friends and others, they may be able to sync it with or access it via their mobile phones and other devices. For example, if you share a photo on <span class="ring-color">ringID</span>, someone viewing that photo could save it using <span class="ring-color">ringID</span> tools or by other methods offered by their device or browser. Similarly, if you share your contact information with someone or invite someone, they may be able to use <span class="ring-color">ringID</span> or third-party applications or devices to sync that information. Or, if one of your friends has a <span class="ring-color">ringID</span> application on one of their devices, your information (such as the things you post or photos you share) may be stored on or accessed by their device. </p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p>You should only share information with people you trust because they will be able to save it or re-share it with others, including when they sync the information to a device. </p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p><strong>Your Own Feed</strong></p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p>Your own feed is your activity log where you can go to view most of your information on <span class="ring-color">ringID</span>, including things you've hidden from your timeline. You can use this to manage your content. For example, you can do things like delete stories, change the audience of your stories or stop an application from publishing to your timeline on your behalf. </p>
                        <p>When you hide something from your timeline, you are not deleting it. This means that the story may be visible elsewhere, like in your friends' News Feed. If you want to delete a story you posted, choose the delete option. </p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p><strong>What your friends and others share about you </strong></p>
                        <p>Links </p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p>Anyone can add a link to a story. Links are references to something on the Internet; anything from a website to a Page or timeline on <span class="ring-color">ringID</span>. For example, if you are writing a story, you might include a link to a blog you are referencing or a link to the blogger's <span class="ring-color">ringID</span> timeline. If someone clicks on a link to another person's timeline, they'll only see the things that they are allowed to see. </p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p>If you are linked to in a private space (such as a message or a group) only the people who can see the private space can see the link. Similarly, if you are linked to a comment, only the people who can see the comment can see the link. </p>

                        <p> </p>
                        <p>As described in the "What your friends and others share about you" section of this policy, your friends and others may share information about you. They may share photos or other information about you and tag you in their posts. If you do not like a particular post, tell them or report the post. </p>
                        <p> </p>

                        <p>Once you are in a Group, you cannot be added to a subgroup in that Group. You can always leave a Group, but it will not prevent others from adding you to it again. </p>
