# Privacy Policy | RingTV

**1\. PRIVACY**

SEP takes the issue of safeguarding the privacy and security of visitors to its Web site very seriously. SEP is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. SEP will not sell, share or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. SEP collects both personal and non-personal information of visitors to its Web site. SEP collects personal identifying information from visitors only if the visitor voluntarily submits such information to us. Certain non-personal information of visitors is recorded by the standard operation of SEP’s Internet Servers.

**2\. PERSONAL INFORMATION**

SEP collects information from its visitors at several different points on its Web site. Personal information collected usually consists of an individual’s name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and/or credit card information. This information is required only when an individual wishes to pursue a business relationship with SEP or its clients such as receiving product information, or purchasing products from online stores available through this Web site. SEP always uses industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving consumer data exchanged with its Web site. Once collected this information is stored in a secure, password-protected database that SEP keeps separate from its corporate Web site. This information will be provided to the extent necessary for credit card processors and/or banks, and those third parties necessary to process, package and deliver your order. SEP will not disclose this personal information to any unrelated third party except when a third party is helping us pursue the business relationship initiated by the individual that provided the personal information. Personal information does not include information that is collected anonymously (i.e., without identification of the individual user) or demographic information not connected to an identified individual (See “Non-Personal Information” below).

In accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, SEP makes no effort to secure personal information from children 13 years of age or younger. If we become aware that a child 13 years or younger age has submitted personal information, we will immediately delete that information and not disclose it to any third party, nor will we attempt to use it to further pursue a business relationship.

From time-to-time SEP requests information from visitors via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the visitor therefore has a choice of whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code and age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of SEP’s Web site, our print publications, as well as any products we may produce in the future.

From time-to-time SEP sends out promotional and informational communications relying on the personal identifiable information it has collected. You will have the option of indicating your desire to receive or not receive this type of communication at the time of your providing such information to SEP.

**3\. NO PERSONAL INFORMATION**

Current technology allows for tracking of other information originating from a user’s computer, Internet Service Provider, or another originating network component. This information includes a user’s IP address and domain information, as well as ‘cookie’ information.

With regard to IP address and domain information, SEP securely logs this data when a user visits our site. This information is only used to provide aggregate statistical information to help us keep the site functional and responsive, and to determine overall visitor usage patterns. This information is not utilized to try and identify specific individuals, or track an individual’s navigation through the site.

Our Web site does use ‘cookie’ information to help provide an enhanced functional system experience to those visiting the site. A ‘cookie’ is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user. While our site does use ‘cookie’ information, only specific ‘cookie’ data elements helpful for our site’s operation are accessed and utilized. We may use ‘cookie’ information to determine ways in which our Web site can be improved, but no personal identification information is included in such activities, and this information is not shared with any third party. If a user rejects the ‘cookie’ the user may still use the site.

**4\. CONTACT US**

This Web site is controlled and operated by SEP at 510 Township Line Road, Suite 130, Blue Bell, PA 19422. The phone number is 267-708-0948. If you have any questions regarding these Terms of Use and Privacy Policies, feel free to contact us.
