### 2.2.1 Purpose of Processing Personal Data

Consumers should be aware that in calling phone numbers issued by Ringba, they could be disclosing information that could make them personally identifiable to Ringba Users. The security and privacy protection implemented on Ringba’s platform does not cover this type of transfer or disclosure of personal information. Consumers calling a phone number that may be issued by Ringba and licensed to a Ringba User should be aware that they are making themselves personally identifiable by their phone number’s ‘Caller ID’ and that they are solely responsible for their actions while on the phone with whatever party they requested to speak with.

It is the User’s responsibility to ensure that collection and processing of data is done in accordance with applicable law. 

### 2.3.1 Inquiries

If you wish to inquire about your Personal Data that may have been collected in a phone call through Ringba, we recommend that you contact the entity that you called and spoke with. As Ringba is a Processor in this regard, it does not control the Personal Data used or stored from the call, but processes it on behalf of its User. 

### 2.4 Users

If you are a User of our platform only, and not just a Visitor then this section is relevant for you. 

### 2.4.1 General

In order to provide services to its Users, Ringba collects certain types of data from them. Furthermore, Ringba’s Users collect information from Consumers when call a number issued to a Ringba User. This section will describe how these two types of data are collected and used by Ringba as well as geographical differences that effect this policy. Data entered or transferred into Ringba by Users such as campaign names, target names, publisher names, sub-account information, etc., remains the property of the User and may not be shared with a third party by Ringba without express consent from the User. 

### 2.4.2 Collection of User Data

During a User’s registration and later on Ringba’s platform, they provide information such as name, company name, email, address, telephone, credit-card number and other relevant data.

Ringba Users can at any time access and edit, update or delete their contact details by logging in with their username and password to Ringba’s platform. Ringba Users may create more Users with different privilege levels within their account. It is the responsibility of the User that creates other User accounts, to choose the level of access each User should have. Once these new Users log into Ringba, they meet the definition of User in this policy. Ringba will not retain User data longer than is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or as required by applicable laws or regulations. 

### 2.4.3 Collection of Consumer Data

Users may issued phone numbers to be used on their behalf or by making them available to relevant businesses, organizations, and individuals.

Consumer data includes data from individuals who called a phone number issued by Ringba, ‘Caller ID’ numbers from Consumers who may have called, and meta-data collected by Ringba JavaScript in some cases.

The purpose of collecting Personal Data as part of a phone call will vary depending on the User, as set up by Ringba’s Users.
