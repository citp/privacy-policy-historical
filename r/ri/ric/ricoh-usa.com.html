                                        Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual,
                                        including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a home or other physical address
                                        and an email address or other contact information. On some of Ricoh's web sites,
                                        you can order products or services, make requests, and register to receive materials.
                                        The types of Personal Information collected on these pages include such things as
                                        name, contact and billing information, transaction, and credit card information.

                                        In general, you can visit Ricoh’s web pages without telling us who you are or revealing
                                        any Personal Information about yourself. If you choose not to provide the Personal
                                        Information we request, you can still visit most of Ricoh’s Site, but you may be
                                        unable to access certain features, offers, and services that involve our interaction
                                        with you.

                                        When you do provide us with Personal Information, we usually use it to respond to
                                        your inquiry, process your order or provide you access to specific information,
                                        services or offers. If you chose to have a relationship with Ricoh, such as a contractual
                                        or other business relationship, we will naturally continue to contact you in connection
                                        with that business relationship including providing you with information about other
                                        Ricoh products and promotions that may be of interest to you. We (or a third party
                                        on our behalf) may contact you about a Ricoh offer in support of your business needs
                                        or to conduct surveys to better understand our customers' needs.

                                        Examples include mailing information, maintaining databases, filling an order, providing

                                        Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons,
                                        Ricoh decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries.
                                        Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of Personal Information to prospective
                                        or actual purchasers, or receiving it from sellers. It is Ricoh’s practice to seek
                                        appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.
                                        <br>

                                        Information to any other third parties without your permission. Ricoh may, however,
                                        use your Personal Information to: (i) respond to duly authorized information requests
                                        of governmental authorities; (ii) comply with any law, regulation, subpoena, or

                                        Ricoh is committed to ensuring the security of your Personal Information. To prevent
                                        unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate
                                        use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial
                                        procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. In certain
                                        areas of our Sites, Ricoh uses industry-standard 128-bit SSL-encryption in conjunction
                                        with firewalls to enhance the security of data transmissions. SSL encryption is
                                        designed to make the information unreadable by anyone but us. This security measure
                                        is working when you see either the symbol of an unbroken key or closed lock (depending
                                        on your browser) on the bottom of your browser window. While we strive to protect
                                        your personal information, we cannot ensure the security of the information while
                                        it is in transit to us, and so we urge you to take every precaution to protect your
                                        Personal Information when you are on the Internet. We also suggest that you update
                                        your browser to the most current software/updates available, change your passwords
                                        often, use a combination of letters and numbers, and after transactions close your
                                        browser to ensure that no data can be collected once you leave our Site.
