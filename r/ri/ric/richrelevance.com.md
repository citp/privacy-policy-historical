## Our Services

#### Information Collection and Use

“Services Data” is data collected by us in order to allow us to provide the Services to you and to our customers that have entered into an agreement with us to provide Services (“Customers”). The Services Data is collected from your browser or directly from our Customers and includes information such as your IP address (which in certain instances may be truncated or rendered pseudononymous), a unique Customer ID number, the date and time of use of our Services, and your activity on Customers’ websites. We use Services Data to provide you Customer product and service recommendations and advertisements either on Customer websites or through Customer emails. In the future, we may decide to use Services Data to provide you such recommendations and advertisements through other forms of digital distribution.

“Personal Information” means individually identifiable information that would allow a party to identify you or to contact you (online or offline). This type of information may include, for example, your name, address, telephone number, or email address. Certain Customers of ours (such as our retail business partners) provide us email addresses that they have obtained from you with your consent for the sole purpose of enabling us to personalize emails from those Customers to you using our product recommendation services. Accordingly, we may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service but we will not disclose such Personal Information to any third party unless specifically and rightfully instructed or directed to do so by Customer, and will not otherwise share, disclose, rent, or sell any such Personal Information except as requested or directed by Customer or as we believe may be required by law or to otherwise protect our legal rights. Transfers to subsequent third parties, if any, are covered by the service agreements with our Customers. If you would no longer like to be contacted by one of our Customers that use our Services, please contact our Customer that you interact with directly.

 **EXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED COLLECTION AND USE OF EMAIL ADDRESSES, WE DO NOT COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH OUR SERVICES**

#### Cookies and Tracking Technology

Cookies or similar technologies are used by RichRelevance, Inc. and third party advertising exchanges that we use so that we may advertise our Customers’ products and services on Customers’ websites. “Cookies” are small data files that contain a string of characters that are sent to your computer browser from our servers when our Services are accessed. Cookies allow us to save your preference information to improve the quality of our Services and to allow Customers to offer you a better experience on their websites through more personalized recommendations and advertisements. These technologies are also used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis. The information we collect from cookies is only used in conjunction with your use of Services and is not shared by us with any third party.  **RICHRELEVANCE CANNOT AND DOES NOT USE COOKIES TO DETERMINE ANY INDIVIDUAL’S ACTUAL IDENTITY.**  Click [here](http://www.richrelevance.com/cookies/) for more information on the cookies we use as part of our Services.

We gather certain information automatically from our customers’ websites and store it in log files. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer the Services. We do not link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you.

#### Disable Cookies

You have the right to decide whether or not to accept cookies. By default, most Web browsers are set up to accept cookies. If you prefer not to receive cookies, you can set your browser to provide a warning and/or refuse the cookie. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in the browser. At any time you can delete cookies from your browser. If you disable cookies, please note that we may be prevented from providing personalized recommendations and advertisements to you.

#### Disclosure of Aggregated Information

We may disclose aggregated information about the use of Services to business partners, prospective investors, and others. Additionally, we may produce industry-standard traffic reports for assessing use of Services. This information cannot be traced back to you personally.

#### Information Gathered by Our Customers or Other Third Parties

Except for limited instances described above where Customers provide email addresses to us, RichRelevance does not come in contact with, and specifically disclaims any association with, any Personal Information collected by Customers from their consumer end users. Customers may include usernames in the user identification tags that they pass to us, but we have no control over such tags and use this information only as a database identifier.  An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate Personal Information should direct his query to our Customer (the data controller). If requested to remove Personal Information we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.

#### Security/Retention

We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information we process. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

We retain Services Data only for so long as it remains relevant to providing you with product recommendations and advertisements on our Customers’ Websites or to the extent permitted by law.

Our collection of Personal Information is limited to the receipt of email addresses from a few of our Customers. We will retain this Personal Information for as long as needed to provide services to our Customers. If you wish that we no longer use your Personal Information to provide you services contact us at [privacy@richrelevance.com](mailto:privacy@richrelevance.com?subject=RichRelevance%20Privacy%20Policy). We will retain and use your Personal Information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
