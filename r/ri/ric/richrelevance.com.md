#### Information Collection and Use

Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“NPII”) is data collected by us in order to allow us to provide the Services to you and to our customers that have entered into an agreement with us to provide Services (“Customers”). The NPII is collected from your browser or directly from our Customers and includes non-personally identifiable information such as your IP address, a unique Customer ID number, the date and time of use of our Services, and your activity on Customers’ websites and on third party websites that display advertisements of Customers’ products and services (“Publishers”). We use NPII to provide you Customer product and service recommendations and advertisements either on Customer and Publisher websites or through Customer emails. In the future we may decide to use NPII to provide you such recommendations and advertisements through other forms of digital distribution.

“Personal Information” means individually identifiable information that would allow a party to identify you or to contact you (online or offline). This type of information may include, for example, your name, address, telephone number, or email address. Certain of our Customers (such as our retail business partners) provide us email addresses that they have obtained from you with your consent for the sole purpose of enabling us to personalize emails from those Customers to you using our product recommendation services.  Accordingly, we will not disclose such Personal Information to any third party, unless specifically and rightfully instructed or directed to do so by Customer and will not share, disclose, rent, or sell any such Personal Information except as requested or directed by Customer or as we believe may be required by law or to otherwise protect our legal rights. **EXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED COLLECTION AND USE OF EMAIL ADDRESSES, WE DO NOT COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH OUR SERVICES.** ****

#### Cookies and Pixel Tags

“Cookies” are small data files that contain a string of characters that are sent to your computer browser from our servers when our Services are accessed. We use cookies in the delivery of recommendations and advertisements on Customers’ and Publishers’ websites. Cookies allow us to save your preference information to improve the quality of our Services and to allow Customers to offer you a better experience on their websites through more personalized recommendations and advertisements. The information we collect from cookies includes only NPII, is only used in conjunction with your use of Services, and is not shared by us with any third party. **RICHRELEVANCE CANNOT AND DOES NOT USE COOKIES TO COLLECT ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION.**

Pixel tags are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a Web page or other document. Pixel tags allow the third party who serves the pixel tag to set cookies on your browser and obtain NPII. We allow third party advertising exchanges to insert pixel tags in product recommendations we place on Customers’ websites so that we may advertise those Customers’ products and services on Publishers’ websites. These third parties can write and read their own cookies on your computer, just as if you had requested a web page from their websites. We are not responsible for, and do not have any control over, the privacy practices or the content of such third parties. For more information about how to “opt-out” of cookies from third party advertising exchanges, please[ click here.](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp)

#### Disable Cookies

Most Web browsers are set up to accept cookies. If you prefer not to receive cookies, you can set your browser to provide a warning and/or refuse the cookie. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in the browser. At any time you can delete cookies from your browser. If you disable cookies please note that we may be prevented from providing personalized recommendations and advertisements to you.

#### Advertising Opt Out

You may also opt out of our use of your NPII to determine what advertisements to show you on Publishers’ websites by clicking on the button below. Opting out will prevent us from providing you personalized advertisements based on your preferences. However, we will continue to collect your NPII as described above in “Information Collection and Use.” If you choose to opt-out by clicking on this button you will receive what is referred to as a “persistent cookie” that tells us not to recognize your browser. We must maintain the cookie on your browser in order to recognize you as having opted-out. You must opt-out again if you clear that cookie from your browser, use a different internet browser, or use a new computer to access the internet.

In our Customer agreements, we use commercially reasonable efforts to require that Customers, as data controllers (in the EU context), add statements or clauses to their privacy policies specifically describing their use of NPII for behavioral advertising. Further, we use commercially reasonable efforts to require that each Customer provide its end user consumers with information regarding the ability to opt-out of such use of the NPII as we have provided herein. RichRelevance is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative. You can learn more about the Network Advertising Initiative, as well as opt-out of our behavioral advertising product by [clicking here.](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp)

RichRelevance also adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising <http://www.aboutads.info/>.

#### Disclosure of Aggregated Information

#### Information Gathered by Our Customers

Except for limited instances described above where Customers provide email addresses to us, RichRelevance does not come in contact with, and specifically disclaims any association with, any Personal Information collected by Customers from their consumer end users. Customers may include usernames in the user identification tags that they pass to us, but we have no control over such tags and use this information only as a database identifier.

#### Security/Retention

We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information we process, including your NPII. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We retain your NPII only for so long as it remains relevant to providing you with product recommendations and advertisements or to the extent permitted by law. This retention period may be indefinite. We retain your NPII for use in connection with our RichRecs in advertising solution only for so long as it remains relevant to providing you with product recommendations and advertisements. This retention period will not exceed 2 years.  
Our collection of Personal Information is limited to the receipt of email addresses from a few of our Customers. We will retain this Personal Information for as long as needed to provide services to our Customers.
