# Rich Casino is a brand new Casino Running on the new TOP GAME Software Platform

[Home](https://web.archive.org/ "Casino") » Security & Privacy 

Rich Casino puts the fun back into online gaming, by making sure you feel safe and secure while playing. 

We are committed to operate in a legal and regulated environment. Furthermore, we take every security precaution; we have installed sophisticated technology to ensure that only players who are eligible are served. We deploy the most sophisticated technology available today including encryption and firewall technology to protect your security, your privacy and to ensure that you experience nothing but fair play. By using industrial grade encryption technology (1024 bit RSA key exchange and 448 bit Blowfish), we provide protection for your data at the highest level, much more than it would be possible with the more common commercial grade SSL protection. This same technology is being utilized by major financial institutions worldwide. 

All banking transactions are settled by international financial institutions with high standards of confidentiality and secure networks. Access to account information is also restricted by a player's unique sign in ID and password. 

We do not tolerate fraudulent activity on our site. Any such activity will result in immediate account termination, forfeiture of any winnings and may result in civil and/or criminal prosecution of the player. 

**At Rich Casino your protection is our priority.**
