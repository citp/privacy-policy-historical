# Privacy Policy

At Comark Inc. ("Comark") we value our customers and respect their privacy rights and concerns. This is the Internet Privacy Policy for Comark and the Comark Divisions – Ricki's, Bootlegger and cleo, in which we explain our purposes and policies for the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information.

### The Information We Collect

Comark collects information by various methods including information actively provided by its customers through our stores, websites and point of sale systems, for the following purposes: to contact you to subscribe to email newsletters, customer surveys, send you marketing material, enter contests, provide general feedback and apply for employment.  In addition, we collect information when processing sales, refunds and exchanges on-line and in our stores to help us prevent fraud as well. Where required under law, we ask you for your express consent and inform you as to why we are collecting this information at the time you provide it. Sometimes your consent can be implied (for example, non-sensitive information knowingly supplied by you to our website).

The types of personal information we may collect include your name, address, phone number, email contact information, and purchasing information. In the case of information that you provide to us in response to career postings, we treat this information separately as "employee personal information" and in accordance with applicable law.

### How We Use This Information

We collect personal information to establish and maintain responsible commercial relationships with our customers, to manage and develop our business and operations and to meet legal and regulatory requirements. Some examples, in addition to the other purposes set out under "The Information We Collect", include collecting and using personal information to contact you for marketing surveys to improve our customer offerings, and for soliciting customer service feedback to improve our ability to serve your needs.

### On-line merchandise sales, refunds and exchanges:

You will be asked to provide your payment information, address, and phone number to complete sales and delivery transactions or, in the case of refunds your original packing slip, for audit and fraud prevention purposes.

### Who We Share This Information With

Your personal information may be shared with our third party service providers for the processing of such information, and amongst Ricki's, Bootlegger and cleo as these are commonly owned and operated by Comark Inc. This would be done only for the purposes identified above. We do not share marketing and personal information with other third party companies.

### Security

Comark limits access to your information to those who need to use it for the purposes described above. All Comark Associates sign a more detailed Privacy Policy on hire and annually thereafter. We protect your information with security tools appropriate for the nature of the information. We keep this information only for as long as is required to fulfill its purpose or to meet our other legal requirements.

### On-line purchases:

Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") technology is used to protect the security of your credit card information as it is transmitted. SSL is the industry standard for secure commerce transactions. It is designed to prevent your personal information from being read by someone else as it travels across the Internet. All of your personal information is encrypted, including credit card number, name and address.
