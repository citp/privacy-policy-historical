# Ricoh-USA - Privacy Policy

RICOH recognizes the importance of personal Data. Therefore, RICOH exerts its best efforts to pay attention to protection of your privacy on The RICOH Web Site and strongly adheres to the following policies. 

**Privacy statement Version 1.1 - December 2002**

Ricoh is committed to protecting your privacy and to technology that gives you the most powerful and secure online experience with the Ricoh Corporation Web Site (the "site"). You can travel through most of the Site without giving us any information about yourself. But sometimes we do need information to provide services that you request. This policy outlines our personal information handling practices. If you give us personal information, we will treat it according to this policy. 

Our policy regarding the safeguard of your information when collected is consistent with the five privacy principles of Fair Information Practices and the U.S. - E.U. Safe Harbor standards. 

**Principles: Awareness, Choice, Accuracy and Access, Security and oversight (Enforcement).**

**Awareness**

Ricoh publishes an Online Privacy Statement to make you aware of our privacy policy, practices and of the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. 

**Choice**

Once you have chosen to provide Ricoh with personal information, meaning any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, email address, a home, postal or other physical address, other contact information, title, birth date, gender, occupation, industry, personal interests, other information when needed to provide a service you requested, Ricoh will maintain that information. 

Ricoh will not sell, rent, or lease your information to others. Unless we have your permission or are required to do so by law, we will only share the personal data you provide with other Ricoh entities and/or business partners who act on our behalf for the uses described in "how we use it". These other entities and/or suppliers, may include those in the United States and/or any other countries, and are bound by the appropriate confidentiality and data protection agreements. 

**Accuracy & Access**

In certain areas of the Site access is limited and requires the use of a password or may require you to provide personal data. In those areas, Ricoh makes every effort to keep your personal information accurate and up to date. To protect your privacy and security, we may take reasonable steps to verify your information by using that information to contact you. Allow you access to your information via a web page, so that you may view, update or correct your information. We will provide you a set of instructions on that web page and also allow you to opt-out of the agreement, contract, provide your name, email and/or address and relevant information about subscriptions or registrations you may have with Ricoh. This opt-out function will also enable you to cancel all marketing and support communications and newsletters, including software driver subscriptions.

To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. As part of real-time payment processing, Ricoh uses 128 bit encryption and SSL (Secure Socket Layer) certificates when collecting or transferring sensitive data such as credit card information. The service gives you an extra level of protection to guard against credit card fraud. This secure data transfer and validation process ensures the highest level of security available. You are invited to visit the area outlined "data security" to learn more.
