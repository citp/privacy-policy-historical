# Privacy Policy | Ricoh USA

All the Information Ricoh collects about you may be combined to improve our communications with you, and to develop world-class products and services.

Information we collect from you allows us to communicate with you, process your orders or provide you with services.  You may provide us with Information in the course of ordering products or services, making requests, registering to receive materials or performing other activities. This information we collect may include Personal Information, such as your name, contact and billing information, transaction, and credit card information. If you are applying to a job at Ricoh, we may ask you to provide information such as educational background, employment experience, and job interest.

In general, you can visit Ricoh’s web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself. If you choose not to provide the Personal Information we request, you can still visit most of Ricoh’s Site, but you may be unable to access certain features, offers, and services that involve our interaction with you.

When you do provide us with Personal Information, we usually use it to respond to your inquiry, process your order or provide you access to specific information, services or offers. If you chose to have a relationship with Ricoh, such as a contractual or other business relationship, we will naturally continue to contact you in connection with that business relationship including providing you with information about other Ricoh products and promotions that may be of interest to you. We (or a third party on our behalf) may contact you about a Ricoh offer in support of your business needs, to conduct surveys to better understand our customers' needs or for other purposes that Ricoh deems appropriate.

Please note that Personal Information collected about you may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Ricoh or its subsidiaries, affiliates, agents or partners maintain facilities, and by using this website, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.

**Non-Personal Information**

We may also collect non-personal information including data about products and services that is not associated with a specific personal identity. For example, we may also ask you to provide us with information regarding your interests, demographics, and experiences with our products or services. Providing this additional information is optional. This information may be used to personalize our websites, services or communications and improve our products and services. We may also gather information about your usage of our website, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type and language, location information and pages visited, through the use of cookies or other automated technology such as web beacons.  We collect this information to track metrics about our Site and personalize your experience to our Site.   
**  
Use of cookies**

When you view one of our Sites, we, or one of our third party service providers, may store data on your device in the form of a "cookie" to automatically recognize your computer next time you visit. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device by websites that you visit. They are widely used in order to make websites work efficiently and to provide information to the owners of the site. Cookies can allow us to tailor a website to better match your interests or remembering your preferences and generally improving your browsing experience.  A web beacon is an electronic image that can be used to recognize a cookie on your computer or other device when you view a web page or email. If you prefer not to receive cookies while browsing our Site, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can make some web beacons unusable by disabling cookies. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser, although you may not be able to take full advantage of the Ricoh Site if you do so.  
**  
Use of information**

In addition to the uses described above, Ricoh, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to help us deliver programs, products, information, and services. When we retain another non-affiliated company to perform a function of this nature, we seek to provide them with only the information that they need to perform their specific functions.  We also take reasonable steps to ensure that these third-party service providers are obligated to protect Personal Information that is provided to them.

Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, Ricoh decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in the United States or another country. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of Personal Information to prospective or actual purchasers. It is Ricoh’s practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.

Except as provided in this Notice, Ricoh will not sell, rent or lease your Personal Information to any other third parties without your permission. Ricoh may, however, use your Personal Information to: (i) respond to duly authorized information requests of governmental authorities; (ii) comply with any law, regulation, subpoena, or court order; (iii) help prevent fraud or (iv) to enforce or protect the rights and properties of Ricoh or its affiliates.

This site makes use of Google Analytics features, including remarketing, userIDs and demographic reporting. We use this information to:

If you would like to know more about how Google uses data generated from use of our sites, [click here for more information](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/). If you would like to opt out of these features, you can do so by [installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).

**Accuracy and access**

Ricoh respects your desire that your Personal Information be accurately maintained. At your request, we will allow you access to your Personal Information so that you may view, update or correct it. To protect your privacy and security, we may take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your data.  
**  
Security**

Ricoh is committed to ensuring the security of your Personal Information. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. In certain areas of our Sites, Ricoh uses industry-standard 128-bit SSL-encryption in conjunction with firewalls to enhance the security of data transmissions. SSL encryption is designed to make the information unreadable by anyone but us. This security measure is working when you see either the symbol of an unbroken key or closed lock (depending on your browser) on the bottom of your browser window. While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure the security of the information while it is in transit to us, and so we urge you to take every precaution to protect your Personal Information when you are on the Internet. We also suggest that you update your browser to the most current software/updates available, change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers, and after transactions close your browser to ensure that no data can be collected once you leave our Site.

**Children and privacy**

Ricoh does not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13 and Ricoh does not target the Site to children under 13.

**Links to Third-Party Sites and Social Media**

Links to third party web sites and social media from our pages are provided solely as a convenience to you. If you use these links, you will leave the Ricoh Site. Ricoh does not control these third party sites and we encourage you to read the privacy policy of every site you visit. RICOH HAS NOT REVIEWED ALL OF THESE THIRD PARTY SITES AND DOES NOT CONTROL NOR IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY OF THESE SITES, THEIR CONTENT OR THEIR PRIVACY NOTICE. RICOH DOES NOT ENDORSE OR MAKE REPRESENTATIONS ABOUT THEM, OR ANY INFORMATION, PRODUCTS OR MATERIALS FOUND THERE, OR ANY RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM USING THEM. IF YOU DECIDE TO ACCESS ANY OF THE THIRD PARTY SITES LINKED FROM THE RICOH SITE, YOU DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK.
