# Privacy Policy | Rick Steves' Europe | ricksteves.com

All of us at Rick Steves' Europe, Inc. respect your privacy. We will never share your name, address, email address or purchase information with any third party, ever. Period.

When you place an order with us, we collect basic information including your name, address, email address and phone number. We use this information to confirm your order and to respond to any questions you may have.

We also provide security to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the customer data that we collect. When you shop at our website your information is protected by a firewall and the use of SSL encryption of your credit card information. See [Secure Ordering and Privacy](https://web.archive.org/travel-help/shop-online-faq) for more details.

We track "passive" information on customers' browsing behavior, but never on an individual level. We analyze this information strictly in aggregate terms to ensure our site is structured in a user-friendly way for our customers.

Acceptance of cookies is not a requirement to browse the content of our website, but our e-commerce applications require the acceptance of cookies to keep track of the items in your shopping cart and to complete an order (if items will not stay in your cart, see "[How to Enable Cookies](https://web.archive.org/about-us/how-to-enable-cookies)"). We never use cookies to store sensitive customer information such as names, addresses, passwords or credit card numbers. If you would like to place an order, but cannot (or choose not to) allow cookies, you may request a mail-in order form by contacting [Customer Service](https://web.archive.org/forms/contact-customer-service).

This privacy policy applies to the Rick Steves' Europe website and Rick Steves Audio Europe app.
