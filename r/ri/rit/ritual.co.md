We also collect information about you from other sources described below. We also look at how visitors use our Website to help us improve our Service and optimise customer experience.

In general, we collect information:

  * when you create an account with us or you change your account settings;
  * when you place an order with us and during the order process; and
  * when you browse and use our Website and App and in-store devices.



We also collect information from third party sites, such as advertising platforms and social networking sites.  

Information we collect from you:

Ritual collects personal information to deliver our Service to you, including through our Website and App. We collect personal information from you, such as:

  * Ritual collects location information when our App is running in the foreground (i.e. when you are actively using the App). If our App is running in the background, we will only collect your location information when it is required for the fulfilment of your order. For example, if you have an order in progress. Our geo-location tracking will stop once your order is complete.

How We Use Your Personal Information

We may use your personal information for the purposes communicated to you at the time of collection or as otherwise stated in the [Terms of Use](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ritual.co/terms&sa=D&ust=1562968365292000), including:

  * Provide our Service to you: Ritual uses the information we collect to provide, maintain, personalize, and improve our Service.



We will use your personal information to:

  * Create and manage your account. This includes using your phone number or email address to verify your identity.  

  * Show you Restaurants near you. We use your location to allow you to view the Restaurants in your area. Your location also allows us to provide a walk distance and to determine when an order should be placed.  

  * Facilitate order fulfilment and pick up. If you place an order via Ritual, your order and profile information is shared with our Restaurant partner for the purpose of fulfilling your order in accordance with our contract with you. This includes a photo, if you have chosen to upload one. The Restaurant that is fulfilling your order uses this photo to verify your identity. The Restaurant may also receive information about your company and team, if you have chosen to join a team.  

  * Facilitate payments through our payment provider.  

  * Enable the various features of our product for our legitimate interests (further discussed below) where we have considered that these are not overridden by your rights. For example, personalization or sharing features. Personalization features may include showing you recommendations while content features include allowing you to share reviews, ratings, tags, and discussions.  

  * Troubleshoot software bugs and operational problems.  

  * If you upload a photograph to your profile, your photograph will be used by the merchant to identify you. This may include having your photograph visible on our in-store device when your order is ready for pick up. 


  * Teams and other group ordering features: We use your team information to facilitate your order, provide relevant suggestions to you and others on the team/group, and to personalize your experience. We may also notify you of team members who you are most closely associated with, team photos, team posts and discussion, and other details about how your team interacts. We may give your team the ability to assemble in groups that would be visible by other team members. When you offer to pick-up for your team/group, Ritual will send your offer to your team/group using one or more channels including, but not limited to, in-App offers, push notifications, posts to team collaboration software or social networks.


  * Joining a team or a group is easy and open to anyone. When you join, all members will be able to see certain basic information, such as your first name and last initial, photo, and team/group affiliation (which may include company name and floor). Ritual may also notify your team/group that you have joined the team.


  * User content and communication: Ritual may use content you submit such as ratings, comments, or photos, to make recommendations to other Users and to facilitate the operations of our business. Ritual may also allow Users to communicate with others on their team or with Restaurants. These messages, should you choose to participate, may be accessible by members of your team or Restaurants and by us. Ritual may also allow Restaurants to communicate with users. For example, a Restaurant may contact you directly if there is a problem with your order.


  * Payment Information: When you register as a User, your credit card information is provided to a third-party payment processing provider in order to process payments for your orders. Ritual only stores the last four digits of your credit card number, the credit card type, the expiration number, your postal or zip code and the country. We use this information to prevent fraud. Information that you supply to our payment processing provider is not within our control and is subject to the provider's own [privacy policy and terms and conditions](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://stripe.com/en-ca/privacy&sa=D&ust=1562968365296000). We may change our payment processing providers from time to time and will update this Privacy Policy to reflect such changes.


  * Research and development: Ritual may use your personal information for testing, research, analysis, and development of our Services. This allows us, for our legitimate interests, to improve our Service improve the in store experience our merchants offer, and to determine where we should offer or focus our Service. We may share this information with third parties for industry analysis and statistics.


  * User support: We use your profile, account, and usage information to assist you when you contact User support. This allows us to direct your inquiry appropriately, investigate and assist you with your inquiry, and follow up to ensure the problem does not persist. We may also use your information to monitor and improve our User service responses.


  * We may also use your real-time geo-location information to address User or Restaurant support, technical, or business issues that may arise in the course of your use of the App. If you contact Ritual User service while an order is in progress, and it is necessary to use your real-time geo-location information to address your question, our support personnel will seek your consent before consulting your location.


  * Communications from Ritual: Ritual uses your contact information to communicate with you about your activity, our Service, your account, and, if we have your prior consent, about Ritual news, special offers, and events. We may also contact you about studies and surveys, if you have permitted us to do so.


  * If you have placed an order through the App, we may send you push notifications to your mobile phone to let you know the ongoing status of your order. If you do not want to receive push notifications, you can always withdraw your consent by changing your settings via the settings page of your mobile device.


  * If an issue arises while processing your order (e.g. if a café has run out of skimmed milk and you ordered a skinny latte), Ritual may contact you via text message to alert you to the issue. Standard text message and data rates may apply. If you wish to stop receiving text messages from Ritual, respond to a text message with the word ‘STOP’.


  * We may also need to communicate with you about your account or Ritual’s Service. For instance, we may send you an email to verify your username and password or let you know when our Service is temporarily suspended for maintenance.
