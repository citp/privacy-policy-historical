						<strong>Our Commitment to Privacy</strong>
						<br>Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on every page on our web site and every point where personally identifiable information may be requested. 
						<br><br><strong>The Information We Collect</strong>

						<br><br>To order prints, gifts and additional storage space, you will be further required to provide your mailing address, billing name and address, credit card number, and expiration date. 
						<br><br>You have the option to indicate on the registration form if you would like to receive promotional information as well as updates on new products and services from ritzPIX.com via email.

						<br><br>Certain announcements concerning ritzPIX.com site operation and service updates are crucial to site functionality, and will be sent to all registered users.
						<br><br>When you enter a sweepstakes or contest, we may ask for your name, address, and email address so we can administer the contest and notify the winner(s). This information is not used for any other purpose and is not shared with outside parties. 
						<br><br>When you share an album or send an online postcard to a friend, we ask for their name and email address. You also have the option to include a personal message to send to a friend.
