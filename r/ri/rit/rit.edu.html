  <p>As a general principle, you voluntarily provide us with your
    personal data. However, in certain circumstances we are required to collect
    certain personal data for legal purposes, for example because this personal
    data is required to be able to complete a contractual relationship, including

    as, but no limited to, administering your application/enrollment, assign

    services offered in connection with your studies or other interactions with RIT.</p>
  <h3>How long do we store personal data?</h3>
  <p>If you are an EU resident, RIT will delete your personal
    data when it is no longer reasonably required for business purposes or you
    withdraw your consent (where applicable), provided that we are not legally required
    or otherwise permitted to continue storing such data. RIT will not delete your
    personal data where it may be retained for the public interest, scientific or
    historical research purposes or statistical purposes. Please refer to our data
    retention policies for further details. </p>
