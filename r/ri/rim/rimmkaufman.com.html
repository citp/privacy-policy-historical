We use these data for research and development, system tracking, and helping visitors reach the right page. We use these data ourselves, and we share aggregated data with our clients.

The browser then returns that information to the Web server. This is how some Web pages "remember" your previous visits; for example, an e-commerce site might use a cookie to remember which items you've placed in your online shopping cart. Cookies can also store user preference information, log-in data, etc. Cookies let sites provide you with tailored information. </p><h2>Links to other sites</h2><p> Our sites link to and redirect to third-party websites.

We use strong encryption to keep these data safe from loss, tampering, misuse, and unathorized access. </p><p></p><h2>Policy changes</h2> Should we modify our privacy policy, we'll update this page accordingly. <p> If we make changes to our policy, we'll treat previously collected data in accordance with our policy in effect when the data were collected. </p><h2> Individuals under 13 years of age </h2> We're strongly committed to protecting the on-line privacy of kids. In accordance with the Children's On-line Privacy Protection Act, we do not collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. Our firm does not market to children, nor do we provide any services to children. <h2> P3P: Platform for Privacy Preferences </h2><p>Our privacy policy is available in machine readable format for browsers supporting P3P in <a href="policy1.xml">XML</a> and <a href="cpp.html">compact</a> form.</p><p> For more info, visit <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/p3pdeployment">http://www.w3.org/TR/p3pdeployment</a>. </p><h2> Acceptance of this privacy policy </h2> By using this site, you're indicating you've read and accept our privacy policy.
