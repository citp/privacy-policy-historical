# Utah Transit Authority

  * [Security & Privacy Policy](http://www.rideuta.com/mc/?page=SecurityAndPrivacyPolicy)



## Security & Privacy Policy

The Utah Transit Authority (“UTA”) respects your right to privacy and does not sell the information we gather to other organizations or governmental agencies. UTA is committed to protecting your privacy.  Our privacy policy statement is an important part of our continuing commitment to provide you with the best service.  This privacy policy statement explains our online data collection and use practices with respect to our online site (the “Site”).  By accessing the Site, you are consenting to the information collection and use practices described in this privacy policy statement.

**Collection of Information**

UTA collects two different categories of information on the Site for two different purposes.  First, the Site may collect certain information about your visit, such as the name of the Internet service provider and the Internet Protocol (IP) address through which you access the Internet; the type of browser and operating system used to visit the Site; the date and time you access the Site and which portions of the Site you visit; the pages that you access while at the Site and the Internet address of the Web site from which you linked directly to our Site.  UTA does not use the information automatically collected to ascertain your personally identifiable information.  This information is used to help improve the Site, analyze trends and administer the Site.  Except where specified on the Site, you do not have to provide personally identifiable information to visit or download information from the Site. Unless you choose to make your personally identifiable information available to us, UTA does not collect such information from you.

Second, we may gather certain personally identifiable information you disclose to us when you use services available on the Site.  For example, when you contact us by e-mail or join UTA’s mailing list, we may collect your first and last name, your e-mail address, your telephone number and any other personally identifiable information you disclose so we can provide you with the very best in customer service.   In addition, when you subscribe to one of UTA’s other electronic services, such as UTA My Way, you must create a password for managing your account.  You may also provide your address, telephone number and organizational affiliation.  If you apply for employment through the Site, we will collect personally identifiable information, such as your first and last name, your address and other employment related information.  Additional personally identifiable information which you may choose to make available to us may include, without limitation, social security number, credit card information, account numbers, bank account information, or any combination of personal information that could be used to determine identity will be collected. 

**No Spamming or “Phishing”**

Under no circumstances will UTA contact you via spam or mass e-mail or telephone to obtain personally identifiable information.  UTA may contact you via e-mail regarding a specific inquiry you make or to conduct other general surveys. 

**Use of personally identifiable information**

The personally identifiable information collected on this Site will be used to operate the Site and to provide the service(s) or carry out the transaction(s) you have requested or authorized.  In support of these uses, UTA may use personally identifiable information to provide you with more effective customer service, to improve the Site and any related UTA products or services, and to make the Site easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information or by customizing the Site to your particular preference or interest.  In order to offer you a more consistent experience in your interactions with UTA, information collected online may be combined with information collected by other UTA services.

UTA hires other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as web site construction and maintenance and information distribution. This privacy policy statement does not cover any third-party sites, including any third-party sites that may, from time to time, be linked to the Site or used to host specific pages on the Site.  We will only provide these companies the personally identifiable information they need to deliver the service.  They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

UTA may disclose personally identifiable information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law or comply with legal process served on UTA or the Site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of UTA; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of UTA employees or agents, users of UTA products or services, or members of the public.

Personally identifiable information collected on the Site may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which UTA or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using the Site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. 

Please be aware that this privacy policy statement and any choices you make on the Site will not necessarily apply to personally identifiable information you may have provided to UTA in the context of other, separately operated, UTA products or services.

UTA will not deliberately disclose any personally identifiable information provided by or collected from you to any third party except as set forth above.  It is UTA’s policy not to accept information from other parties that is confidential or proprietary unless subject to a written agreement.  If you wish to retain the confidentiality of your material, do not submit it to us in any form unless subject to a written agreement.  UTA may reproduce, disclose, transmit, broadcast or otherwise use any unsolicited ideas, without any obligation to compensate you.

**Data security and quality**

UTA is committed to data security and the data integrity of personally identifiable information available from or collected on the Site.  UTA has taken precautions to protect personally identifiable information from loss, misuse, or alteration.  Any authorized third parties responsible for this information are committed to the same principles, and are required by contract to follow the same policies and guidelines as UTA in protecting this information.  You should be aware, however, that even though protections are in place, UTA cannot guarantee against the occurrence of hardware failure, unauthorized intrusion, or other technical problems.

The ordering pages at the Site that ask you for sensitive personally identifiable information are highly secure. Our secure servers protect your information using encryption throughout the ordering process.  UTA uses a standardized universal Internet technology called Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption in connection with certain personally identifiable information collected on the Site.  When you send information from your computer to our servers at the Site it is encrypted (locked) so that the information is protected during its transmission.  Most browsers will show a lock icon in the bottom status bar on secure pages.  Look for this icon on the web pages that ask for credit card or other sensitive information.   

**Procedures for Access to view or correct personally identifiable information**

Unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law or regulation, an individual may access and correct personally identifiable information whether or not the inaccuracy was created by accident, unauthorized access, or a change in circumstances.  UTA also reserves the right to use any legally appropriate measures to prevent, monitor, and investigate any attempt to deface, delete, or otherwise tamper with or abuse the Site, servers, databases, information systems, or other UTA technology assets.  For additional information with respect to your personally identifiable information or to access or correct your personally identifiable information, please contact us.

**Changes to privacy policy statement**

UTA reserves the right to change this privacy policy statement at any time to reflect changes in its business practices.  If UTA elects to change its business practices in a way that implicates this privacy policy statement, such changes will be promptly reflected on the Site.
