# RideGuru - Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy, effective May 25, 2018, applies to all of the products, services and websites offered by Unleashed, LLC or our subsidiaries or affiliated companies.

On May 25, 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), a data protection and privacy regulation concerning the collection, use and processing of personal information of individuals in the European Union (“EU”), will go into effect.  The GDPR replaced the 1995 Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC).  It applies to all companies which collect and process data of EU residents.  This Privacy Policy has been updated to reflect the changes and improvements Unleashed, LLC has made in response to the mandates of the GDPR. 

##  **Information Collection and Use**

According to the European Commission, "personal data is any information relating to an individual, whether it relates to his or her private, professional or public life. It can be anything from a name, a home address, a photo, an email address, bank details, posts on social networking websites, medical information, or a computer’s IP address."[1]  Personal Information includes but is not limited to identifiers such as an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of a person.  We do not consider information that has been anonymized, aggregated or encrypted so that it can no longer be used to identify a specific person or non-personal or device-level information to be personal information.  To the extent Unleashed, LLC collects personal information, we require your explicit consent in order to process the data and provide Unleashed, LLC’s services, which you may withdraw at any time by sending a request to Unleashed, LLC, Attn:  Legal Department (Privacy Policy), 15 Walden Street, Concord, MA 01741.  Absent explicit consent, Unleashed, LLC is authorized to collect and process personal information about you when the processing is necessary to perform a contract with you, like the Terms of Service or in furtherance of Unleashed, LLC’s legitimate business interests, such as in improving, personalizing, and developing the services, marketing new features or products that may be of interest, and promoting safety and security as described herein.
