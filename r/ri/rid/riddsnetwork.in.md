# Privacy Policy

Riddsnetwork.in very strongly believes in it’s Privacy Policy. We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We only have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give us via email or other direct contact from you. We will not sell or rent this information to third parties. Unless you ask us not to, we may occasionally contact you via email in the future to tell you about specials, new products or services, or changes to this privacy policy.

  * ### Security:




We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.

Sensitive information such as credit card data are collected through trusted vendors like Google Checkout or Cc Avenue. Appropriate measures are taken by them to encrypt the data. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for “https” at the beginning of the web-address when you are in the process of transaction.

While encryption is used to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline.

The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment behind a hardware firewall.
