        In order to operate the Site and to provide you with information about 
        products or services that may be of interest to you, we may collect "personal 
        information" (i.e. information that could be used to contact you 
        directly (without using the Site) such as full name, postal address, phone 
        number or email address), "financial information" (i.e. credit 
        card numbers or passwords) or "demographic information" (i.e. 
        information that you submit, or that we collect, that is neither personal 
        information nor financial information; this may include, but is not limited 
        to, zip code, hometown, gender, username, age/birth date, 
         browsing history information, searching 
        history information, and registration history information. Demographic information is divided into 
        two categories: 1) "non-public information", which consists 
        of ride transaction information and one-on-one communications between 
        you and other users of the Site; and 2) "public information", 
        which consists of all other demographic information. We ask that you do 
        not enter personal information or financial information into your “Profile” 
        (for example, don’t use your address, real name, or passcode as your user id, 
        or include your name or address anywhere on the site), because if 
        you do then the information 
        will be treated as "demographic information" that is "public 
        information." Please note that nowhere on the Site do we knowingly 
        collect personal information from children under the age of 18, as we 
        require that all users represent to us that they are at least 18 years 
        old. </p></td>

        fit other user’s requirements, and to communicate with you. We may

        interests. We may also share demographic information with advertisers 
        on an anonymous and aggregated basis (i.e., without telling the advertisers 
        your identity). One of the reasons we may do this is to increase the likelihood 
        that our advertisers’ goods and services will appeal to you as Ridester 
        user. Our sharing of demographic information with advertisers is anonymous 
        (i.e., we do not tell advertisers which particular Ridester.com users 
        are members of which demographic groups), subject to the rest of this 
        privacy policy. When you respond to an advertisement, however, we ask 
        you to remember that if that ad that is targeted to a demographic group 
        and you decide to give the advertiser your personal information, then 
        the advertiser may be able to identify you as being a member of that demographic
