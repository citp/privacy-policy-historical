Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites

River Past allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the River Past Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the River Past Sites. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content.

River Past does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks River Past to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.

You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks. River Past's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.  


Our Commitment To Data Security

River Past uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to River Past and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, River Past makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

If River Past learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. River Past may post a notice on the River Past Sites if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us using this [contact form](http://www.riverpast.com/en/about/contact/email/index.aspx).

Our Commitment To Childrens' Privacy

For that reason, River Past does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information or non-personally-identifiable information on the River Past Sites from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of our website is directed to persons under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access the River Past Sites at any time or in any manner. If River Past learns that personally identifiable information of persons under 13 years of age has been collected on the River Past Sites without verified parental consent, then River Past will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.
