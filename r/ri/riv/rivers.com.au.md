# Rivers Privacy Policy

Specialty Fashion Group Ltd (SFG, us or we) is one of the largest retailers of women's fashion in Australia, making women everywhere look good and feel great through six diverse brands that offer style and value. The company's brands include Autograph, City Chic, Crossroads, Katies, Millers and Rivers. 

Some of the information you provide us as part of your dealings with us is 'personal information' under the Privacy Act 1998 (Cth) (the Act). This Privacy Policy sets out how we collect, handle, use, transmit and disclose your personal information and applies to you unless you give us explicit consent to act otherwise. If you would like to know more about data protection generally, there is information available from the Australian Information Commissioner at the following website - [www.oaic.gov.au.](http://www.oaic.gov.au/)

We generally collect personal information at our stores, coporate permises and online, both electronically and in hard copy.

At SFG we use your personal information primarily for the purposes of: marketing and promotion (by email, text messaging, social networking, conventional post and other means), internal accounting and auditing, recording proof of purchase, validating cheque transactions, receiving, processing and delivering product orders, processing payment, managing our websites (which may include registering you to use our websites), regulatory reporting and compliance, recruitment, servicing our relationship with you and to provide you with information, products and services you may request from time to time. We may communicate additional purposes for use and disclosure of personal information at the point of collection.

SFG may engage or deal with other persons or organisations (for example, loyalty program administrators and partners, data analysis specialists, statement producers, data mail houses, data processing organisations, marketing researchers, specialist call centres and service providers, promotional services providers, data hosting service providers, SFG agents, SFG contractors, SFG suppliers, SFG joint venture partners) (all **Third Party Providers** ) to assist SFG in carrying out the above purposes. Your personal information may be disclosed to such persons or organisations for these purposes and, in providing a service, they may contact you directly. In some circumstances, they may disclose personal information they collected from you to SFG for one or more of the purposes already mentioned.

The nature of the information collected will vary depending on the purpose for which the information was collected. However, the information we usually collect includes name, address, credit and debit card details, phone number, email address, work history, SFG website passwords and usernames, clothing size information etc. This information allows us to provide products and services to you or otherwise interact with you. If you do not provide us with the personal information requested, we may not be able to provide the services or interact with you.

If you provide your email address or mobile telephone number to SFG, you consent to us using your email address to email you and/or your mobile telephone number to SMS you for any of the purposes listed above.

If you believe any of your personal information held by us is incomplete or inaccurate, please notify us in writing so that we may update that information. Every reasonable effort will be made to provide or update personal information on request, unless an exemption under the Act applies.

### Data security

SFG will endeavour to take reasonable steps to protect the personal information we hold from misuse, loss and unauthorised access, modification, destruction or disclosure. We adopt practices to prevent unauthorised access to our premises, systems or physical storage locations. Personal information that is no longer required will be destroyed or de-identified, as appropriate.

SFG takes online transaction security seriously. We process online transactions using at least a 128 bit SSL encryption to a secure eWay credit card payment gateway system.

SFG collects but does not store your credit card details on its databases or servers. You will need to enter those details each time you make a purchase on our websites. However, we do maintain records of your transaction history. As mentioned above, SFG adopts practices which seek to prevent unauthorised access to such records.

The Internet is not a secure method of transmitting information. Accordingly, we cannot accept responsibility for the security of information you send to or receive from us over the Internet or for any unauthorised access, use or modification of that information. 

Our websites may provide links or references to other 3rd party websites and resources. These websites and resources are not subject to this Privacy Policy.

You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for any personal information you choose to disclose to a 3rd party through a 3rd party website referred to by or linked to any of our websites and that such 3rd parties may store your personal information in any location in accordance with their own security standards.

### Where information is stored

**

Subject to the below, personal information we collect from you is stored securely at our offices and on servers in Australia. SFG may also store your personal information at our offices and on servers located in New Zealand, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the USA. We may also engage or deal with Third Party Providers to assist with carrying out the purposes discussed in this Privacy Policy above, which may include the provision of data storage and hosting services in relation to your information. We will disclose your personal information to our Third Party Providers to the extent necessary for them to provide such assistance (including storage and data hosting services) and as otherwise required for you to use our websites and to obtain products or services we offer from time to time. In addition to Australia, our Third Party Providers may also store your personal information in New Zealand, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the USA. If our Third Party Providers store your personal information outside Australia, the Act requires us to ensure that they comply with applicable Australian privacy laws unless you agree otherwise. By providing us with information (including personal information), using our websites or obtaining any products or services provided by us from time to time, you: (i) consent to us disclosing and transferring your information (including personal information) to our Third Party Providers located outside of Australia, particularly in New Zealand, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the USA; (ii) consent to us and our Third Party Providers storing your information (including personal information) in locations and on servers located outside of Australia, particularly in New Zealand, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the USA; and (iii) agree that the requirement under the Act for us to ensure that our Third Party Providers comply with applicable Australian privacy laws in respect of your information (including personal information) does not apply if our Third Party Providers store personal information outside of Australia, including in New Zealand, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the USA (as applicable). We may in the future store your personal information in other locations outside of Australia or engage other providers that may store your personal information in or outside of Australia and will update this Privacy Policy if either is the case. We suggest that you visit our websites regularly to keep up to date with any changes.

### Sensitive information

Where SFG collects personal information that is also sensitive information, such as health details, we will only do so if the individual has consented or the collection is required or permitted by law, including where necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of a legal or equitable claim.
