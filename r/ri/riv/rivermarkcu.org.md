 FACTS                         PERSONAL INFORMATION?
 Why?                          Financial companies choose how they share your personal information. Federal law
                               gives consumers the right to limit some but not all sharing. Federal law also requires us
                               to tell you how we collect, share, and protect your personal information. Please read this
                               notice carefully to understand Rivermark Community Credit Union’s Privacy Policy.
 What?                         The types of personal information we collect and share depend on the accounts or
                               services you have with us. This information can include:
                                     Name, address, Social Security number, and income
                                     Account balances and transaction history
                                     Credit history and credit scores
 How?                          All financial companies need to share members’ personal information to run their
                               everyday business. In the section below, we list the reasons financial companies can
                               share their members’ personal information; the reasons Rivermark Community Credit
                               Union chooses to share; and whether you can limit this sharing.
                                                                          Does Rivermark
