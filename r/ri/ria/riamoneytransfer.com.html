	<h2>
		Personal Information
	</h2>
	In order to provide services, Ria collects and may disclose certain personal and nonpersonal information we receive from you on registration or transaction forms about you and the beneficiary of the fund transfer, such as name, address, and phone number, and financial account information. We also receive information about your transactions with us or others. In addition, depending on the services requested and/or the amount of your money transfer, Ria may also collect and may disclose personal and nonpersonal information, such as date of birth, Social Security number or other identifying number (including type, issuer, and expiration date), credit card information (including type, number and expiration date), and any other information necessary to verify and process the request.
	<p>
		&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p>
		 We (or our service providers acting on our behalf) may collect Personal Information about your use of our Services. This information may include information that may identify you as well as statistical information that does not identify you. In addition, web log information is automatically gathered every time you visit the website. It gathers nonpersonal identifying information such as Internet browser type, IP address, date and time stamps associated with transactions, and the pages you visited (see the use of "cookies" below).

		Cookies
	</h2>
	A cookie is a piece of text information that a web server may transfer to your web browser when you visit this website. Cookies are commonly used by websites to improve your experience and to enable systems to recognize your browsers. Only the information that you provide, or the choices you make while visiting a website, can be stored in a cookie. For example, the site cannot determine your email name unless you choose to type it. Allowing a website to create a cookie does not give that or any other site access to the rest of your computer and only the site that created the cookie can interpret it.
	<p>
		&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p>
		We may use cookies for a variety of purposes: to assist us in providing our services to you, to allow you to change pages during your visit to our website without reentering your password, to track activity on our website, or to determine whether you came to our site from an affiliate website.  We may use temporary, session cookies that expire and are automatically erased when you close your browser window to enable you to perform actions when you are logged into your account.  We may use long term, persistent cookies that expire in the distant future to better understand usage patterns so that we can improve our Service or to remember your choices for our Services.  We may permit third parties to place cookies through our website to provide us with better insights into the use of our Services and user demographics or to provide relevant advertising to you.  These third parties may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you use our Services.
	</p>
<p>
By accessing or using our Services, you consent to the placement of cookies on your computer or other device as described in this Privacy Policy.  You may adjust your browser settings to refuse or limit cookies, but if you do, certain features of our site may be limited or not work at all.  To learn more about cookies visit www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies.</p>

<p>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is an optional browser setting that allows you to express your preferences regarding tracking by advertisers and other third parties. We do not use technology that recognizes DNT signals from your web browser. </p>

	<p>
		&nbsp;
	</p>
<h3>Google Analytics</h3>
<p>
We use a tool called “Google Analytics” to collect information about use of this site. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this site. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve this site. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit this site, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html">Google Analytics Terms of Use</a> and the <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">Google Privacy Policy.</a> You may opt out of Google Analytics by visiting the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">Google Analytics opt-out page.</a></p>
