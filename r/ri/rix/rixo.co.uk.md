We are aware that your information may be confidential and we will protect the confidentiality of your information in accordance with our normal procedures and legal requirements.

**How will we use your information?**

We use your information in the following ways:

  * To ensure that the Site’s content is presented as effectively as possible for you;
  * For our internal purposes, such as quality control, site performance, system administration and to evaluate use of the Site, so that we can provide you with enhanced services;

  * To enable you to participate in the features of the Site, when you choose to do so.



We may monitor your use of the Site and record your email address and/or IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers.  This is statistical information about our users’ browsing actions and patterns and does not identify any individual.

We collect non-personal aggregated statistics data about Visitors to the Site and sales and traffic patterns.  Just to be clear, this information does not identify users in any personal capacity and we do not use this information to build profiles on individual users: it just contains generalised information about the users of the Site.

We only keep your information for as long as is necessary.

If you are an existing customer, we may contact you by email / SMS / telephone / post with information about our Products, events, launches and services which are similar to those we previously provided to you, unless you have indicated that you do not want to hear from us.
