Riley Guide has established the following privacy policy: 

**Personal Information** � Riley Guide does not store or retain any personally identifiable information about its users except when users subscribe to Riley Guide's email list or apply for special programs that may be offered from time to time, such as for a scholarship. Email subscribers are asked for an email address so that they can receive periodic newsletters and other updates about Riley Guide.
