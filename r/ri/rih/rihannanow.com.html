    <p><strong>ARTIST ARENA PRIVACY AND SECURITY AGREEMENT</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br>
<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br>

As used throughout this privacy policy, "you" will refer to the user of this website and "we" or "our" shall refer to Artist Arena. Protecting your privacy and keeping your information secure is a top priority for Artist Arena. We want you to understand what we do, so we ask that you read this Privacy and Security Statement carefully.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<strong>1. Collec<a name="_GoBack"></a>tion and Use of Personal Data </strong><br>
Artist Arena collects names, e-mail addresses, mailing addresses, telephone numbers, credit card information and event preferences when you purchase fan club memberships our website, <a href="http://www.artistarena.com" title="www.artistarena.com">www.artistarena.com</a> . Your e-mail address is stored so that we can send you special announcements and notifications of events that we believe may be of interest to you. Credit card information (including card type and issuer, credit card number, and expiration date) is not stored on-line. We do not now, and will not ever, provide this credit card information to others, except as required by law or in connection with criminal investigations.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Your mailing address is required so that we can mail your welcome kit to you and communicate with you about your order. Your mailing address is also needed to verify and authorize your credit card during your purchase. Additionally, your personal information may be added to our general Artist Arena customer list, which also includes information about individuals who purchase via phone or in person. From time to time in connection with certain events, we may use this customer list to send you special announcements and notifications of events.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Artist Arena provides you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us and our partners each time we request specific information about you.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Additionally, Artist Arena may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our website. Artist Arena may use cookies to keep track of your shopping cart, and to save your password and other personal information so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. We do not use cookies for any other purposes. Your use of this site is your consent to this process.<br>
