The information we collect is used to improve the content of our Web services and help us understand how people are using our services. We analyze our web site logs to continually improve the value of the materials available on our site. The information in our web site logs is not personally identifiable, and we make no attempt to link it with the individuals that browse our web site.

The Instant Answers service is RI.gov's live customer service application that allows visitors to "chat" in real-time with the Providence Public Library Reference Department in its role as the Statewide Reference Resource Center, which is funded through the Rhode Island Office of Library and Information Services. The Instant Answers service requires that certain information be collected and maintained. In addition to IP address, browser type, date and time of the visit, and the referring webpage, transcripts of the chats are saved for statistical, demographic, and/or customer service purposes. Some information is also collected through chat surveys on a volunteer basis.
