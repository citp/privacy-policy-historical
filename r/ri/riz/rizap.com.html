  <br>
  This Statement of Rights and Responsibilities ("Statement") derives  from the piZap  Principles,  and governs our relationship with users and others who interact with piZap.com.  By using or accessing piZap, you agree to this Statement.</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Privacy</strong><br>
    <br>
    Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our Privacy Policy to make important  disclosures about how you can use piZap to share piZap images with others and  how we collect and can use your content and information.&nbsp; We encourage you  to read the Privacy Policy, and to use it to help make informed decisions.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Sharing Your Content and Information</strong><br>
    <br>
    You own all of the content and information you post on PiZap, and you can  choose whether or not to make any piZap picture public by submitting it to the public  piZap gallery when you save your image. </li>
  <ol>
    <li>For content that is covered by intellectual property  rights, like photos and videos ("IP content"), you specifically give  us the following permission: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable,  sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you  post on or in connection with PiZap ("IP License"). This IP License  ends when you delete your IP content or your account.</li>
    <li>When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner  similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that  removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time  (but will not be available to others).</li>
    <li>When you publish a piZap image and make it “public”, it  means that you are allowing everyone, including people off of PiZap.com, to view  that image, and to associate it with your piZap username and/or your linked  Facebook profile. </li>
  </ol>
  <li><strong>Safety</strong><br>
    <br>
    We do our best to keep PiZap safe, but we cannot guarantee it. We need your  help to do that, which includes the following commitments: </li>
  <ol>
    <li>You will not send or otherwise post unauthorized  commercial communications (such as spam) on PiZap.</li>
    <li>You will not collect users' content or information, or  otherwise access PiZap, using automated means (such as harvesting bots, robots,  spiders, or scrapers) without our permission.</li>
    <li>You will not solicit login information or access an  account belonging to someone else.</li>
    <li>You will not bully, intimidate, or harass any user.</li>
    <li>You will not post content that: is hateful, threatening, or  pornographic; incites violence; or contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous  violence.</li>
    <li>You will not use PiZap to do anything unlawful,  misleading, malicious, or discriminatory.</li>
    <li>You will not do anything that could disable, overburden,  or impair the proper working of PiZap, such as a denial of service attack.</li>
    <li>You will not facilitate or encourage any violations of  this Statement.<br>
      &nbsp;</li>
  </ol>
  <li><strong>Registration and Account Security</strong><br>
    <br>
    PiZap users are NOT required to provide their real names or any other  information that may be used to identify them except a valid e-mail address or a  “connection” to a valid Facebook profile. In order to help maintain the  security of piZap: </li>
  <ol>
    <li>You will not create more than one personal profile.</li>
    <li>If we disable your account, you will not create another  one without our permission.</li>
    <li>You will not use PiZap if you are under 13 without the supervision of a parent or legal guardian.</li>
    <li>You will not use PiZap if you are a convicted sex offender.</li>
    <li>If you select a username for your account we reserve the  right to remove or reclaim it if we believe appropriate (such as when a  trademark owner complains about a username that does not closely relate to a  user's actual name).<br>
      &nbsp;</li>
  </ol>
  <li><strong>Protecting Other People's Rights</strong><br>
    <br>
    We respect other people's rights, and expect you to do the same. </li>
  <ol>
    <li>You will not post content or take any action on PiZap  that infringes or violates someone else's rights or otherwise violates the law.</li>
    <li>We can remove any content or information you post on PiZap  if we believe that it violates this Statement.</li>
    <li>If you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual  property rights, we will disable your account when appropriate.</li>
    <li>You will not use our copyrights or trademarks (including pZap,  the piZap Logos), or any confusingly similar marks, without our written  permission.</li>
    <li>You will not post anyone's  identification documents or sensitive financial information on piZap.<br>
