</p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Riskified also uses web beacons, in combination with cookies, to analyze usage patterns. The use of a web beacon allows us to record that someone has visited a particular web page, along with additional Non-PII that the website may choose to include with the beacon. Therefore, even if a user disables the browser from accepting cookies we may be able to collect information on such user.</span>
</p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0 c4">HOW DO WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT? </span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The information that we collect is used in order to analyze and provide our customers with an evaluation of whether a user may be engaging in fraudulent behavior or whether there is a risk that a transaction is fraudulent or unauthorized.

<p class="c9 c17"><span class="c0"></span></p>

</p>

<p class="c21 c13"><span class="c0 c4">POLICY TOWARDS CHILDREN</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.
