# RisingSunofNihon: Privacy Policy

### Privacy Policy of KnowMoreMedia

This policy covers user privacy, system security, and KnowMoreMedia information collection practices. This Privacy Policy Statement applies only to KnowMoreMedia web sites. You are encouraged to check Privacy Policies when going to another web site. 

These World Wide Web pages are provided as a service by KnowMoreMedia

Information presented on these pages is considered copywrited information and may not be distributed or copied without express written consent. 

Site Management Data:

KnowMoreMedia Web servers automatically collect information for site management and for statistical purposes. This computer system uses software programs to create summary statistics, which are used for such purposes as assessing what information is of most and least interest, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas. 

The use of "cookies":

KnowMoreMedia may assign cookies to our readers in order to save their preferences. This data is not shared with any third party. Accessing our websites is not dependent on accepting cookies and all major browsers allow you to disable cookies if you wish.

Third Party Cookies  
Many of our advertisers use cookies in order to determine the number of times you have seen an advertisement. This may be done to limit the number times you are shown the same advertisement. KnowMoreMedia does not have access to this data.

Consent to Voluntary Information Collection and Sharing:

All the information users submit to KnowMoreMedia is done on a voluntary basis. When a user clicks the "Submit" button on any of the Web forms found on KnowMoreMedia's sites they are indicating voluntarily consent to the conditions outlined in this policy. We do not collect personally identifiable information (e.g., name, address, phone number, e-mail address) unless you provide it. In all cases, the information collected is used to respond to user inquiries or to provide services requested by our users.

How e-mail is handled:

We use information you send us by e-mail only for the purpose for which it is submitted (e.g., to answer a question, to send information). In addition, if you do choose to provide information, it is only used to respond to your request (e.g., addressing a package to send you pamphlets or booklets) or to provide a service you are requesting (e.g., email notifications). 

You may choose to add your email address to our contact list via the forms on our websites. We agree that we will never share you email with any third party and that we will remove your email at your request. We don't currently send advertising via email, but in the future that may change and our email may contain advertisements and we may send dedicated email messages from our advertisers without revealing your email addresses to them. If you want to remove your email address please contact us via our contact form.

Comments/Message Boards

The majority of KnowMoreMedia websites contain comment sections (a.k.a. message boards). We do not actively monitor these comments and the information on them is for entertainment purposes only. If we are alerted to something we deem inappropriate in any way, we may delete it at our discretion. We use email validation on most of our message boards in order to reduce "comment spam." These email addresses will not be shared with any third party. While your email address will not be shared with any third party, the actual body and content of the comments and messages you submit are considered public property, and are published on the blog. So please don't offer any personal information in the body or content of your comments, unless you want that information displayed to the online world. We will actively remove "comment spam" from our comment sections.

How information is used:

The information KnowMoreMedia collects is used for a variety of purposes. We make every effort to clearly disclose at the point of collection how information is used and allow our Web site visitor to determine whether they wish to provide the information.

How long information is retained:

We periodical destroy the information we collect when the purpose for which it was provided has been fulfilled.

Ownership of Information
