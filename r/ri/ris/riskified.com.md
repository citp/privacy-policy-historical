The Platform is designed to enable these customers through the use of information which we collect and analyze to help prevent fraudulent transactions. 

We respect the privacy of Internet users in general and wish to set forth in this Privacy Policy ("Policy") Riskified's practices in connection with the collection and use of information. Please note that this Policy applies only to Riskified and does not state the use practices or policies of our customers, of the websites on which are Platform is used, or of other third parties. 

This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Riskified does not own or control or to people it does not employ or manage. 

## What types of information do we collect?

We collect information from our customers which may include personal information related to the users of our customer's services. Such information may include a user's IP address, username, user ID, pages viewed, items viewed, items purchased, transaction information (such as price, billing method, address). Our customers integrate our Platform on their websites which enables us to facilitate the collection of the information necessary to provide our fraud detection Services to our customers. 

Riskified uses cookies and web beacons and other similar technologies in connection with our Platform and Service. Cookies are tiny text files stored on your computer when users visit certain web pages. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. A user can instruct his or her browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or prompt the user before accepting a cookie from the websites the user visits. If the user does not accept cookies, however, he may not be able to enjoy the full functionality of many of the websites he visits. 

Riskified also uses web beacons, in combination with cookies, to analyze usage patterns. The use of a web beacon allows us to record that someone has visited a particular web page, along with additional Non-PII that the website may choose to include with the beacon. Therefore, even if a user disables the browser from accepting cookies we may be able to collect information on such user. 

## How do we use the information we collect?

The information that we collect is used in order to analyze and provide our customers with an evaluation of whether a user may be engaging in fraudulent behavior or whether there is a risk that a transaction is fraudulent or unauthorized. Except for the information collected from our customer we may use information from different sources, including other customers or third party providers. 

## What information do we share with third parties?

Riskified may use information for the use and development of its Platform and Services and for providing the Services to customers, including by third parties that provide services to Riskified for these purposes. Riskified does not sell, distribute or disclose personally identifiable information or information on individual users or customers. 

Riskified may disclose information if it reasonably believe that it is legally required to do so or in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including but not limited to, fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person. Riskified may share aggregated data derived from the Platform, including, for example, statistics about Platform activity. Finally, Riskified may transfer information to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets, reorganization, or other corporate change. 

## Data storage and security

All of the user data collected by Riskified is stored in such a manner that cannot be tracked back to specific individuals and information about a specific user cannot be retrieved; we maintain reasonable physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to protect all our data from accidental, unauthorized or unlawful access, use, modification, disclosure, loss, or destruction. However, no security measures, as thorough as may be, are 100% perfect and there can be no absolute assurance of security and therefore, we cannot and do not offer an absolute guarantee or warrant the security of the information we possess. 

## Policy towards children

We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at support@riskified.com.
