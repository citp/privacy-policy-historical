# Privacy – Riskified

Riskified provides online merchants (“Merchant”) a service that helps prevent fraudulent online transactions (“Fraud Prevention”).  Merchants integrate our Fraud Prevention on their eCommerce websites and mobile apps where consumers like you place orders (“eCommerce Platform”).

It describes how we collect, use and share personal information, and the rights and options available to you with respect to your information.

You are not obligated by law to provide us with your personal data, but the eCommerce Platform may require that you provide us with your personal data to enable the  processing of orders you place. Please note that this Policy does not cover the practices or policies of Merchants, the eCommerce Platform, or other parties.

## In short…

This is a quick summary of the policies, listed  for your convenience. The summary does not substitute the full Policy.

  * We use the information first and foremost to analyze whether the transaction is fraudulent.
  * In some circumstances, we share your information mainly in order to operate the Fraud Prevention service. For that purpose, we may combine it with information acquired from publicly available data sources or contract with third parties for cross-referencing.
  * The Merchant may use Riskified’s fraud assessment to decide whether to accept or decline your order, based solely on automated processing.
  * You may request access to your personal information and/or seek to have such information updated, corrected, or deleted, if the law provides you those rights.
  * We may store and process information outside the country where you are located.
