# Privacy Policy - Right Mobile Phone

## Privacy policy - Commitment to your privacy

This site is owned and operated by Right Mobile Phone. Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. At Right Mobile Phone, we want to make your online visit a satisfying and safe experience.

Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should fully understand our policy and the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it.Please take a moment to read our Privacy Policy so you know what choices you have about the information we may ask you for. This policy may change from time to time so it's a good idea to come back and read through it again, from time to time.

## Information Right Mobile Phone gathers and tracks

Right Mobile Phone gathers two types of information about users:

  * Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions to receive our electronic newsletters, to participate in our message boards or forums, to email a friend, and from participation in polls and surveys: 
  * Information Right Mobile Phone gathers through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views and cookies used throughout our sites. This information allows us to better tailor our content to readers' needs and to help our advertisers and sponsors better understand the demographics of our audience. Because Right Mobile Phone derives its revenue mainly from sponsorships and advertising, providing such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping our service free to users. Under no circumstances does Right Mobile Phone divulge any information about an individual user to a third party in order to protect your privacy. 



Right Mobile Phone Gathers User Information In The Following Processes:

  * Optional Voluntary Information



We offer the following free services, which require some type of voluntary submission of personal information by users:

### 1\. Electronic newsletters policy (Dispatches)

We will offer a free electronic newsletter to users. Right Mobile Phone gathers the email addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe from various pages on the website. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by following the link provided in every newsletter that points users to the subscription management page.

### 2\. Message boards/forums policy

Users of the site's Message Boards and Forums must register separately for these services (both are free of charge) in order to post messages, although they needn't register to visit the site. During registration the user is required to supply a username, password, and email address. Please be aware that information posted on the website is the views of individual members and not necessarily that of Right Mobile Phone.

### 3\. "E-mail this to a friend" policy

Our site users can choose to electronically forward a link, page, or documents to someone else by clicking "e-mail this to a friend". The user must provide their email address, as well as that of the recipient. This information is used only in the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient know who sent the email. The information is not used for any other purpose. We may offer you the option to subscribe to our free electronic newsletter.

### 4\. Polling

We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions with other users and see what our audience thinks about important issues. Opinions or other responses to polls are aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user. Right Mobile Phone may use a system to "tag" users after they have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question. We may use this information to improve your own particular website experience.

### 5\. Surveys

Right Mobile Phone may occasionally conduct user surveys to better target our content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys with our sponsors, advertisers and partners. We never share any of this information about specific individuals with any third party. We may release public articles and press releases referring to aggregated information we have gathered with a survey.

### Children

Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting parental consent.

### Usage tracking

Right Mobile Phone tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. Right Mobile Phone does break down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser). The information collected is common with regular websites.

Right Mobile Phone sometimes tracks and files the search terms that users enter in our Search function. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. As the internet evolves websites are becoming tailored increasingly to individuals (please see below: USE OF INFORMATION).

### Cookies

We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Right Mobile Phone uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above). Our advertising system delivers a one-time cookie to better track ad impressions and click rates.

You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use this site. However, you do need cookies to participate actively in message boards, forums, polling and surveys.

## Use of information

Right Mobile Phone uses any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their experience in our network of sites, whether to provide interactive or person ali zed elements on the sites or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users.

As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily provide in order to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to participate in polls, surveys, message boards, and forums. We send out newsletters to subscribers on a regular schedule (depending on the newsletter), and occasionally send out special editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested in something we are doing. Right Mobile Phone never shares newsletter mailing lists with any third parties, including advertisers, sponsors or partners.

When we use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. We track search terms entered in Search function as one of many measures of what interests our users. These searches may be ‘tagged’ in order to improve your website experience on the resultant website pages.

Right Mobile Phone creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs. Because we don't track the usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser or sponsor will never know that a specific user clicked their ad. We will not disclose any information about any individual user except to comply with applicable law or v ali d legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.

## Sharing of the information

Right Mobile Phone uses the above-described information to tailor our content to suit your needs and help our advertisers better understand our audience's demographics. This is essential to keeping our service free. We will not share information about individual users with any third party, except to comply with applicable law or v ali d legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.

## Security

Right Mobile Phone operates secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our cus tom ers. Access to information databases is secure and in a supervised environment.

## Opt-out policy

We give users options wherever necessary and practical. Such choices include:

  * **Opting not to register to receive our electronic newsletters.**
  * **Opting not to participate in certain interactive areas, which completely alleviates the need to gather any personally identifiable information from our users**
