This Privacy Policy governs your interaction with the Sites and your registration for and use of our online services (collectively, the “Services”).

### A. The information we gather.

When visitors use the Services, we passively collect and aggregate information indicating, among other things, which pages were visited, the order in which they were visited, and which links were “clicked.” Collecting such information involves the collection and logging of IP addresses, operating system, Internet Service Provider (ISP), and browser software used by each user of the Services. The information we collect helps us identify the most popular areas of the Sites and determine the effectiveness of our promotional activities. In addition, we may disclose some of this information to advertisers to inform them of the number of people who have viewed and/or clicked their advertisements or content. On mobile applications, we use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Services on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregate usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from, type of device, and geolocation. On mobile applications, we may send push notifications to your device. You may opt-out of these at the device level. 

The use of cookies by our partners is covered by our privacy policy. We do have access or control over these cookies. Our partners use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. 

In certain areas of the Sites, such as those in which you complete a profile, submit your CV/resume, create a new account, subscribe to notifications, comment on an article or within our forum(s) or enter Rigzone-sponsored contests or promotions, we may request that you provide us with certain personal information, such as your e-mail address, first and last name, postal zip code, phone number, profession, or work experience, current employer/job title. We will, in such situations, seek to identify which informational items are required and which are optional. In some instances, we may collect geolocation based information for the purpose of helping identify jobs in your area and to provide other services specific to your geolocation. We may share this information for the sole purpose of providing you this feature. You may opt-out of location based services by editing the setting at the mobile device level. 

Job seekers should post profiles and CV/resumes on our Sites only if they wish such information to be viewed by our customers. At any time, job seekers may elect that their profile and/or CV/resume not be searchable by our customers by logging into their account and changing the status of their profile or, if that is not possible, they may contact us at [support@rigzone.com](mailto:support@rigzone.com) and we will make the change for them. 

In addition, job seekers may elect to make their profile searchable by our customers on a confidential basis only. In this case, the user’s name and contact information will not be displayed to customers performing searches on our Sites. If the customer desires to contact the confidential job seeker regarding an employment opportunity, they will use our Sites to notify the job seeker. The Sites will generate a contact request from the customer to the job seeker without exposing the job seeker’s PPI to the customer. When posting a resume confidentially, it is the job seeker's responsibility to ensure that their contact information is not included within their resume attachment. 

Our Services are not available to children under 16 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16 years of age. 

Please note that we cannot control the acts of users of the Services. All members and visitors should be aware that, when they disclose personal information in a CV/resume or profile or other medium, the information may be collected and used by others to send that person unsolicited email from other parties outside DHI. In the event that you encounter any user who is improperly collecting or using information about you or other users, please contact [privacy@rigzone.com](mailto:privacy@rigzone.com). 

### B. How we use the information we gather

Please take some time to familiarize yourself with the different ways we use the information we gather. Rigzone encourages all third parties involved, including but not limited to advertisers, to adhere to our policies regarding the privacy of our visitors and users and to otherwise handle personal information in a responsible manner. Nevertheless, in the event you encounter any third party associated with, or who claims association with, DHI who you feel is improperly collecting or using information about you, please contact [ privacy@rigzone.com](mailto:privacy@rigzone.com).

**1\. How we use passively collected information:** We use information collected passively, as identified above, in aggregate form to build higher quality, more useful Services by performing statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our visitors and users, and by measuring demographics and interests regarding specific areas of the Services. We may provide statistical information based on this data to advertisers, users, and other current and potential business partners. We may also use the aggregate data to inform these third parties as to the number of people who have viewed and/or clicked through links to their sites. 

**2\. How we use personal information:** We may use the personal information a user submits for the following purposes: 

  1. To understand a user’s needs and create content that is relevant to the user;
  2. To generate statistical studies;
  3. To conduct market research and planning by sending user surveys;
  4. To notify user referrals of DHI services, information, or products when a user requests that DHI send such information;
  5. To improve services, information, and products;
  6. To help a user complete a transaction, or provide services or customer support to users and to recipients of our products;
  7. To communicate with the user and with recipients of our products and services;
  8. To email users about services, information, products and offers from our business partners (and as set forth in section C, How we share information we gather);
  9. To personalize the Site for the user;
  10. To notify the user of any changes with the Sites which may affect the user;
  11. To enforce terms of use on the Sites; 
  12. To allow the user to purchase products, access services, or otherwise engage in activities the user selects; and
  13. To allow us to contact you by phone and/or email or social media. In some cases, this includes SMS/ MMS messaging, and carrier charges may apply. 



User names, identifications (“IDs”), and email addresses (as well as any additional information that a user may choose to post) may be publicly available on the Sites when a user voluntarily and publicly discloses personal information, such as when a user uses features to send a message to another user, or as part of a message posted to a public forum or a publicly-released software application. Users may not be able to change or remove public postings once posted. Any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from these pages, contact us at [ privacy@rigzone.com](mailto:privacy@rigzone.com). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. 

With respect to surveys, in the event that responses are publicly disclosed, users will be notified at the time they take the survey. Circumstances under which we would publicly disclose information collected from surveys include, but are not limited to, sharing survey results with the Sites’ users, providing data to our advertisers on user preferences and/or demographics, and publicizing overall usage data in press communications. Where surveys allow users to submit written comments, and where we advise users of the possibility of such disclosure at the time they take the survey, we reserve the right to disclose any information provided by users, provided that no personal information identifying a specific user is disclosed. Participation in surveys is at a user’s option; we do not conduct mandatory surveys. 

### C. How we share information we gather

**Service Providers**

Subject to the foregoing, we use your personal information in several ways. We may share your personal information with service providers to help us with our business activities such as processing credit cards, email and social network marketing, offering customer service, or operating a community forum. These service providers are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us. With respect to job applications, we will not disclose your profile or resume on our Sites to prospective employers without your consent or to carry out your instructions. 

**Third Parties**

We may share your information with third-party business partners, for instance, for the purpose of enhancing our products and services or so that they can market their products or services to you. If you do not want us to share your personal information with these companies, contact us at [privacy@rigzone.com](mailto:privacy@rigzone.com). 

If you "opt in" to receive promotional materials from third parties, information you have made available to us may be made available to third parties who provide goods or services that we believe may be of interest to you. You may “opt out” of receiving such materials at any time in a variety of ways: by using the “opt-out/unsubscribe” link included in each email, by changing your subscriptions preferences on the “user settings” page in your account or by contacting us at [privacy@rigzone.com](mailto:privacy@rigzone.com) If you have provided more than one email address to our service, you may continue to be contacted, unless you request to unsubscribe each email address you have provided. If you opted- in to receive information directly from third parties, then you must contact those third parties directly to opt-out. 

In order to effectively tailor our services, these Sites may sell your personal information to third party consultants and business partners, including, but not limited to other lead generation companies (collectively “Third Party Contractors”) to collect, compile, organize, and market to you related services. 

When you submit any personal information on this Site, we will obtain your consent authorizing the Sites to sell to Third Party Contractors any and all personal information that is necessary to enable additional service offerings. 

**Other Purposes**

Please note that we reserve the right to disclose information submitted by or concerning any visitor or user as we reasonably feel is necessary to protect our systems or business. We may also disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. We cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who may be using our servers or Services for illegal activities. We also reserve the right to report any suspected illegal activity to law enforcement for investigation or prosecution, or to suspend or terminate your use of the Services in connection with any suspected illegal or infringing activity or if you are in violation of our Terms of Use Agreement or other published guidelines. 

If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on the Site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information. We reserve the right to assign, sell, license, or otherwise transfer to a third party your personal information in connection with an assignment, sale, joint venture, or other transfer or disposition of any portion or all of DHI’s or its affiliated entities’ assets or stock.

If a user does not want us or our partners to deploy browser cookies in the user’s browser when the user visits the Sites, the user may set the browser to reject cookies or to notify the user when a web site tries to place cookies in the browser program. Rejecting cookies may affect a user’s ability to use some of the products, features, functions, or services on our Sites. 

The ads appearing on the Sites may be delivered to visitors by third parties, such as Google. The third party advertising technology that we use on the Sites uses information derived from a user’s visits to the Sites to target advertising within the Sites. In addition, our advertisers may use other third party advertising technology to target advertising on the Sites. In the course of serving advertisements to the Sites, our partners may place or recognize a unique cookie on a user’s browser. Information about users’ visits to the Sites, such as the number of times users have viewed an ad (but not users’ names, addresses, or other personal information), are used to serve ads to visitors. The use of cookies enables our partners to serve ads to users based on such user’s visit to the Sites and other sites on the Internet. As with other cookies, and consistent with our policy on cookies stated above, the user may block or delete such cookies from the user’s drive or memory.

### F. Surveys and Sweepstakes

Occasionally, we may conduct surveys in order to better deliver advertisements and content and to better understand your needs relating to the Services. We will not share your survey information with any third party, except in aggregate form. 

From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personal information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). That information, to the extent it conflicts with this policy, will govern that particular promotion or sweepstakes - please remember to read it carefully. We may use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor the Sites use, to personalize the Sites, to send participants an email, and to measure participants’ demographics, interests and opinions. We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; that company will be prohibited from using our users’ personal information for any other purpose. We will not share the personal information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice. 

If you choose to use our referral service to tell another person about a job, we will ask you for that person’s email address. We will automatically send that person a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. We use this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email, and do not store these email addresses. 

### G. Social Media Features

The Sites include social media features, such as the Facebook like button and widgets that run on our Sites. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Sites, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
