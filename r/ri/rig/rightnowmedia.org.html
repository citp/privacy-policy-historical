    <p id="u11586-3">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u11586-5">Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it.</p>
    <p id="u11586-6">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u11586-8">Information RightNow Ministries International gathers and keeps track of:</p>
    <p id="u11586-9">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u11586-11">RightNow Ministries International gathers three types of information about users:</p>
    <p id="u11586-12">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u11586-14">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions to receive our electronic newsletters, to email a friend, from requests for support and/or service, and from participation in polls and surveys.</p>
    <p id="u11586-15">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u11586-17">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information RightNow Ministries International gathers through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This information allows us to better tailor our content to visitors' needs.</p>
    <p id="u11586-18">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u11586-20">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information RightNow Ministries International gathers through the sale of products. This information includes names, email addresses, phone numbers, addresses and payment details of the purchase.</p>
    <p id="u11586-21">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u11586-23">RightNow Ministries International Gathers User Information In The Following Processes:</p>
    <p id="u11586-24">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u11586-26">Optional Voluntary Information</p>
    <p id="u11586-27">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u11586-29">We may offer the following free services, which require some type of voluntary submission of personal information by users:</p>
    <p id="u11586-30">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u11586-32">1. Electronic newsletters (Dispatches)</p>
    <p id="u11586-33">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u11586-35">We may offer a free electronic newsletter to users. RightNow Ministries International gathers the email addresses of users and communicates with them periodically by email. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by following the link provided in every newsletter that points users to the subscription management page. Users can also un-subscribe to the newsletters at the time of registration.</p>
    <p id="u11586-36">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u11586-38">2. "E-mail this to a friend" Service</p>
    <p id="u11586-39">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u11586-41">Our site users can choose to electronically forward a link, page, or documents to someone else by clicking "e-mail this to a friend". The user must provide their email address, as well as that of the recipient. This information is used only in the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient know who sent the email. The information is not used for any other purpose.</p>
    <p id="u11586-42">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u11586-44">3. Polling</p>
    <p id="u11586-45">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u11586-47">We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions with other users and see what our audience thinks about important issues. Opinions or other responses to polls are aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user. RightNow Ministries International may use a system to "tag" users after they have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question. This tag is not correlated with information about individual users.</p>
    <p id="u11586-48">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u11586-50">4. Surveys</p>
    <p id="u11586-51">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u11586-53">RightNow Ministries International may occasionally conduct user surveys to better target our content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys with our sponsors, advertisers and partners. We never share any of this information about specific individuals with any third party.</p>
    <p id="u11586-54">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u11586-55">&nbsp;</p>

    <p id="u11586-65">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u11586-67">RightNow Ministries International tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. RightNow Ministries International does break down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser).</p>
    <p id="u11586-68">&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u11586-70">RightNow Ministries International sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that users enter in our Search function. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas.
