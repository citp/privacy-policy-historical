RightNow collects information from our users at several different points on our website to enable us to better inform you about our product.

RightNow is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.

**Registration**

In order to use some functions on this website, a user must first complete a registration form. During registration, the user is required to give their contact information (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. RightNow does not share any personally identifiable or private customer information submitted online with third parties. Demographic information may also be requested (such as zip code or type of business). This information may be stored, analyzed and used to assist us to improve our services. 

**Cookies**

A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification number that is transferred from a website to the hard drive of your computer allowing the website to identify you and track your activities on our site. Cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to simplify and enhance the experience on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie information is no longer available through our server. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site.

**Log Files**

We use IP addresses in log files to analyze trends, administer the site, track a user's movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Log files do not enable us to access personally identifying information, such as email addresses. 

**Links**

This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that RightNow is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected at this website. 

**RightNow Web Support Central**

Currently, RightNow Web support is available in its entirety to RightNow Web customers. If you are a current RightNow Web customer, you may receive web support by entering Support Central and logging in. This allows you to ask questions of our personnel. Your questions and our answers may be published on our website, and made available to other website visitors. However, those visitors will have no way of knowing that one or more of the questions on the website was asked by you. If you are not a RightNow Web customer, you may still experience the value of our product by entering Support Central without logging in, and viewing the "Questions & Answers" portion of RightNow Web. However, you may not then ask any of your own questions.

**Webcasts**

RightNow offers its users an opportunity to participate in live Webcasts which are hosted by PlaceWare, Inc. A participant must register through a link to take part in the Webcast. The information collected at the time of registration (such as name, address, e-mail address) enables us to contact the participant with password and log-in information for the Webcast. This information may be used to contact the participant about our services either by phone or via on-line surveys. A user may opt-out of being contacted in the future by emailing [info@rightnow.com](mailto:info@rightnow.com) with their request to delete them from the "Webcast email list." Please refer to placeware.com for more information regarding their privacy statement.

If a user wishes to subscribe to our e-Service OnTarget newsletter, they must opt in. At that point we ask for contact information such as name and email address. A subscriber is given an opportunity to opt out of receiving the newsletter when they receive a follow-up email to their subscription request.   
Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter can be removed from distribution by sending a blank message to the personal unsubscribe address found at the end of the e-Service OnTarget newsletter they receive.

**Public Forums**

This site makes chat rooms forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.

**Surveys**

From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.

Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.

If a customer joins our Inner Circle Program and decides to refer a prospect as a part of that program, we ask them to provide the prospect's name, company, title, phone, address (if available), as well as information about their relationship with the prospect. The Inner Circle member can request a call from the sales representative prior to the prospect being contacted. The referral prospect may contact RightNow at info@rightnow.com to request the removal of this information from the RightNow database.

RightNow takes precautions to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. Our site is firewall protected. Full backups are performed every weekend on the entire file system and incremental backups are done daily.   
Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.

We currently contract with Frontline Processing to provide credit card processing services. This facility enables you to purchase some of our products on-line via a credit card. Your credit card information is protected via the SSL encryption method. For your protection, you should never place your credit card details in unencrypted emails.

**Special Offers**

We send all new Inner Circle members a welcoming email to verify password and username. We send the e-Service OnTarget newsletter to those people who specifically request it. Visitors to our website will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals. Out of respect for the privacy of our users, we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see "Opting Out" below.
