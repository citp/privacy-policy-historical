**Personal Information Shared with Contractual Counterparties**

If you subscribe to use our Services, your Personally Identifiable Information will be shared with counterparties to the documents that you electronically sign using our Services. Upon execution of a document, all parties to a document (" _Signing Parties_ ") receive a copy of the signed document, an appended signature certificate (a " _Signature Certificate_ "), and certain metadata. The signed document, Signature Certificate, and related metadata may contain the following information about the Signing Parties: names; email addresses; IP addresses; drawn signatures; and checksums, which may represent, but not reveal, biometric signature data, system preferences, browser preferences, installed plug-ins, local storage preferences, screen resolutions, local time zones, font listings, and user agent information (such information, " _Checksum Metadata_ "), as well as any Personally Identifiable Information included in the document.

When a Signing Party has elected to integrate with a third-party service, such as ShareFile, Dropbox, or Salesforce, signed documents are disseminated to each such third-party service (each, an " _Integration Partner Service_ ") via an application programming interface. When documents are transmitted to an Integration Partner Service, the signed documents, Signature Certificates, and related metadata transmitted by or to the Integration Partner Service or stored by such Integration Partner Service may contain Checksum Metadata of the Signing Parties as well as any Personally Identifiable Information included in the document. In the event that signed documents are disseminated to an Integration Partner Service, the data, including the documents, Signature Certificates and Checksum Metadata, are subject to the security protocols and privacy policies of such Integration Partner Service.

**Resale or Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information to Third Parties**

We do not sell, rent, loan, trade or lease any Personally Identifiable Information collected on the Site, unless you request us to contact you. On occasion, we sell, rent, loan, trade or lease Non-Personally Identifiable Information collected on the Site. We also periodically mine anonymous statistical information (i.e. Non-Personally Identifiable Information) and make it available to third parties and our business partners.

As previously disclosed, your Personally Identifiable Information, including such information in the documents, Signature Certificates, and Checksum Metadata, will be shared with Signing Parties, and documents, Signature Certificates, and Checksum Metadata will be transmitted to and stored by other Signing Parties who are counterparties to your documents and may be stored by third-party Integration Partner Services to which you or other Signing Parties who are counterparties to your documents have elected to transmit Personally Identifiable Information. We may share certain Personally Identifiable Information we collect about you with our service providers who perform functions on our behalf. Examples include processing credit card payments, sending postal mail and email, analyzing data, and providing marketing assistance and customer service. These service providers are not authorized by us to use or disclose Personally Identifiable Information except as needed to perform their functions or comply with legal requirements, and they may not use it for any other purpose. Further, they must process the Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**Use of Personally Identifiable Information by Signing Parties**

If you use the Services, we have no control over the data collection, storage, or transmission practices of the other Signing Parties to your documents. If your documents, Signature Certificates, or Checksum Metadata contain Personally Identifiable Information or other information that you would not want disclosed, you should ensure that the other Signing Parties who are counterparties to your documents have adopted reasonable administrative, physical, technical, and organizational safeguards.

**Browser Information Collected on the Website**

We analyze our website logs to continually re-evaluate our Site's content to improve our Site and Services. These logs do not allow the identification of any Personally Identifiable Information. Our Site also records IP addresses of visitors. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. We use IP addresses to identify Signing Parties, analyze trends, track user movement, and gather broad statistics. The IP addresses of Signing Parties are disclosed on the signature certificates of documents.

**Use of Cookies**

A "cookie" is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on the Site to simplify user login and account management. Your web browser allows you to control and limit cookies on your computer. If you reject cookies, you may still use the Site, but your ability to use some areas or functions of the Site, including your ability to place orders for the Services, may be limited. Cookies will not be sold, rented, or loaned, but they may be used for analytics and advertising purposes in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**Information Sharing for Analytics and Advertising**

We use snippets of analytics code written in the Javascript language in our web pages, cookies, and web beacons to track visitors to the Site, provide us with analytics for improving our Site and the Services, and for buying, selling, and delivering online advertising about our Site, the Services, the RightSignature Applications, the Linked Sites, and the Widgets. We do not share Personally Identifiable Information with our third-party analytics and third-party advertising partners. Generally, when you visit the Site, or use the Services, the RightSignature Applications, the Linked Sites, and the Widgets, certain information, including the web address of the page that you visit and your IP address, may be transmitted to our analytics and online advertising partners.

**Do Not Track Information**

**Confidentiality and Security of Personally Identifiable Information**

Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we will keep your Personally Identifiable Information private and will not share it with third parties, unless such disclosure is necessary to: (a) comply with a court order or other legal process; (b) protect our rights or property; or (c) enforce our Terms of Use or any Ancillary Agreements to which you have consented and to which you are a party.

**Email**

We comply with the federal CAN-SPAM Act of 2003. We will not send you marketing messages if you have opted out. We will not share, sell, rent, swap or authorize any third party to use your email address for commercial purposes without your permission except to the extent that we determine, in our reasonable discretion, is necessary to provide any Services that you have ordered from us. If you feel you have received an email from us in error, please email us at [optout@rightsignature.com](mailto:optout@rightsignature.com) or let us know at the address provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.

We reserve the right to send you email relating to your account status. This includes order confirmations, renewal/expiration notices, notices of credit-card problems, other transactional emails and notifications about major changes to our Services, Ancillary Documents, or our Privacy Policy. If you have registered for certain online Services provided on the Site, you may receive emails specific to such Services.

We may periodically email you messages about products and Services that we think may be of interest to you. We use a third-party service provider to perform our marketing emails and provide them with your name and email address so that they can deliver emails to you. You can choose not to receive messages in the future by either (1) following the "unsubscribe" instructions located near the bottom of each email, or (2) you can email us at [optout@rightsignature.com](mailto:optout@rightsignature.com) or let us know at the address provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.

When you sign up to receive email from us, you can select either plain text or HTML (with images) format. If you select the HTML format, we may place embedded pixels or other technologies to determine whether or not readers viewed the email. This process does not leave any information on your computer, nor does it collect information from your computer.

We track, transmit, and retain information about when Signing Parties have created, viewed, and signed documents. Parties who use the Service will receive notifications when other parties have created, viewed, and signed documents. Your name and email address will be disclosed to Signing Parties who are counterparties to your documents.

If you send us emails, you should be aware that information disclosed in emails may not be secure or encrypted and may be available to others. We suggest that you exercise caution when deciding to disclose any Personally Identifiable Information or confidential information in emails. We will use your email address to respond directly to your questions or comments.

**Protection of your Personally Identifiable Information**

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of your Personally Identifiable Information, we have put in place commercially reasonable physical, technical and administrative controls to protect your Personally Identifiable Information. We use standard security protocols and mechanisms to exchange the transmission of sensitive data, such as credit card details. When you enter sensitive Personal Information such as your credit card number on our site, we encrypt it using secure socket layer technology. Credit card numbers are stored at and tokenized by our merchant processing provider and are not stored on the Site. Please note that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.

**Retention and Deletion**

We will retain your Personally Identifiable Information for as long as your account is active; as needed to provide you products or Services; as needed for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy or at the time of collection; as necessary to comply with our legal obligations (e.g., to honor opt-outs), resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements; or to the extent permitted by law. At the end of the retention period, we will delete your Personal Information in a manner designed to ensure that it cannot be reconstructed or read.
