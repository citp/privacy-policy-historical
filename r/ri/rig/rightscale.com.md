**1\. Information We Collect**

Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is information that can be directly associated with an individual (such as name, email address, or telephone number), or information about activities directly linked to an individual (such as products and services you have used or purchased).

We collect PII from you in the following ways:

**Information provided to us directly**

You, or someone acting on your behalf, may provide PII to us when you interact with us online and offline. For example:

  * We may gather such things as name, physical address, email address and phone number when you contact or communicate with us;
  * We may gather information such as the products and services you purchase, download or register to use, as well as financial information such as credit card numbers when you engage in transactions with us;
  * We may gather user preferences, product interests, industry focus, community choices and other customer profile information when you register for an online account, subscribe to a newsletter, participate in communities or an event, program, class or promotion, or click on a URL; or
  * We may accept your resume or CV when you apply for a job.



**Information we collect through technology: Products and Services**

Certain RightScale products and services that you purchase, download, or register to use may connect and transmit telemetry and system/product data to RightScale (or its authorized agents). This data may include, but is not limited to, system model, operating system, host ID and IP address.

We use this information to tell you when updates and new product versions are available, provide agreed upon diagnostic, monitoring and management services, as well as enhance our products and services, and better communicate with you.

Furthermore, in the course of using RightScale products and services, you or someone else in your organization may provide us with information about your systems infrastructure and access to your systems infrastructure. In addition, RightScale may ‘self-discover’ this information by analyzing additional parts your systems infrastructure that you did not explicitly input into the product. This information may include, but is not limited to:

  * Names and IP addresses of servers
  * Operating systems of servers
  * Applications installed on servers
  * Usernames and passwords of server and database administrators
  * Usernames and passwords of application users
  * Keys to systems infrastructure
  * Performance of elements within the systems infrastructure
  * Configuration information for elements within the systems infrastructure
  * Operational logs of elements within the systems infrastructure
  * Locations of files and databases within the infrastructure



**Information we collect through our Website:**

When you are on RightScale’s website, we collect information about the pages you visit. Some web pages use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to automatically collect information from you. When you visit a RightScale website, we may send one or more cookies (small text files containing a string of characters) to your computer to uniquely identify your browser. We may use "web beacons" (electronic images also known as pixel tags or clear gifs) to recognize a cookie on your computer when you view or act upon a web page, an advertisement that we've placed on a third-party web page or an email we've sent.

These cookies, web beacons and similar technologies enable us to collect certain types of information about your visit to RightScale's websites or online service such as:

  * Internet Protocol Address;
  * Browser type;
  * Browser language;
  * Operating system;
  * Referring site (site you visited before coming to our site);
  * Date and time of visit;
  * URL of pages visited; and
  * Other browsing behavior, such as products and white papers downloaded.



We may link this information to PII to provide better service to you and to improve RightScale's product and services offerings. If you do not wish to have navigational patterns analyzed, please disable cookies in your browser.

Most browsers allow you to remove and block cookies and web beacons. Please note that if you choose to erase or block cookies, you will need to re-enter your user ID and password to access certain parts of RightScale's website. You may also notice that you will be served only generic information not tailored to your specific interests.

In addition, if you block cookies, you may not be able to use certain RightScale website features or take full advantage of our RightScale service offerings.

**Information from other sources**

We sometimes obtain information from other sources, such as mergers and acquisitions, data brokers, or commercial lists, and merge this with information we have previously collected.

If you give us PII on behalf of someone else (or someone else gives us PII on your behalf), the person providing the PII must have consent to do so from the person whose information is being provided to RightScale. Some RightScale events, websites or services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company. For example, RightScale might co-sponsor a webinar in conjunction with one of its partners and allow you to register for such webinar through the RightScale website. If you provide PII in these cases, both RightScale and the other company(ies) may receive the information collected and use the information according to each company's privacy policy and agreement with you.
