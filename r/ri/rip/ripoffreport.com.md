# Ripoff Report | Privacy Policy

This privacy policy applies to the Ripoff Report web site. Our contact information is:

Xcentric Ventures, LLC  
Ripoff Report  
PO Box 310

## GENERAL INTRODUCTORY INFORMATION

We respect your privacy. This is why we have taken the time to disclose our information collection practices and our privacy policy. Please take the time to review this document. **It is important that you understand how we do things around here, and, if you don't agree with these practices, do not use the website, register for a user account, nor sign up for any related emails, etc. It's that simple.**

Protecting your private information is our priority. This Statement of Privacy applies to the website RipoffReport.com and RipoffReportLegalDirectory.com (collectively "Ripoff Report") and governs data collection and usage of such data. By using Ripoff Report you consent to the data practices described in this statement.

## PURPOSES FOR COLLECTING INFORMATION

Collecting information provides not only benefits to us as we figure out new services and develop best practices for the site but also specific benefits to our website visitors and by providing this information, our staff or authorized third-parties as outlined in our Terms of Service can contact you regarding your post or otherwise follow-up if necessary. The following are reasons that we may collect and maintain your data:

  * Verifying Reports as such circumstances or need may arise – Ripoff Report doesn't verify the accuracy of any post nor the legitimacy of any particular author. Please see our Terms of Service for more information.
  * Providing advertising information for products and services that may be of interest to you.
  * Sending you emails that may pertain to your rights (such as information regarding a subpoena for your identifying author information) or to provide you information about news, scams, tips, resources, etc.
  * Website and system administration.
  * Research and development.
  * Preserving social history as governed by existing US law or policy (archiving information in the public interest).
  * Users filing a Report or Rebuttal may opt-in if they would be willing to be contacted by the media, a consumer advocate, or lawyer to help further their cause or to help with an investigation against a business or an individual. Government agencies may contact you as well for similar purposes, however, as per our Terms of Service, providing such agencies your information is at Xcentric's discretion.



## WHO HAS ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT?

The short answer is certain employees of Xcentric and limited third-party vendors or associates utilized by or connected to Xcentric. Unless you opt-in as mentioned above or as otherwise outlined in our Terms of Service in the section relating to the "Disclosure of Information Supplied by You" which includes our assisting government agencies or other ways that you may lose anonymity privileges, we keep the information within the company. At the same time, third-party vendors hired by Xcentric to assist with administration or maintenance of website systems and/or communications systems may be provided with access to databases and storage that contain such information as deemed necessary by Xcentric. Similarly, we may engage third-party associates to provide you information and products that you may be interested in.

Of the information we do collect, outside of a display name or information that you publish to the public via writing a post, or unless otherwise stated herein or as explained in our Terms of Service, we do not provide our visitors with access to information we collect. People cannot just email us and ask for your information – it doesn't work like that. We might, however, email you on a third-party's behalf. For example, there may be a situation where other consumers are trying to get in touch with other victims.

If you believe that our website has collected incorrect information or if you would like to dispute any information, please contact us using the address at the top of this page.

## USE OF COOKIES

The Ripoff Report website may use "cookies" and other technologies to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Ripoff Report pages, or register with Ripoff Report site or services, a cookie helps Ripoff Report to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Ripoff Report website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Ripoff Report features that you customized.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Ripoff Report services or websites you visit.

## SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

Ripoff Report makes efforts to secure your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.

Xcentric does not actively target citizens of the countries applicable to GDPR though people may have used Ripoff Report to complain about perceived wrongdoings of people, and/or in connection with businesses, located in one or more the GDPR countries. Xcentric, through display on Ripoff Report, permanently archives this data as a matter of public interest, free expression, historical research and the exercise of and defense of any potential legal claims.

Xcentic is engaging in geo-blocking efforts due to GDPR and we no longer allow citizens of countries that are applicable to GDPR to user our website. If any citizen of a country that is bound by GDPR is using this site, they are doing so without our consent and assume the risks, including accepting our data collection practices by doing so without any liability to Xcentric. In other words, we aren't going to be liable because you choose to break the rules.

The United States has not sought nor received a finding of "adequacy" from the European Union under Article 45 of the GDPR. Any data that we are collecting and/or processing we deem to be done with your consent; to perform a contract with you; or to fulfill a compelling legitimate interest of Ripoff Report and/or to the public that we do not believe outweigh your rights and freedoms.

Xcentric retains the data **permanently** (although there is a possibility that some data maybe lost due to technological transitions or other accidental errors). This is due to Xcentric's need to preserve historical evidence in the event of litigation, to provide historical data where relevant, including the consumer facing information, to provide information that is of legitimate interest to the public just as court records are and to promote free expression. If you do not consent to this permanent storage of such information, do not use Ripoff Report.
