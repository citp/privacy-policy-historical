**Reading Is Fundamental, Inc. (RIF) is committed to protecting the privacy of website visitors. We are dedicated to safeguarding all personal information collected online and helping our website visitors learn how to protect their personal information in cyberspace.**

**Personal Data  
** RIF will not collect personally identifiable information about you — your name, address, email address, or telephone number — unless you provide it to us voluntarily.  Whenever we do collect personally identifiable information from you, we will explicitly notify you that we are doing so and we will provide you an opportunity to: 

  * "opt out" of having your information stored and used for any reason other than follow-up correspondence with you from us 


  * restrict how this information is being used by indicating your preferences on the form we use to collect information. 



RIF uses the collected information to improve the content of the RIF website, notify RIF visitors of web updates, and validate visitors' RIF affiliation to allow them to access select RIF resources.  

Please be aware that websites linked to our site may collect information about you when you arrive on their sites. The information practices of those websites linked to the RIF site are not covered by this privacy statement. 

Security Precautions   
In addition to the security measures in place for protecting your personal data (as mentioned above), RIF provides protection to those who are using online credit card transactions to donate to RIF. 

SSL encryption is used for all transactions. Also, encrypted credit card numbers and passwords, as well as other donor information are kept in a physically secure environment with strict policies that minimize staff access to the information contained therein. The Card Security Code is only used for credit card processing and is not stored on the servers. To read the detailed security policy regarding online donations, [please click here.](https://dnbweb1.blackbaud.com/OPXREPHIL/Privacy.asp?cguid=B30C35A2%252D69A1%252D40EE%252DB768%252D5DD9BD7B0808&sid=A8E12458%252D521D%252D4924%252DB060%252DCFFF7FE1C0B5)

Please note, unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100-percent secure. As a result, RIF cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. After we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to protect your personal information on our systems. 

**Children's Privacy** / RIF Reading Planet Privacy Policy  
RIF is very concerned with children's privacy.  Generally, when using the RIF Reading Planet website, keep these tips in mind: 

  * RIF encourages parents and caregivers to spend time online with children. Participate in the interactive activities with them. 
  * Make sure children use ONLY their first name when participating in online activities. 
  * Visitors' email addresses are never posted on RIF Reading Planet. 



Your RIF Reading Planet account information is password-protected, so that you, and only you, have access to this personal information. We recommend that you not give your password to anyone.

Some personal information is gathered when you register with the free RIF Reading Planet Club. During RIF Reading Planet Club registration, you are asked to enter your name, email address, and other personal information.
