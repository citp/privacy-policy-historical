# Tenor Privacy Policy

  


### Effective Date: March 10, 2018

Tenor (“Tenor”, “we,” “us,” or “our”) is committed to respecting the privacy of your personal information as a user of our mobile and desktop applications and extensions (the “Apps”) or a visitor to our website (the “Site”) and the associated services, including the our services provided by us through third party offerings, such as social networks or messaging applications (our Apps, the Site and the associated services are collectively called the “Services”).

This Privacy Policy explains what information Tenor collects from users of its Services and how we may use that information and addresses related questions. By registering for an online account with us, or using any of our Services, you agree and consent to this Privacy Policy. The Tenor Terms of Service at  [http://tenor.com/legal-terms](https://web.archive.org/legal-terms) contain additional terms and conditions governing your use of the Services.

### Overview of the Tenor Services

Tenor provides Apps which users can use to insert GIFs and videos into messages, posts and web pages within messaging applications, email clients or other ways of communication and messaging. Tenor’s Apps also include alternative keyboards for mobile devices and input extensions on mobile devices and computers, which may be activated by hotkey or otherwise contextually activated. The Tenor Apps may access information on your device in order to function, but that information is not transmitted to or collected by Tenor, except as stated in this Privacy Policy.

Tenor also provides Services to allow third party offerings such as social networks, messaging networks, and other applications (such as dating applications and games) to integrate GIFs and videos into the messaging interfaces of those third party offerings, without separately installing a Tenor App.

Tenor does not collect information that a user enters into the text entry field of their device unless the user has invoked the Tenor App, which will be clearly indicated when using the Tenor App. Upon invocation, the Tenor Apps will either use the text entry field as a search input area or will present a separate search input area to search for GIFs and videos. Tenor does, as described in this Privacy Policy, collect information that a user enters into the input area for searching Tenor’s content library.

When you install the Tenor App on your iOS device, you will be asked to provide the App with "Full Access", which means that the Tenor App will have full access to the internet, which is necessary for Tenor to respond to search requests and to deliver GIFs and videos to you. Tenor does not log keystrokes or send them to our servers other than to search by key terms for the GIF and videos relevant to your search requests. Nevertheless, Apple displays its standard warning about "Full Access" whenever you grant it.

When you install the Tenor App on your Android device, you will be asked to provide the App with permission to use the Accessibility Settings, which the Tenor App requires in order to insert GIFs and videos into your messages. The Tenor App will also require internet access, which is necessary for Tenor to respond to search requests and to deliver GIFs and videos to you. Tenor does not log keystrokes or send them to our servers other than to search by key terms for GIF and videos relevant to your search requests.

### Information that Tenor Avoids Collecting

Tenor recommends you use your device’s standard keyboard whenever entering credit card numbers, passwords or other sensitive information. If you enter any of this information into the Tenor’s content library search input area, Tenor will receive it. We use reasonable efforts to remove this type of information from our records, but cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so.

### What Happens to the GIFs and Videos that I Upload to Tenor?

You may upload GIFs and Videos to Tenor through the Tenor Apps and Site. When you upload a GIF or Video, the GIF is "Personal" and is initially stored on your device for use later on that device. Once you create an account and log in to your account, your GIFs and Videos will be stored in Tenor's service and your GIFs and Videos will be available on any other devices logged into that account. If you decide to add a tag or tags to your GIF or Video, your GIF or Video, along with the associated tags, will be submitted to Tenor for review and, if approved, will become part of the Tenor content library and "Published" for use by other users of the Tenor Services. If you added a tag or tags to your GIFs or Videos prior to logging into your account, the GIF and Videos, and the associated tags, will be automatically submitted to Tenor upon logging into your account. Do not tag GIFs or Videos if you do not wish them to be Published and associated with your Account profile. When your GIF or Video is Published, it will be available to other users of the Tenor Services, your username and other Account profile information will be displayed alongside the GIF or Video, and Tenor users will be able to search for other GIFs and Videos you have uploaded based on your username.

GIFs and Videos are not encrypted or hosted on a private URL, which means it is possible for others to figure out how to access your GIFs and Videos, even if Personal. Do not store any GIFs or Videos on Tenor that you do not wish others to be able to access or which you do not wish others to be able to associate with you.

### Account Profiles

As part of our Services, Users may, including by Publishing User Content or creating published collections of Content, display their Account profile to other Users and to the public. We encourage you to use your good judgment about what you place in your Account profile and not to post any private or sensitive information.

### Does Tenor Use Cookies or Collect Analytic Information About Me Or My Devices?

We use cookies, tracking pixels and similar technologies on our Sites, Apps and emails (including in GIFs/Videos)to collect and use information that helps us provide our Services to you. Cookies are a feature of browsers that enable websites to store a small piece of data on your device when you visit them. Tracking pixels are small graphic images embedded in email messages or in advertisements and sponsored content to track user interaction with email messages were opened and to track the views, actions and other performance statistics regarding advertising and sponsored content.

We use cookies to remember your information and preferences so that you do not need to re-enter them (e.g., to remember whether you are logged in), to provide personalized content, and to help us provide the Services to you (such as the ability to submit feedback to us). We also use cookies and similar technologies to help us understand how you use the emails and Services, and whether and when you view GIFS/Videos, so that we can more effectively communicate with you and improve our offerings, and as described in the section below titled “Use of Information in Advertising”. These technologies can give us insights such as how you arrived at our Sites, how long you stayed and which pages you visited. We use analytics technologies from third parties such as Google Analytics. (For Google’s privacy practices see  <https://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html> and to opt out of data recording and analysis by Google Analytics on our Sites, see  <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout>.)

You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings on your web browser. Major mobile operating systems also enable you to limit certain online functionality and data collection. However, if you disable these functions, your experience with our offerings may be significantly limited. If you choose not to receive tracking pixels in your emails, you will need to disable HTML images in your email program, but that may affect images in other emails you receive.

We may also collect advertising identifiers from your mobile device. Advertising identifiers are resettable identifiers unique to your mobile device, and which are used in connection with advertising delivered to your mobile device. Examples of advertising identifiers include IDFA (developed by Apple for the iPhone) and Google Ad ID (developed by Google for Android). Advertising identifiers are used to provide targeted advertising and otherwise for the purposes described in the section below titled “Collection and Use of Advertising-related Information”. If you don’t want advertising identifiers to be used to provide targeted advertising to you, see the section below titled “Can I Opt Out of Targeted Advertising?”

### Use of Information in Advertising

We may use the Services to provide advertisements and/or sponsored GIFs/Videos that are likely to be more interesting and more relevant to users. One way we may do this is by collecting information related to users, which may include elements like the search terms you have provided to the Service, GIFs/Videos you have shared or viewed, preferences that you may have provided to us, advertising identifiers, or location information (i.e. GPS or Wi-Fi data if you have enabled those services). 

We may also use the information we have collected through the Services in order to:

  * Measure the performance of advertising campaigns and/or sponsored GIFs/Videos, whether displayed within our Services or through third party publishers, web sites, mobile applications, and other properties;
  * Limit the number of times a specific advertisement is presented to the same browser or mobile device (frequency capping);
  * Create customized performance reports (for example, how well a particular advertisement or sponsored GIF/Video is performing in a particular geographic region or among a particular demographic); and
  * Improve the targeting or relevance of advertising and/or sponsored GIFs/Videos to users; and
  * Provide non-personally identifiable information to our advertisers or content sponsors to report to them with respect any of the foregoing.



### Can I Opt Out of Targeted Advertising?

If you wish to "opt out" of certain advertising targeted using the types of techniques described above, you have several choices:

  * Visit  [www.networkadvertising.org/choices](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices) or  [www.aboutads.info/choices/](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).
  * Reset your mobile device’s advertising identifier or set it to opt out of targeted advertising.
    * Android: You can reset your advertising ID at any time, right from the Ads section of the Google Settings app on your device. From the same app, you can also opt-out of targeted advertising based on the advertising ID by setting the appropriate ad tracking preference.
    * iOS: You can opt out of targeted advertising by electing Limit Ad Tracking in your device’s settings menu (as of the date of this Privacy Policy, located at Settings > Privacy > Advertising).



You should be aware that if you “opt out” it does not mean that you will no longer receive advertising. It just means that the advertising you see displayed will not be customized to you and your interests and may be less relevant to you.

### Do Not Track

Our Site does not have the capability to respond to “Do Not Track” signals received from various web browsers.

### Will Tenor Contact Me?

If you have provided us with your email address, from time to time, we may want to contact you by email with information about product announcements, software updates and offers.

### How Secure is My Information with Tenor?

Protecting the security of your information is important to us. We use commercially reasonable actions to protect your information, including security measures in the Services to prevent loss, misuse, and alteration of your information. However, we cannot assure against any such loss, misuse, or alteration. The security of information stored locally on your device depends on your use of security functionality on that device. So, we recommend that you protect against unauthorized access to your passwords and devices.

We may change this Privacy Policy by posting a revised version on the Sites and/or an update in the Apps, and/or by sending information regarding the change to your e-mail address in our records. We suggest that you regularly review the Apps and/or Sites to learn about any changes.
