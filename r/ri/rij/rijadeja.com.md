**Third-Party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites:**

The Website may be linked to internet websites operated by other companies. Some of these websites may be co-branded with our name or logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by us. R.I.Jadeja.com may also permit other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Website. These third-party ad servers or ad networks may use technology to send, directly to your browser, some of the advertisements and links that appear on the Website. These advertisers may automatically receive your IP address if this happens. These advertisers may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content.

You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party websites and third party ad servers or ad networks.

**Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy:**

Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, R.I.Jadeja.com does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information on the Website from persons under 13 years-of-age unless R.I.Jadeja.com reasonably believes the child’s parent has consented to the use of the Website. If R.I.Jadeja.com learns that personally-identifiable information of persons less than 13-years-of-age has been collected on the Website without parental consent, then R.I.Jadeja.com will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under the age of 13 has a registered account with the Website, then you may alert R.I.Jadeja.com at [info@rijadeja.com](mailto:info@rijadeja.com) and request that R.I.Jadeja.com delete that child’s personal information from its systems.

This Privacy Policy may be revised periodically without further notice to you and this will be reflected by a “Last Updated” date above. Please revisit this page to stay aware of any changes. Your continued use of the Website constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any future revisions.
