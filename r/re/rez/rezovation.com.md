Where you have expressly provided consent online when asked to do so, we may also use Your Personal Information to communicate information to You about our products and services and to improve our understanding of the needs of potential and existing users of our services.

### 3\. Collection, use & retention of Personal Information

We collect, use and retain Personal Information about you only to the extent that is reasonably required to conduct our business effectively.

The information collected by Us varies depending on the service you request from us.

We may collect personal details such as but not limited to Your name, address, accommodation details, credit/debit card number and expiry date, billing details and telephone numbers (“Personal Information”) either when You use Our Communication Facility, or when You use Our Booking Service. Your credit/debit card details are only used to process the transaction You have requested, and are NOT stored or used in any other way by Us.

We may also collect Personal Information directly from You when You speak to Us over the telephone or send Us correspondence or submit an accommodation review or a review of Our services.

We use Personal Information to complete transactions on Your behalf and to ensure that we can efficiently manage and track transactions that are processed through Our system. We also use Personal Information to monitor Our system’s efficiency and usability, and to test and develop enhancements and changes to the way We do business.

We may also collect Your Personal Information when we undertake market research, or ask a third party to undertake market research on Our behalf, in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. When You agree to participate in any such market research, and give us consent to Use Your Personal Information where asked to do so, Your Personal Information shall remain confidential in compliance with the terms of this Privacy Policy, and shall be used for the sole purpose of improving our services to You, or analysing, compiling and publishing general market trends. For the avoidance of doubt, published market trend information shall be provided at aggregate level only and shall not disclose any Personal Information.

The Personal Information that We collect is stored securely on servers in our United Kingdom and processed by our staff based in the United Kingdom, in Tunisia and the European Union. The Personal Information we collect may also be accessed by staff outside the European Economic Area (EEA) who work for us, including our affiliated subsidiary in Tunisia.

The Personal Information we collect may also be shared with third parties where this is necessary to process and complete Bookings or payment transactions on Your behalf, to fulfil Our contractual obligation to You, or allow the relevant third parties to fulfil their obligations to You in providing the service You requested. Such third parties may be located outside the EEA and may store the data we share with them outside the EEA. Third parties may include without limitations:-

If You are an accommodation provider or business partner concerned with the protection of Your Personal Information, We recommend that you use a distinct separate business email, business address, business phone line and business bank account rather than use Your personal data.

Should You, as an accommodation provider or business partner, choose to provide Personal Information to Us in response to a specific request for business contact details (for example a business email, address, and phone number), You understand and agree that any Personal Information provided in this context shall be deemed to be Your business contact data, and Your consent to its use as business information, and that this data will NOT be protected by the provisions of this Privacy Policy and GDPR.
