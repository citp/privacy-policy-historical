# Privacy Policy : Rezdy

Rezdy collects different information about the various parties who may utilize its services. This includes information about suppliers, consumers, agents and resellers. There are 6 broad categories of information that we collect:

When you first sign up or contract with Rezdy for our services, or when you make an inquiry about our services, we request information such as your name, address, telephone number, domain name, email details of your primary and secondary contacts, credit card details (if you are paying online). We may also ask for your age and gender. We may also monitor and/or record telephone conversations with you from time to time in order to train staff and to improve our service to you.
  * Non personally identifying information. In addition to the information you specifically provide above, Rezdy operates statistics gathering software on its web site to collect information about the number of visitors coming to the site. No identifying information is collected by this software. The software records the IP address of the visitor only. We use this information to improve our own technical structure and performance, and to determine which areas of our web site are most popular. We also use ‘cookies’. Cookies are pieces of information that a web site can transfer to an individual’s computer in order to allow that web site to store information about user preferences. We use cookies that expire once the visitor leaves our web site. Cookies are used to collect session ID’s. It is possible to adjust your Internet browser to refuse cookies, but you may find that this reduces the functionality of this site.
  * Other demographic information. If you respond voluntarily to our surveys or other interactive communications, we collect the responses and use the information to improve the quality and range of Rezdy’s products and services.
  * Personal information stored on a web site hosted by Rezdy. Rezdy will have personal information stored on our servers due to the fact that we host web sites of other organizations. Any information that is submitted to or collected by these organizations will be physically located on a Rezdy server. This information, whether voluntarily provided or not, will not be used or released by Rezdy in any manner, and it will be kept strictly confidential, unless we are required to release the information by law.
  * Information about consumers. Rezdy may gather and store information about consumers and their transactions in connection with the provision of its services.
