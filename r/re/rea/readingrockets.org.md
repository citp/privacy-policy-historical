# WETA.org Privacy Policy | WETA

Thank you for visiting a WETA website. WETA is committed to protecting your privacy and maintaining your trust. WETA.org, AdLit.org, AmericanGraduateDC.org, BrainLine.org, BrainLineMilitary.org, BrainLineKids.org, ColorinColorado.org, inReads.com, LDOnline.org, ReadingRockets.org, all WETA hosted Blogs (i.e. Telly Visions) and any other website held or hereafter created by WETA* (the “WETA Websites,” the “Websites” or “WETA”) protect your privacy by adhering to a strict privacy policy.

The information gathered by the WETA Websites falls into two categories: (1) information voluntarily supplied by visitors to the WETA Websites and (2) tracking information routinely gathered as visitors navigate through the WETA Websites.

## Voluntarily-Supplied Information: 

You may visit the WETA Websites without voluntarily supplying any personally identifiable information about yourself. The WETA Websites do not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you voluntarily provide that information. To make use of certain features on the WETA Websites, such as Contact Us forms, subscribing to various newsletters, or supporting WETA with a monetary donation, you will need to provide your personally identifiable information. The information you supply will help us to offer you more personalized features, to tailor our sites to your interests and make them more useful to you. Supplying such information is entirely voluntary. But if you don't supply the information, we may be unable to provide you with services that are available to others. 

### Email and Email Newsletters

WETA may collect personal information from you in connection with Email and Email newsletters. Subscribing is entirely optional, but you must provide some personally identifying information, such as your email address, to do so. This information will be used as indicated at the time you provide the information.

### Supporting WETA

Most of WETA’s Websites** offer you the opportunity to make a donation in support of WETA, or a particular project of WETA. To make a donation online, you must provide personally identifiable information including, but not limited to, your name, address, and credit card number. To provide the highest level of security possible to protect your personally identifiable information, WETA hires trusted third parties to process your donations via credit card. We require these select third parties to hold your personally identifiable information in strict confidence. These third parties were selected for their high security standards, and they understand WETA’s expectation that they will treat your personally identifiable information confidentially and responsibly. You will know that you have left a WETA Website and entered the website of a trusted third party by looking at the URL of the web page you are viewing. 

### Forums, Feedback, and Other Submissions

The WETA Websites may offer you various opportunities to interact with WETA or other visitors to the Websites, such as with online forums, bulletin boards, feedback forms, surveys, or contests. WETA may require that you submit select personally identifiable information to participate in these opportunities for interaction. For example, you must complete a free registration process, which requires select personally identifiable information, to participate in online forums. Your participation and submission of personally identifiable information in connection with your participation will always be optional, however, if you choose not to provide your personally identifiable information, you may not be eligible to participate in these activities. 

### Privacy of Children

Maintaining the privacy of children is a priority to WETA. The policy of the WETA Websites is to not collect the personally identifiable information of children. Some of the WETA Websites do allow children to participate in Website activities. For example, LD Online provides the opportunity to submit children’s drawings or writings for publication to the site. Parents may request the removal of any work submitted by their child. The WETA Websites do not collect more information from children than is reasonably necessary for the child to participate in activities; entice children, by the prospect of a special game, prize or other activity, to provide more information than is necessary to participate in an activity; or share any personally identifiable information about children with third parties. For more information about the privacy of children please see the [Children’s Privacy Policy](http://www.ldonline.org/kids_privacy).

## Non-Personally Identifiable Information Automatically Collected

WETA and our trusted third parties may automatically collect non-personally identifiable information when you visit the Websites. Non-personally identifiable information includes your IP address, browser and computer platform information, reference site domain, pages you visited on the WETA Websites, and the time of your visit. WETA uses this information to improve our Websites and your experience while visiting the Websites. WETA analyzes the information collected for the overall aggregate trends they reveal about our site visitors, not for the activities of individuals. 

### About Cookies

To improve our Websites and your experience using our Websites, WETA uses a standard technological feature called a “cookie” which helps WETA to collect the non-personally identifiable information described above. At no time will the cookie identify you, or supply your personal information to WETA without your permission. Our online advertisers and trusted third parties may also use cookies to track users experiences on their own web pages, a process that we don't control.

You can set your browser to refuse cookies, to alert you when cookies are used by a website you visit, or to delete the cookies stored on your computer. You do not need to have cookies enabled to use the WETA Websites, however, some features on the Websites will not function properly if you refuse cookies.

## Information Sharing and Sites Beyond WETA

Unless you instruct us otherwise, we may exchange your name and mailing address with other organizations that may interest you.*** You may opt-out of this exchange, or update your contact information by writing to us at: WETA Member Services, 3939 Campbell Avenue, Arlington, VA 22206. You may also contact us via email to [membership@weta.org](mailto:membership@weta.org), or by phone: (703) 998-2724. Some members have already instructed us not to exchange their name and address. If the label on your WETA magazine has an X at the beginning of the coded line, your membership record has already been coded "no exchange."

WETA or WETA’s trusted third parties, may also release your personally identifiable information if we believe in good faith that the law or legal process requires it, we have received a valid administrative request from a law enforcement agency, or such release is necessary to protect a person’s rights, property, or safety.

To make our site more valuable to our visitors, we offer some features in conjunction with other providers, for example links to other websites not managed by WETA. You’ll know that you are no longer on a WETA Website by checking the URL in the location bar on your browser. Websites that are not managed by WETA are not governed by this Privacy Policy, but rather by the policy of the site you’re visiting.

By using this site, you signify your agreement to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, please do not use this site. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes.
