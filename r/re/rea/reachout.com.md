  4. If you choose to voluntarily complete one of the Site’s surveys, we may ask you for certain information to help us understand who is using the Site, including your age, gender, race, ethnicity, satisfaction with the Site, year in school, employment status, etc. These surveys will be voluntary and anonymous, and will not be linked to any Personal Information. 



## 3\. Use of Personal Information

Inspire USA uses Personal Information to fulfil and process the requests of users, including to provide technical support or account maintenance. We may also use this information to provide you with updated information on new projects commenced by Inspire USA, to alert you to special events organized by Inspire USA, to let you know when new content has been added to the site, and to conduct research, surveys or engage in other marketing purposes. 

In relation to the Reach Out Contributing Editor application form and the Special Project Team Member application form, any demographic information we may ask you to provide is used to help us have appropriate age, gender, racial and cultural, and geographic locations represented. 

Subject to the exceptions listed below, Personal Information will only be accessed by Inspire USA management and personnel, Inspire USA’s affiliated entities including the Inspire Foundation, and Inspire USA's contracted service providers and professional advisors, all of whom are bound by this Privacy Policy, and we will not give your personal information to advertisers and other organizations without your express consent. 

In the following circumstances, Inspire USA may disclose your Personal Information without your consent: 

  1. if we believe there is a serious and imminent threat to the life, health or safety of yourself or another person (for example, if we learn that a person is suffering abuse or has made statements of an intent to commit self-harm or harm another); 
  2. to investigate or report on activity which we believe on reasonable grounds to be unlawful; 
  3. if disclosure is required or authorized by law (for example, in response to a subpoena or where a regulatory authority has the power to request the provision of certain records or information); 
  4. if disclosure is reasonably necessary to enable an enforcement body to perform its functions, for example: 
  5.     1. the prevention, detection, investigation, prosecution or punishment of criminal offences; and 
    2. the preparation for, or conduct of, proceedings before any court or tribunal, or implementation of the orders of a court or tribunal.
