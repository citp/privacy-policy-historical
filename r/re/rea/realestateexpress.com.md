**Security**

This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users’ personal information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and transmitted via a secure server.

It encrypts all of your personal information including credit card number, name, and address, so that it cannot be read as the information travels over the Internet.

American School of Real Estate Express, LLC also does everything in its power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users’ information – not just the sensitive information mentioned above – is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. On at least an annual basis, and any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure that our users’ information is protected. 

Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment.

If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users can send an email to [ customercare@realestateexpress.com](mailto:customercare@realestateexpress.com).
