# Privacy | The Hook - Charlottesville's weekly newspaper, news magazine

The Hook values your privacy. We will not request any personally identifying information from you in order to visit our website.

The website contains many hyperlinks to advertisers and to other sites we believe you'll find useful and convenient. However, such non-Hook websites may have separate data and privacy practices independent of us, and therefore we cannot take responsibility or assume liability for their policies or actions.

We reserve the right to change this policy at any time without notice of any kind.

The Hook uses outside service providers for some of our Web site services-- including, but not limited to-- electronic personal ads. We do not control their privacy policies.

While our site's statistical tracking software monitors IP addresses and referring URLs, along with other information about what you view on the site, we do not routinely collect individual information out of these logs. We use the general statistical information to help us understand how users view our site, and we reserve the right to collect and distribute IP addresses, email addresses, and other data whenever sock puppetry or other potential abuse is suspected.

Information we gather will not be sold, lent, rented, or otherwise shown to advertisers or third-party vendors.

The Hook does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13, although we have no way of knowing if a child is posing as an adult. We ask for parents to fill in any online contests or registrations aimed at children.

We typically allow user comments and ask users for their name and their email address in case a comment is questioned or challenged. The comments are not verified or necessarily supported by the journalists at the Hook, but the discussions may be moderated.

For questions or comments, contact the editor, Hawes Spencer, [editor@readthehook.com](mailto:editor@readthehook.com).
