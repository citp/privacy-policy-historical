<h1>Privacy policy</h1>
<p>Read Print (“<strong>Read Print</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>”  or “<strong>we</strong>”) respects the privacy of the users to its Website (“<strong>Users</strong>”),  the home page of which is located at <a href="http://www.readprint.com/">http://www.readprint.com/</a> (“<strong>Website</strong>”). </p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is intended to  inform you of our policies and practices regarding the collection, use and  disclosure of any Personal Information and Anonymous Information you submit to  us through our Website. If you have questions about this policy, email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@readprint.com">privacy@readprint.com</a>.</p>
<p>“<strong>Personal Information</strong>” is  information about you that is personally identifiable to you like your name,  address, e-mail address, or phone number, as well as other non-public information  that is associated with the foregoing.</p>
<p>“<strong>Anonymous Information</strong>” means  information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information;  Anonymous Information does not permit the identification of individual persons. </p>
<p>We collect and use Personal  Information and Anonymous Information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>By submitting  Personal Information through our Website, you agree to the terms of this  Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the processing of your Personal Information  according to this Privacy Policy.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Your Personal  Information may be processed by Read Print in the country where it was  collected as well as other countries (including the United States) where laws  regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the  laws in your country.</strong></p>
<h2>Information  We Collect</h2>
<h4>1. Unregistered Users</h4>
<p>We encourage you to register with us  in order to take advantage of Read Print's many personalization features.  However, you may choose not to register and take advantage of those features of  our Website for which registration is not required.</p>
<p>If you do not register, we will only  collect the following Anonymous Information from you:<br>
  We may log your IP Address in order to  help diagnose problems with our server, administer our Website and track usage  statistics. An “<strong>IP Address</strong>” is a number that is automatically assigned  to your computer when you use the Internet.&nbsp;  In some cases your IP Address stays the same from browser session to  browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP  Address probably varies from session to session</p>
<p>We do not link your IP Address to any  Personal Information to identify you.</p>
<p>If you reached our Website by clicking  on a link or advertisement on another website, we log that information to help us  maximize our Internet exposure, and to understand the interests of our Users.<br>
  All of this information is collected  and used only in the aggregate; that is, it is entered into our database, where  we can use it to generate overall reports on the visitors of our Website, but  not reports about individual Users.</p>
<p>We may also place a Cookie on your  computer. “<strong>Cookies</strong>” are small pieces of  information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are  viewing a website.&nbsp; Read Print may use  both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and  persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to  provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on the Website, to  help us understand how Users use our Website, and to help us to improve our Website.&nbsp; Persistent Cookies can be removed by  following Internet browser help file directions. A Cookie may contain information  that allows us to track your path through our Website and to determine whether  you have visited us before. However, unless you register with us, it does not  contain and is not linked to any Personal Information that would allow us to  identify you. If you choose to disable Cookies, some areas of the Website (and  other websites) may not work properly.</p>
<h4>2. Registered Users</h4>
<p>If you choose to register with us,  you'll be able to add content to our Website. For example, you may post your  own book reviews, create groups and lists as well as participate in our  discussion forums. You will also be able to email content from the Website to  yourself and others and to post information to various third-party websites,  including popular social networks. In addition, you will benefit from the  ability to personalize your Read Print experience.</p>
<p>If you register with us, we will  collect Personal Information from you in addition to the Anonymous Information  described above in the section “Unregistered Users”.<br>
  <br>
  That Personal Information we collect  from you may vary, depending on the features of the Website you use:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you register as a User on the Website, we  will collect &nbsp;a username and password  that you can choose and your e-mail address. If you wish to further personalize  your Read Print account, you can choose what additional information you want to  provide, such as a short biography of yourself, your favorite books, and your  favorite authors, among other things. <strong>Please note that any information that  is stored in your Read Print account (with the exception of your password) can  be seen by other Visitors of the Website, unless we have provided the option  and you have selected it, to hide certain information from select groups of  users on your Account Page. Please be aware of this fact and choose the  information you want to provide accordingly.</strong></li>
  <li>If you send us an email or get in contact  with us using one of our online forms, we collect your email address and the content  of your email or message.</li>
  <li>If you participate in one of our online  surveys, we will collect your response and might also collect additional  information that you may decide to provide, such as, but not limited to, age,  locations and other demographic information.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>We may store Personal Information in a  Cookie on your Computer, so that our Website will recognize you each time you  visit our Website. In that way, we can save your preferences from visit to  visit and present you with a customized Website, without requiring you to log  into our Website every time you visit.</p>
<p>Additionally, authorized Read Print  personnel may update your registration information to accurately reflect any  new information included in communications received from you.</p>
<h2>Use  of Personal Information we collect and your choices</h2>
<p>We use the Personal Information we  collect to personalize our Website so that it is most useful to you. It also  allows you to log into our Website automatically each time you visit, rather  than manually typing your user name and password every time.</p>
<p>We may also use this information to  periodically contact you with news or important information from Read Print or  to request your feedback on our site. In addition to these periodic updates, we  may email you additional materials. These emails might include opt-in  newsletters and other materials that you proactively request from Read Print.<br><br>
  In addition to these communications,  if you have provided an email address, we may use your Personal Information to  send you notifications about special offers or to tell you about opportunities  available from our partners.&nbsp; We will not  provide any of our partners with information about you for their own marketing  purposes, unless you ask us to do so.<br><br>
  In any case, we will only contact you  as set forth above, if you request such communications from us. </p>
<p>When you receive the aforementioned  newsletters or promotional communications from us, you may indicate a  preference to stop receiving further communications from us and you will have  the opportunity to “opt-out” by following the unsubscribe instructions provided  in the email your receive or by contacting us directly (please see contact  information below). You may change any of the Personal Information and your  preferences regarding communications you want to receive from us by accessing  and editing your account by visiting <a href="http://www.readprint.com">http://www.readprint.com</a>, logging  in, and then accessing your Account Page.<br><br>
  Despite  your indicated e-mail preferences, we may send you administrative emails  regarding our services or notices of any updates to our Terms of Use or Privacy  Policy. If you want to opt-out from receiving such administrative emails, you  have to deactivate your registration, as described below.<br><br>
  We may also use certain information  that you provide in order to present you with advertising on our Website that  you may find interesting. We might work together with third-party service  providers to provide you with advertisements on our Website. Please be aware  that clicking on such advertisements might lead you to other websites (please  see the information regarding other websites below) and/or might place a Cookie  on your computer.</p>
<p><strong>Cancellation of  Registration</strong><br>
  You can deactivate your registration  with us by clicking on the link found on your Account Page.&nbsp; We will confirm your request. After we  receive confirmation, we will hide your information from our active database,  but retain your information in our archives and backups so that, in the event  you ever choose to re-activate your account, your old information is not lost.  We may not be able to remove your information from our partners' databases, if  we have transmitted any information to them as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Posting information  to public places</strong><br>
  The idea behind Read Print is that the  members of our community share information and knowledge. Therefore, you should  assume that any information that you enter or post on the Website (not  including the information in your Read Print account, with the exception of  your username), may be openly shared on the Website with other community  members and may also be available to people outside the community. Depending on  where you post your information, you might be able to further specify which  members or group of members of the Read Print community will be able to have  access to this information. Please be aware that if you enter any Personal  Information into publicly available sections of the Website, this information  will be displayed to anyone who has access to these sections. These publicly  available sections of the Website include, without limitation, the discussion forums,  the review pages, comments, groups pages and others. Read Print also reserves  the right to use your username in connection with any information you post to  on the Website.<br><br>
  Members  may also be able to search for publicly available information that was posted  by a Read Print member in public sections of the Website, or for information in  a Read Print account.<br><br>
  We may create Anonymous Information records from  Personal Information by excluding information (such as your name) that makes  the information personally identifiable to you.&nbsp;  We may use this Anonymous Information to analyze usage patterns so that  we may enhance our community.&nbsp; Read Print reserves the right to use and disclose  Anonymous Information to third parties in its discretion. <br><br>
  <strong>Feedback</strong><br>
  If you provide feedback to us, we may  use such feedback for any purpose, provided that we do not associate such  feedback with your Personal Information.&nbsp;  Read Print will collect any information contained in such communication  and will treat the Personal Information in such communication in accordance  with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>Disclosure  of your Personal Information.</h2>
<p>Read Print does not sell or rent any  personal information to any third party, other than our partners, as discussed  in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Although we currently do not have a parent  company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common  control (collectively, “<strong>Affiliates</strong>”), we may in the future. We may share  some of your Personal Information with these Affiliates, in which case we will  require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy. Sharing this information allows  us to better understand the ways in which our various product and service  offerings can assist our Users. It also enables us to provide you with  information about opportunities in which you might be interested.</p>
<p>We also may share your Personal Information  with third parties specifically engaged by Read Print to provide services to Read  Print (such as, but not limited to, market research firms, marketing services  providers and advertising agencies), in which case we will require those  parties to agree to use any such Personal Information solely for the purpose of  providing the specified services to Read Print.</p>
<p>We may disclose your Personal  Information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to  (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on Read  Print; or (b) to protect and defend the rights, safety, or property of Read  Print, users of our Website, or third parties. If our company or our assets are  acquired by another company, that company will possess the Personal Information  collected by us and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your  Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>Steps  we take to protect your personal information.</h2>
<p>Read Print has implemented security  procedures to help protect the personal information stored in our systems. For  example, we limit access to Personal Information about you to employees who we  believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information. We also  employ processes to protect against unauthorized access to your personal  information. However, no company, including Read Print, can fully eliminate  security risks associated with Personal Information.</p>
<h2>Children's  Privacy</h2>
<p>We do not intentionally gather  Personal Information about visitors who are under the age of thirteen (13).</p>
<p><strong>Other websites</strong><br>
  Our provision of links to other websites  or locations is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of  such other websites or location or its contents. Links to other websites or  locations may also be posted by other Read Print members within the Read Print community.  We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible for these  outside websites or their content. Please be aware that the terms of our  Privacy Policy do not apply to these outside websites.</p>
<h2>Changes  to this Privacy Policy.</h2>
<p>This  Privacy Policy is subject to occasional revision, and if we make any  substantial changes in the way we use your Personal Information, we will post  an alert on this page.&nbsp; If you object to  any such changes, you must cease using our Website. Continued use of our  Website following notice of any such changes shall indicate your  acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and  conditions of such changes.</p>
