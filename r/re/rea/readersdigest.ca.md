**Cookies and Server Logs**

Reader's Digest-the publisher of Reader's Digest, Best Health and Our Canada-as well as related web-hosting providers and advertisers sometimes utilize “cookie” technology. Cookies are bits of data stored on your local hard drive which help enhance your web-browsing experience. Not all web browsers accept cookies, and those that do usually provide a preference or setting which allow you to refuse cookies. If your browser does not accept cookies, you may not be able to fully participate in all our web sites' features, including registration and entry into contests, prize draws and sweepstakes.

Server logs capture certain non-personally identifying data, such as the time and date of a web visit, the browser and operating system being used, the IP address or domain name of the user's ISP, and the web URL a user linked from. The cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us, e.g., your email address, in hashed, non-readable form. This information is used in aggregate form to help us plan system enhancements when necessary and to provide content which is compatible with our visitors' web browsing systems. To opt-out of these cookies or learn more please go to [ **http://aboutads.info/choices**](http://aboutads.info/choices) or [**http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp**](https://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

Additionally, emails we send may contain a bit of code known as a “web beacon.” This code allows us to understand the time and date of when a user has opened an email and when he/she has utilized a link within the email to visit a website. Our web beacons do not collect personally identifiable information. Users wishing to disable our web beacons should do so by turning images “off” in their email client (e.g., Outlook, Outlook Express). Please see your email client for more information.”
