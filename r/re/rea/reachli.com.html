<p><b style="font-size: 20px;">Reachli’s Privacy Principles</b></p>
<p>Reachli recognizes the importance of protecting the personal information  that it holds. This policy outlines Reachli’s policies and procedures regarding  its collection, use, retention and disclosure of such personal information.</p>
<p>In the course of its business activities and, in particular, in  facilitating Members’ access to the Reachli Site and Reachli Services, Reachli  collects personal information about its Members.</p>
<p><strong>Defined Terms</strong>. Several of the important terms used in this Privacy Policy, including  "Member", "Reachli", "Reachli Services", "Reachli Site", and "Vendor" are  defined in Reachli’s "General Terms of Use for Members and Vendors".</p>
<p><strong>Personal Information Only</strong>:&nbsp; Reachli’s  privacy principles apply only to personal information about identifiable  individuals. They do not apply to business information, such as the name,  title, business address or telephone number of an owner or employee of an  organization.</p>
<p><strong>Why Reachli Collects Personal Information: </strong>Reachli primarily collects personal information to  permit communication with Members regarding the Reachli Site and Reachli  Services.</p>
<p>Reachli may also collect personal information for purposes related but  secondary to our primary purposes, for example, to process credit card payments  or to collect unpaid accounts, to advise clients about new products or  services, to advise clients and others of special events or available  opportunities, and to review delivery of the Reachli Site and Reachli Services  to maintain quality control.</p>
<p>We use your  personally identifiable information: (a) to send you information regarding Reachli  Services and your subscription to the Services; (b) to track your compliance  with the Reachli "General Terms of Use for Members  and Vendors"; and/or (c) for validation, suppression,  content improvement and feedback purposes. </p>
<p>You agree that  we may contact you at any time with updates and/or any other information that  we may deem appropriate for you to receive in connection with your continued  use of the Services and request for information regarding additional Reachli products  and/or services.</p>
<p><strong>How We Collect Personal Information:&nbsp; </strong>Reachli  only collects personal information by lawful means, and only that which is  reasonably necessary for the stated purposes. In almost all cases, and whenever  possible, we collect personal information about Members directly from Members.</p>

<p class="mt20"><b style="font-size: 20px;">How We Use Personal Information:</b></p>
<p>For each visitor  to our Web page, our Web server automatically recognizes the consumer's domain  name and e-mail address (where possible). </p>
<p>We use cookies  to store visitors preferences, record session information, such as items that  consumers add to their shopping cart, record user-specific information on what  pages users access or visit, record past activity at a site in order to provide  better service when visitors return to our site, customize Web page content  based on visitors' browser type or other information that the visitor sends.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Reachli may use personal information to: provide access to the Reachli  Site and Reachli Services; manage and develop Reachli’s business and  operations; learn about the needs of current and potential Members; develop or  offer services and products tailored to these needs and communicate with these  clients regarding current and future Services; respond to and follow up on  Visitor and Member inquiries, comments and suggestions; address financial  matters including billing and record-keeping for audit and account collection  purposes; and report illegal, unethical or other serious and unacceptable  misconduct on the part of Members.</p>
<p><strong>Disclosure of Personal Information</strong>:&nbsp; Under  normal circumstances,<strong> </strong>Reachli will  only disclose personal information for purposes related to the provision of one  or more Reachli Services to a Member, or with the express consent of such  Member, or if required or authorized by law. If Reachli or its assets were to  be sold, the prospective purchaser would normally conduct a "due diligence"  review of Reachli’s records. This could involve a review of Reachli’s files,  including personal information. Any such review would be subject to strict  confidentiality provisions and would not permit the recording or removal of any  personal information.</p>
<p><strong>Consent to Collection, Use and Disclosure:&nbsp; </strong>We may  obtain a person’s consent to the collection, use and disclosure of his or her  information either expressly, for stated purposes (such as in a Membership  application or a request for information about the Reachli Site and Reachli  Services), or implicitly, such as when the purposes are indicated by the  relevant circumstances. Any such consent may be withdrawn or amended by  contacting Reachli’s privacy staff (<a href="mailto:privacy@reachli.com">privacy@reachli.com</a>)  and subject to any legal or contractual restrictions and upon reasonable notice  to Reachli. For example, if a person tells us that he or she no longer wishes  to receive information about the Reachli Site and Reachli Services, we will  comply with said request.</p>
<p>A person’s consent to Reachli’s collection of certain personal  information may be required for Reachli to provide the Reachli Site and Reachli  Services. However, Reachli will not require, as a condition of providing access  to the Reachli Site or Reachli Services, that any personal information  unrelated to Reachli be collected.</p>
<p><strong>Reachli Partners and Sponsors:</strong> Some Reachli Services are offered to Visitors and  Members in conjunction with a non-affiliated partner or sponsor. To provide  Visitors and Members some of these Reachli Services, the partner may need to  collect and maintain personal information. Reachli will share non-identifying  and aggregate information, but not personal information, with such partners in  order to administer the co-branded products or services offered. </p>
<p><strong>Responses to Email Inquiries:</strong> When Visitors or Members send email inquiries to  Reachli, the return email address is used to respond. Reachli does not use the  return email address for any other purpose and does not store or share the  return email address with any third party.</p>
<p><strong>Voluntary Member Surveys</strong>: We may conduct both business and individual  Member surveys. We encourage Members to participate in these surveys as they  provide us with information that enables us to improve Reachli Services and how  we provide them to you. Your personal information and responses will remain  strictly confidential even if the survey is conducted by a third party.  Participation in our Member surveys is always voluntary. </p>
<p>We take the information we receive from Members responding to Member  Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it to create broader, general responses to  the survey questions (data such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education,  employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). We then use the  aggregated information to improve the quality of current Reachli Services and  new ones. This aggregated information may be shared with third parties. </p>
<p><strong>Special Cases</strong>: In exceptional circumstances, Reachli may disclose personal  information about Visitors or Members, or information regarding your use of the  Reachli Services or Reachli Site, if, in our sole discretion, we believe that  it is reasonable to do so, including: to obey laws, regulations, or  governmental or legal requests for such information; to disclose information  that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone  who may be violating our Terms of Use or other policies; to operate the Reachli  Services properly; or to protect Reachli and our Members and Vendors.</p>
<p><strong>Use of "Cookies"</strong>: A "cookie" is a small data file that  can be placed on the hard drive of a person who visits a Website such as the  Reachli Site. Reachli may use cookies to collect, store, and track information  for statistical purposes to improve the Reachli Services and to manage our  networks. If you are a Member, we will use a cookie to save your settings and  provide customizable and personalized services. These cookies do not enable  third parties to access any of your Member information. Additionally, be aware  that if you visit websites that are linked to the Reachli Site, you may be  required to accept cookies. Non-affiliated partners or sponsors may also use  cookies. Reachli does not control use of these cookies and expressly disclaims  responsibility for information collected through them. </p>
<p><strong>No Privacy Here:&nbsp; </strong>Member acknowledges that in general, other than  personal information provided to Reachli to set up a Reachli account, all  messages, comments, questions and other information and communications  submitted or posted by a Member to any part of the Reachli Site (collectively,  "Communications"), presently or in the future, such as message boards,  discussion groups, blogs and other communications facilities available to  Members or Vendors (collectively, "Communities"), are public and not private  Communications, and that others may access and read such Communications without  the knowledge or consent of Member. If any of the Communities permits the  submission of Communications on a confidential basis, that fact will be stated on  the web page for such Communities.</p>
<p><strong>Retention and Destruction of Personal Information</strong>:&nbsp; It is  expected that some Members will enjoy the Reachli Site and Reachli Services  over a period of months or years, and it can be useful not only for Reachli but  also for such Member that their personal information is to be kept on file.  Reachli therefore may retain a person’s Member’s personal information for up to  five years after their last contact with Reachli. This ensures that Reachli is  able to answer questions about the Reachli Site and Reachli Services previously  provided.</p>
<p>Inactive Member files will be destroyed after five years, unless Reachli  receives a request to destroy them earlier. Paper files containing personal  information will generally be destroyed by shredding. Electronic information  will be deleted from electronic files (server logs and databases) where it is  stored, and, when the hardware is discarded, Reachli will ensure that the hard  drive is physically destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>Updating, Correcting, or Deleting Information:&nbsp; </strong>Since Reachli uses a Member’s personal  information to provide him or her with access to the Reachli Site and Reachli  Services, it is important that such information be accurate and complete. If  any of your personal information changes or you would like to delete your  account, please inform us so that we can make any necessary changes. Simply send your request via e-mail to: <a href="mailto:team@reachli.com">team@reachli.com</a>.</p>
<p>We will process your request, where possible and subject to  the terms and conditions contained herein, within a reasonable period of time  after receipt. To protect your privacy and security, we will take reasonable  steps to help verify your identity before granting access or making  corrections.</p>
<p><strong>Security of Personal Information:&nbsp; </strong>Reachli  uses appropriate security measures to protect against loss, theft, unauthorized  access, disclosure, use or modification of personal information. Such measures  will vary depending on the sensitivity, amount, format, nature and storage of  the personal information and will involve, as applicable, physical,  organizational and electronic security measures, including premises security,  restricted file access to personal information, technological safeguards  including security software and firewalls to prevent unauthorized computer  access, and password and security policies. Members should be aware that  Reachli cannot ensure the security of personal information transmitted by  regular email, which is not a fully secure medium. Reachli requires that  Vendors and third party service providers to whom personal information may be  transferred provide a level of security for such personal information that  meets standards established by Reachli.
</p>
<p><strong>Access to Personal Information:&nbsp; </strong>We will  respond promptly to any request for access to your personal information. There  will be no cost for reasonable requests to such access, unless you request  copies of records or your request involves significant retrieval costs. We will  advise you of the cost, if any, prior to retrieving such records or information.  Reachli will not respond to requests for access to personal information that  are frivolous, vexatious or repetitious. </p>
<p>In certain circumstances, we may be unable to provide access to some or  all of the personal information that we hold about you. Such circumstances  include those in which the personal information cannot be separated from the  records of others, or cannot be disclosed for reasons of personal security or  commercial confidentiality.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to our Privacy Policy:&nbsp; </strong>As part  of our regular review of all of our policies and procedures, we may revise our  privacy policy from time to time and may use customer  information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy  notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will  contact you before we use your data for these new purposes to notify you of the  policy change and to provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses.</p>
<p>Customers may prevent their  information from being used for purposes other than those for which it was  originally collected by e-mailing us <a href="mailto:privacy@reachli.com">privacy@reachli.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Reachli’s Website:</strong>&nbsp; The Reachli Site may contain  links to other websites, which are not governed by our privacy policy. On the  Reachli Site, as with most other commercial websites, we may monitor traffic  patterns, site usage and related site information in order to optimize our web  service. We may provide aggregated information to third parties, but these  statistics do not include any identifiable personal information.</p>
<p><strong>Questions, Concerns, Requests for Access: </strong>If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy, wish to access your personal information, or wish  to change your preferences regarding our use of your information, please  contact us at: <a href="mailto:privacy@reachli.com">privacy@reachli.com</a>.</p>
