Otherwise, we will ask the company and organization to seek your authorization again.

We only share your personal information for legitimate, rightful, necessary, specific, and explicit purposes, and only share the personal information necessary to provide the service. Our partners do not have the right to use shared personal information for any other purpose.

**VI How do we protect your personal information**

For example, only the summary of personal biometric information will be stored.
