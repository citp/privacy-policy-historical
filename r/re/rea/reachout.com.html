                <li>to investigate or report on activity which we believe on reasonable grounds to be unlawful</li>
                <li>if disclosure is required or authorized by law (for example, in response to a subpoena or where a regulatory authority has the power to request the provision of certain records or information)</li>
                <li>if disclosure is reasonably necessary to enable an enforcement body to perform its functions, for example: <br>
                    <ul>
                    <li>the prevention, detection, investigation, prosecution or punishment of criminal offences; and</li>

            <p>You may have the option to publicly post or otherwise disclose your Personal Information in certain portions of the Site. Any information that is posted or otherwise disclosed in these areas becomes public information. You post such Personal Information on the Site at your own risk.  Please exercise caution when deciding to disclose Personal Information to others.

           <p><strong class="fs16">5. Security of information</strong></p>
           <p>Inspire USA will take reasonable steps to ensure your Personal Information is protected from modification, misuse, disclosure, loss and unauthorized access.  While Inspire USA will take reasonable precautions against potential breaches of your Personal Information, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure.  Consequently, Inspire USA cannot, and does not, guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, disclosure, misuse, modification or any other breaches will not occur.  Inspire USA urges you to take steps to keep your personal information safe by memorizing your password or keeping it in a safe place, and logging out of your online user account and closing your web browser after you are finished using the Site.</p>
           
           <p><strong class="fs16">6. Cookies and session information</strong></p>
           <p>Cookies are pieces of information that a site sends to your computer's hard disk when you access information on that site.  Each time you use your computer to access the same site, the information that was previously received is sent back to the site by your browser.  We use session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in. These cookies terminate once you close the browser.  Cookies do not identify individual users.  However, when you visit the Site, our servers may record information about your usage, the time of your visit, its duration, the pages you visit and style settings.  If you do not agree to the use of cookies, you can set the preferences on your browser to remove all cookies and reject cookies in the future.</p>
           <p>Inspire USA may use information to publish aggregate statistics about usage, registration, traffic patterns and other related site information that does not personally identify users.  This is important to ensure that our content and services continue to meet the general needs of our users.  This information that we collect about your use of the Site will remain anonymous and will not be linked to any Personal Information.</p>
           <p>You may have the option to register and login as a member of the Site, in which case your preferred style settings will be linked to your member name and password.  This login information is retained from session to session unless you change your member name or password.</p>
           
           <p><strong class="fs16">7. Third-party links</strong></p>
           <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by Inspire USA through the Site.  From time to time, the Site may provide links to third-party websites.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party websites, whether or not the Site provides a link to such websites.  You are encouraged to review the policies of any and all such websites carefully, as your rights will be governed by those websites’ respective privacy policies.  Alternatively, there may be unauthorized third-party websites that may link to our Site without our knowledge or control.  Inspire USA (a) is not responsible for the content of any third-party websites, (b) expressly disclaims any statements or assertions made on any third-party websites, and (c) denies all liability associated with your use of, and the content on, any third-party websites.  </p>
           
           <p><strong class="fs16">8. Minors and Children Under Age 13</strong></p>
           <p>We recommend that minors 13 years of age or older ask their parents for permission before sending any Personal Information to anyone over the Internet.</p>
    	   <p>We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register on the Site or send any Personal Information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 may provide any Personal Information to Inspire USA or on the Site. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us.</p>
           
           <p><strong class="fs16">9. Access to information</strong></p>
           <p>Please contact us if you believe that the Personal Information that you have provided to us is not up-to-date, complete or accurate.  You have the right to request the correction of any information which relates to you and is inaccurate.  If you would like us to delete any Personal Information that you have disclosed only to us as part of registering or subscribing with the Site, please let us know and we will take reasonable steps to delete it unless we are required by law to keep it.</p>
           <p>However, if you publicly disclose your Personal Information  on the Site, (e.g., you  include Personal Information in a comment to an article on the Site or in an User Submission), such information becomes public information.  We may not be able to remove such publicly disclosed Personal Information.  Please be aware of this before you choose to publicly disclose your Personal Information on the Site.</p>
