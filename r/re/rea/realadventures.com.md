### **What are my choices regarding collection, use and distribution of my information?**

RealAdventures uses cookies to help us better understand how our site is accessed and utilized. The cookies do not contain any personal information about you. We place the date, time and a unique identifier in the cookie that we create and place on your hard drive. If you prefer not to have these cookies installed on your hard drive, you may be able to change the cookie settings of your browser. Most browsers provide users with options to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you decide to reject all cookies, you will still be able to use the RealAdventures site. But, by doing so, we will not be able to present you with a personalized version of our site that reflects your style, preferences and tastes.

**Visitors:** If you sign up to receive promotional e-mail, you will be providing us with some personal information to help us tailor e-mail messages to your interests and needs. Your information wil only be shared with afiliates and advertisers if you explicitly authorize RealAdventures to do so. Even then, strict confidentiality and privacy agreements will always apply. Typically, only your e-mail address will be shared. You can change your personal information at any time.

**Listing Partners:** If you add your listing to the RealAdventures website, you are doing so with the understanding that the information will be available through our search engines to all visitors. In addition, if you authorize us, we may share some of your listing information with other advertisers. You can change this authorization at any time.

### **How can I update, correct or delete my personal information?**

**Visitors:** If you have signed up to receive promotional e-mails, you may update your personal information at any time. At this time you can not delete your record.

**Listing Partners:** You can update your information at any time. Changes made to the listing information will be reflected immediately when a visitor displays or searches for your listing. At this time you cannot delete a listing, but you can make it inactive. Making a listing inactive means that visitors will not be able to search for or view it. You will still have the ability to update and reactivate the listing at any time.

### **What security precautions are used to prevent unauthorized access or updates to my information?**

All information collected for promotional e-mail or listing information is assigned a unique number along with a user specified password. Only you and the RealAdventures staff have access to this information. We recommend using a 'complex' password that is difficult to guess. Complex password include a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and/ or punctuation (Examples: Apple.Sauce, Telephone.Antenna, USA34John). If the correct password is not entered within three attempts, that record will be locked until RealAdventures is connected with identifying information.

Do not reveal your account number, listing number or password to anyone. This will ensure that others will not be able to access or update your information.

While most companies and individuals access the Internet for legitimate personal and business reasons, there are some who seek to gain access to or corrupt private information. They may attempt to do this by intercepting data transmissions or hacking at your password. We cannot prevent security breaches of this nature. But we will make every effort to ensure data privacy, security and integrity once we receive it.

### **What else should I know about my privacy?**

Any personal information that you reveal while surfing the Internet (through on-line forms, message boards, chat rooms, e-mail messages, etc) can potentially be collected and used by others. As a result, you may receive unsolicited e-mail messages or phone calls.

Protection of personal or professional information, e-mail addresses and passwords is ultimately your responsibility.
