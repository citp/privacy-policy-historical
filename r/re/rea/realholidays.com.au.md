**Cookies**

Cookies are data that a website transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies, which are industry standard and are used by most websites, including our websites, can facilitate a user's ongoing access to and use of a site. They allow us to customise our websites to your needs. 

All pages on our websites are coded with measurement software which is transparent to the user. The software makes use of an invisible image at the bottom of the web page. This software stores a "cookie" in the browser, which contains a unique string. This enables them to count the number of unique browsers to our websites. This information is collected and aggregated, and in no way does this unique identifier identify a user personally. We do not and will not marry any data collected with any personal information collected on our websites. We use the independent companies, including [Nielsen/NetRatings](http://www.nielsen-online.com/) and [Omniture](http://www.omniture.com/) to measure and analyse the Internet usage across our websites. 

If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the cookie feature. However, you should note that cookies may be necessary to provide you with some features of our online services.

**Links to Other Sites**

We provide links to websites outside of our websites, as well as to third party websites. These linked sites are not under our control, and we cannot accept responsibility for the conduct of companies linked to our websites. Before disclosing your personal information on any other website, we advise you to examine the terms and conditions of using that website and its privacy statement.

**Credit applications by real estate agents**

If you apply to us for credit, we will ask you to authorise us to obtain personal information about you from credit reporting agencies, other credit providers, existing or previous suppliers of goods or services, your bank and certain other businesses for the purposes of assessing your application. 

We will also require you to authorise us to disclose your personal information to:

  * credit reporting agencies (for the purpose of obtaining a credit report); and 
  * other credit providers, existing or previous suppliers of goods or services, your bank and certain other businesses (for the purposes of assessing your application). 



In addition to the ways in which we may use personal information set out above, if you are a customer of REA, we may also use your personal information:

  * to help carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us; 
  * to assess your application, where you have applied to us for credit; and 
  * by disclosing the information to debt collection agencies to recover any amounts you owe us.
