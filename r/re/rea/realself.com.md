# Privacy Policy ~ Guidelines & Policies

## 1\. Introduction 

RealSelf values your privacy. This Privacy Policy details important information about the collection, use, disclosure, storage and protection of your personal information. This Privacy Policy applies to realself.com ("Site") as well as to any RealSelf mobile application ("App") (whether accessed by a tablet, mobile phone or other similar device) or any RealSelf service ("Service"). RealSelf provides this notice about our practices to help you make an informed decision about whether to use or continue using the Site, RealSelf App or Service.

**By registering for an account with RealSelf or accessing the RealSelf Site, RealSelf App or Service, you are accepting the terms of this Privacy Policy and you are consenting to the collection, use, disclosure and storage of your personal information in accordance with the practices described in this policy.**

**Please note that any content posted by you onto the Site (whether or not through any RealSelf App) becomes published content and is publicly available for anyone in the world to view and, as such, is not considered personal information subject to this Privacy Policy. RealSelf will display this content on the Site and may distribute it through other third party sites and services.**

## 2\. Information RealSelf Collects

**Information RealSelf Receives from You.** RealSelf receives and stores any information you enter on the Site. This information may include information that can identify you ("personal information") including your first and last name, geographic location, email address as well as user name and password. You can choose not to provide RealSelf with any information but in order to be a registered member of RealSelf or view some of the content available on the Site, you must provide RealSelf with your email address, user name and password. Registered community members of RealSelf are able to upload comments, questions, reviews and send messages to other community members. Registered health care providers are able to upload information about their practice as well as respond to questions on the Site. You may also provide RealSelf with personal information in order to participate in various activities on the Site such as entering contests or sweepstakes, taking advantage of promotions, responding to surveys, subscribing to newsletters or other mailing lists or completing a form related to one of our products or services.

In addition, if you provide your third-party account information to RealSelf (e.g., your log-in information for Facebook or other third party social networking sites), you understand that RealSelf may receive information about you (including information about friends, connections, contact information and demographic information) from those third party sites and that information may be transmitted into your RealSelf account. The information collected by RealSelf from the third party sites may depend on your privacy settings with those third party sites. As a result, you should consult the privacy notices or policies of those third party sites.

If you send direct messages or electronic messages through RealSelf to other RealSelf users or health care providers, please note that RealSelf may store these messages in order to deliver them and allow you or the recipient of the message to manage them. In addition, if you send messages to RealSelf using our "Live Chat" feature, then you understand that RealSelf will store these messages in order to verify the accuracy of the information you submitted as well as for staff training purposes. RealSelf may disclose any of your messages as part of investigations into the use and operation of the Site. RealSelf may also choose not to deliver your messages if the messages are spam or are otherwise objectionable in the sole discretion of RealSelf.  


**Information RealSelf Automatically Collects Through Your Use of the Site or Service.**

**Cookies Information.** When you visit the RealSelf Site, we (and third parties with whom we partner) may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. RealSelf uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the RealSelf Site may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. The cookies may transmit information about you and your use of the Site such as your browser type, IP address, advertisement data and the date and time of your use of the Site.

RealSelf uses cookies to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Site or App (e.g., if you are a registered member of the Site, then RealSelf may use cookies to recognize your registration information so that you do not need to log into the Site during your next visit to the Site); (b) provide custom, personalized content and information (including customized advertising); monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests.

**Log File Information.** When you use the Site, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser language, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. RealSelf collects this information in order to improve the Site. 

**Web Beacons.** When you use the Site, we may employ Web Beacons or "clear gifs" which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously (i.e., in a non-personally-identifiable manner). In addition, we may also use Web Beacons in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. RealSelf uses Web Beacons in order to measure the effectiveness of its offerings and content.

**Location Information and Device Information.** If you are accessing the Site or App from a mobile device or tablet, RealSelf may be able to collect your location information if this feature is enabled on your mobile device or tablet. In addition, if you are accessing the Site from your computer, then RealSelf may be able to collect your general location information from your IP address. RealSelf may use this information to provide you with a personalized user experience by showing you content relevant for your geographic location. If you are accessing the App through a mobile device and you do not want to share your location information with RealSelf, then you may be able to turn off this feature on your mobile device.

**How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals.**

RealSelf currently does not respond to "Do Not Track" signals.

**Payment Information**.  If you purchase a RealDeal through realself.com, the payment information that you provide to RealSelf is transmitted via an encrypted connection to our Third-Party Payment Processor, Stripe. Stripe uses, processes and stores your personal and payment information in accordance with Stripe’s [Privacy Policy](http://stripe.com/us/privacy) available at [stripe.com/us/privacy](https://stripe.com/us/privacy). RealSelf does not store your payment information.  However, RealSelf does collect your name, email address and telephone number in order to process your payment and this information is stored by RealSelf.  Stripe maintains that it is PCI compliant and you can learn more about Stripe’s security measures available at[ stripe.com/help/security](https://stripe.com/help/security).  By submitting your credit or debit information to RealSelf, you expressly consent to RealSelf sharing your personal and payment information with Stripe and acknowledge and agree that Stripe may store your credit card or debit card information in connection with your purchase of a RealDeal.  


## 3\. How RealSelf Uses Information

**Use of Voluntary Disclosure of Information.** Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose on the RealSelf Site (e.g., on the RealSelf Site discussion boards, in messages and comment areas, within your public profile page, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others.

Your username (not your email address) is displayed to other RealSelf community members and health care providers when you submit any content or send direct messages through the Site. You understand that other RealSelf community members may contact you through messages and comments.

Any content that you submit to the RealSelf Site may be redistributed through the internet and other media channels, and may be viewed by the general public.

**Contact its Users.** We do not use your email address or other personal information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program, feature or service for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major Site changes, updates to this Privacy Policy, the Terms of Service, Code of Conduct or for other customer service purposes).

**Improve the RealSelf Site and Service.** We use both your personal information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymized aggregated usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the Site, the App and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing RealSelf users’ preferences and trends.

## 4\. When RealSelf Discloses Information

**Third-party Vendors.** We provide personal information and non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf, including, but not limited to, providing analytics, A/B testing, marketing, distribution of surveys or sweepstakes programs. We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy and for the sole purpose of providing the specific service to RealSelf. The third-party vendors are not permitted to share the information or use it for any other purpose.

We do not share your personal information (such as name or email address) with other third-party companies for their commercial or marketing use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out.

We do share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous aggregated usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the Site or App.

If you submit your name, email address, telephone number, treatment desired and questions or comments through a form on a specific health care provider’s profile page, then RealSelf will disclose this information to the health care provider identified on the form. In addition, if you submit your mobile phone number through this form, then you understand and consent to RealSelf and/or the health care provider sending you text messages. You understand that standard text messaging fees and data rates may apply. The information you provide through this form is not used by RealSelf for any other purpose.

**Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites.** RealSelf may allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Site or App. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Site. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens.

These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. RealSelf does not provide any personal information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out.

However, please note that if an advertiser asks RealSelf to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, women ages 35-49) or audience segment (for example, women ages 35-49 who have viewed certain content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.

You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks. This privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.

RealSelf does not have any relationships with third-party ad servers or ad networks. If this changes, RealSelf will update this section of the Privacy Policy to identify the third-party ad server or ad network and your choices related to the third-party ad server or ad network.

**Legal Requests and Comply with State and Federal Laws.** We may release personal information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws or to respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant.

RealSelf also reserves the right to disclose personal information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that RealSelf believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Service, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of the Site or App, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of RealSelf, our users or others.

**In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy.** In the event that RealSelf or the Site are acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from our users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal or non-personal information is treated, transferred, or used.

## 5\. Your Choices

You may, of course, decline to submit personal information through the Site or App, in which case RealSelf may not be able to provide certain services to you.

You may update or correct your personal profile information and email preferences at any time by visiting your account profile page. You may also close your account by emailing Community Support [here](https://help.realself.com/customer/portal/emails/new). RealSelf will disassociate your content from your account but please note that content submitted by RealSelf users to the Site (including, but not limited to, reviews, comments, questions and responses to questions) may not be removed and the content remains subject to our Terms of Service. In addition, RealSelf will continue to retain certain information about you in accordance with the privacy practices in this policy.

To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.

Please be aware that if you include personal information as your username or in a review, comment, question or any other content publicly available for anyone to view on the Site, then other users (including health care providers) may be able to identify you from this information. Also, any messages that you send to other users through the Service may not be private or confidential if either you or the recipient of the message discloses it to another person.

Please contact RealSelf with any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, your personal information, your consent, or your opt-in or opt-out choices using the [feedback form](https://help.realself.com/customer/portal/emails/new).

## 6\. Our Commitment to Data Security

RealSelf uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to RealSelf, the Site or the App and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your information, RealSelf makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

If RealSelf learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. RealSelf may post a notice on the Site if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us using our [feedback form](https://help.realself.com/customer/portal/emails/new).

## 7\. Children’s Privacy

Protecting the privacy of children is especially important to RealSelf. For that reason, RealSelf does not knowingly collect or maintain personal information or non-personally-identifiable information from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of the Site, App or Service is directed to persons under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access the Site, App or Service at any time or in any manner.

If RealSelf learns that personal information of persons under 13 years of age has been collected without verified parental consent, then RealSelf will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.

## 8\. Visiting RealSelf.com from outside the United States

The Site, App and Service are hosted in the United States. If you are accessing the Site, App or Service from outside the United States, please be advised that the information you provide RealSelf may be transferred to, processed and stored in the United States where the RealSelf servers are located and our central database is operated. You acknowledge and understand that the data protection and other laws of the United States might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. Through your continued use of the Site, App or Service (which are governed by U.S. law, this Privacy Policy, and our Terms of Service), you consent to the transfer of your personal information to the United States.

## 9\. Changes to this Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be revised periodically and this will be reflected by the "effective date" below. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will take effect 30 days after they are posted. If we make any material changes in the way in which your personal information is collected, used or disclosed, then we will notify you through the Site or by email before the changes take effect. If you object to any of the changes, then you can close your account by contacting us as provided in Section 11 below. Please revisit this page to stay aware of any changes.
