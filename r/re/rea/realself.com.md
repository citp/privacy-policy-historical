This Privacy Policy is effective on May 25, 2018 for all users.

RealSelf values your privacy. This Privacy Policy details important information about the collection, use, disclosure, retention and protection of your personal information. RealSelf provides this notice about our practices to help you make an informed decision about whether to use or continue using the Site (as defined below).

**By registering for an account on the Site or accessing the Site, you are accepting the terms of this Privacy Policy and you are consenting to the collection, use, disclosure and retention of your personal information in accordance with the practices described in this policy. This policy may change from time to time (see Changes to this privacy policy). Your continued use of the Site after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the policy periodically for updates.**

RealSelf will display this content on the Site and may distribute it through other third-party sites and services in its sole discretion.**

## **Scope**

This privacy policy applies to realself.com, our RealSelf mobile applications (whether accessed by a tablet, mobile phone or other similar device) and our other websites (collectively, "Site") whether you browse our Site (without registering for an account) or register for an account to use the Site as either a user or health care provider. This privacy policy also applies to information we collect in email, text and other electronic messages between you and us. This privacy policy does not apply to any third party websites, mobile applications or services, or the offline collection of personal information by RealSelf.  

We have created a separate [Cookie Policy](https://www.realself.com/real_self_cookie_policy.html) to detail our use of cookies and tracking technologies. The Cookie Policy forms part of this privacy policy and the Cookie Policy may be updated from time-to-time as specified in this privacy policy.  

## **Information RealSelf Collects**

RealSelf acts as a data controller when it collects personal information from you when you visit our Site or when you register to use the Site or access your account through the Site. For purposes of this privacy policy, “personal information” means any data and information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. RealSelf collects several types of information from you, including:

### **Information RealSelf receives from you:  **

  * You provide us with personal information when you register on the Site. This information may include: first and last name, geographic location, email address username and password. 

  * You may also provide us with your personal information when you voluntarily fill in forms on our Site. For example, you may provide us with your first and last name, telephone number, email address and desired treatment when you fill out a form to be connected to a health care provider. 

  * When you purchase a RealDeal or other paid products or services within the Site, you may provide us with your first and last name, email address and telephone number in order to process your payment. As explained below, we use a third party payment processor to process the payments on our behalf and we never have access to, store or collect your payment card details. 

  * You may also provide us with personal information when you update your account or through your participation in asking health care providers questions on the Site.

  * You may also provide RealSelf with personal information in order to participate in various activities on the Site such as entering giveaways or sweepstakes, taking advantage of promotions, responding to surveys, subscribing to newsletters or other mailing lists or completing a form related to one of our products or services.

  * You may provide personal information through communications or chats with other users on the Site. You understand that other users may contact you through direct messages and comments on the Site. Any messages that you send to other users through the Site may not be private or confidential if either you or the recipient of the message discloses it to another person or chooses to publicly post it. In addition, RealSelf may monitor these messages and not deliver the message if RealSelf, in its sole discretion, believes the messages are spam, fraudulent or otherwise violate the RealSelf Terms of Service or Code of Conduct.

  * You may also provide us with your personal information when you report a problem with our Site.

  * You also provide RealSelf with your information when you use certain features on the Site, such as submitting reviews, comments, questions and other postings on the Site (“User Contributions”). You understand that your User Contributions are published or displayed on public areas of the Site, or transmitted to other users of the Site or third parties. Your username (not your email address) is displayed to other users when you post User Contributions to the Site. If you use your first or last name as part of your username or your username is discoverable on the internet, then you are making this personal information publicly available and understand that other users may view this personal information and may be able to identify you from this personal information. RealSelf cannot control the actions of other users of the Site with respect to your User Contributions.

## **Your Choices**

RealSelf strives to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us, and we understand that you have rights in your personal information such as: the right to access, correct, delete, object to and restrict the use of your personal information. We also understand that you have the right to obtain a copy of your personal information from us and to withdraw your consent of the processing of your personal information by us.

  * You can choose not to provide personal information through our Site, in which case RealSelf may not be able to provide certain services to you or respond to your requests.

  * You can access, review and change your personal information by logging into your account on the Site and visiting your account profile page. You may also send us an email at [privacy@realself.com](mailto:privacy@realself.com) to request access to, correct or delete any personal information that you have provided to us. In some cases, we may not be able to delete your personal information except by also deleting your user account.

However, copies of your User Contributions may remain viewable in cached and archived pages, or might have been copied or stored by other Site users. In addition, RealSelf will continue to retain certain information about you in accordance with the privacy practices in this policy or if required to do so as a result of a legal obligation.

  * If you wish to know what personal information we hold about you, and if you want it to be removed from our systems, please contact us at privacy@realself.com.




In order to fulfill the above requests, RealSelf may ask you to verify your identity before responding to such requests. Further, your right to access your personal information may not apply in some cases, including where providing access is unreasonably burdensome or expensive under the circumstances or where it would violate the rights of someone other than the individual requesting access.

If you do not want us to use information that we collect or that you provide to us to deliver advertisements, for analytics or remarketing services, then you may opt-out as described below.

  * For analytics, we use Google Analytics, which is a web analytics service that tracks and reports website traffic. Google uses the data collected to track and monitor the use of our Site. This data may be shared with other Google services. Google may use the collected data to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network. You can opt-out of having your activity on the Site available to Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. The add-on prevents Google Analytics JavaScript from sharing information with Google Analytics about visits activity. For more information on the privacy practices of Google, please visit Google Privacy & Terms web page at: <https://policies.google.com/privacy>.

  * RealSelf uses Google AdSense & DoubleClick Cookie on the Site. Google, as a service provider, uses cookies to serve ads on our Site. Google’s use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our Site or other websites on the internet. You may opt out of the use of the DoubleClick Cookie for interest-based advertising by visiting the Google Ads settings web page at: <http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/>. You can also opt out of receiving targeted ads from members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) on the NAI’s website.

  * RealSelf currently uses Google AdWords, which is a remarketing service provided by Google. You can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize the Google Display Network ads by visiting the Google Ads settings page at: <http://www.google.com/settings/ads>. In addition, Google also recommends installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on for your web browser, which is available at: <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout>. This tool provides visitors with the ability to prevent their data from being collected and used by Google Analytics. 




## **Our Commitment to Data Security**

RealSelf uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. For example, to protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to the Site and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your information, RealSelf makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of your information. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. 

If RealSelf learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. RealSelf may post a notice on the Site if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us using our [feedback form](https://help.realself.com/customer/portal/emails/new).

## **Children’s Privacy**

Protecting the privacy of children is important to RealSelf. For that reason, RealSelf does not knowingly collect or maintain personal information from persons under 18 years of age, and no part of the Site is directed to persons under 18. If you are under 18 years of age, then please do not use or access the Site at any time or in any manner. If RealSelf learns that personal information of persons under 18 years of age has been collected without verified parental consent, then RealSelf will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.

## **Visiting RealSelf.com from outside the United States**

The Site is hosted in the United States. If you are accessing the Site from outside the United States, please be advised that the information you provide RealSelf may be transferred to, processed and stored in the United States where the RealSelf servers are located and our central database is operated. You acknowledge and understand that the data protection and other laws of the United States might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. Through your continued use of the Site (which is governed by U.S. law, this privacy policy, and our Terms of Service), you consent to the transfer of your personal information to the United States.

## **Retention of Personal Information**

RealSelf will retain your personal information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set forth in the privacy policy. RealSelf will retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your personal information to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies. 

## **Important Information**

### **California Privacy Rights for California Residents.**

California residents may request certain information regarding the disclosure of your personal information by RealSelf to third parties for direct marketing purposes.

RealSelf retains the recordings for a reasonable period of time in order to fulfill the purpose for which the telephone calls were recorded and then the recordings are deleted.

### **How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals**

RealSelf currently does not respond to "Do Not Track" signals because there is not an industry or legal standard for such signals.

### **Automated Decision-Making**

RealSelf does not use any personal information provided by you for the purposes of automated decision-making.

### **Links to Other Sites**

Our Site may contain links to other websites that are not operated by RealSelf. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third-party’s website.
