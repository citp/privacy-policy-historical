Your e-mail address or telephone number may be used by authorized LendingTree employees to contact you concerning your application. 
  3. **How your information is used.**
    * **Sharing information with our participating Lenders and real estate professionals.** After up to four participating Lenders and/or real estate professionals receive your information, they may contact you directly via phone, e-mail or other communications. All of our Lenders and real estate agents operate under federal and/or state laws and regulations and believe, as we do, that the Internet is an exciting and secure place to do business. If you are matched with any participating Lenders, the Lender with which you choose to close your loan and/or obtain your credit card will report certain information about your loan and/or credit card to LendingTree, and LendingTree will treat that information in the manner it treats the information you provided on your loan or realty request. As our Lenders and real estate professionals may keep and use your information whether or not you qualify for a transaction with them, we recommend that you contact them directly for more information about their specific privacy policies. 
    * **Sharing information with third parties.** Following is an example of how LendingTree may act as an agent for our participating Lenders and real estate professionals. A Lender may instruct us to share information with an appraiser to prepare an appraisal of the property to be mortgaged, with a flood certification provider to determine whether the property lies in a flood plain, or with a prospective secondary market purchaser of the mortgage loan the lender may make. In such situations, we will be acting on behalf of the Lender, under the authority of the Lender's privacy policy, a copy of which you will receive from the Lender. All of the information-sharing we do as agent for the Lender would be permissible under applicable federal law for the Lender to do directly.

From time to time, LendingTree may notify you about a special offer from one of our promotional partners. At your request, LendingTree will not send you any information or offers unrelated to your request for financing. If you do not wish to receive any of these offers, please visit our subscription area where you can remove yourself from our mailing list. 

  4. **Altering Information You Submit Through a LendingTree Web Site.**
    * **Changing your information.** If you want to change the type of loan or make other significant changes to your loan or realty request, you might need to make another request through our Web site. If you wish to change your subscriptions to LendingTree emails, you can visit our subscription page. 
    * **Deleting your information.** Even if your loan or realty request was withdrawn, by law, we cannot delete that information. We store all of the information you might provide securely. You can visit our Security section to learn more about how we do this. 
  5. **How Our Policy is Monitored.**

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact our Customer Care Department. If we make a change to our Privacy Policy in the future that will affect how we treat your information, we will notify you of the change. In that case, your ability to opt out of the new policy will be determined by applicable laws and we will include that information in our notification. If the change impacts how we use your information, we will notify you even if you have requested that we not contact you.
