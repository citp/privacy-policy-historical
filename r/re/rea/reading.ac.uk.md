### What information will we collect about you?

We will collect information about you if you place an order with us for a product, such as a prospectus, or for a service, such as a conference.

### How we will use the information 

Where personal information is collected on the University of Reading's website, for instance through a web form or an online payment system, users will be informed as to what information is being captured, why and who (if anyone) it will be shared with. 

The University will not sell, license or trade your personal information without your consent. We will not share your personal information with others unless they are acting under our instructions or we are required to do so by law.

Information collected via the University's server logs includes users' IP addresses and the web pages visited; this will be used to manage the web system and troubleshoot problems. 

The University also uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google") to understand how visitors engage with our website and so we can improve it. See the section on **_Google Analytics_ **below.
