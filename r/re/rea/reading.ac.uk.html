<h3 id="collect">What information will we collect about you?</h3>
<p>We will collect information about you if you place an order with us for a product, such as a prospectus, or for a service, such as a conference. </p>
<p>We will also collect personal information about website usage through cookies (see the section on <strong><a href="#cookies"><u>Cookies, Google Analytics and third party cookies</u></a></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>below) and server logs, which track the IP addresses of users visiting our site and the pages they visit. 
</p><h3 id="use">How we will use the information </h3>
<p>Where personal information is collected on the University of Reading's website, for instance through a web form or an online payment system, users will be informed as to what information is being captured, why and who (if anyone) it will be shared with. </p>
<p>The University will not sell, license or trade your personal information without your consent. We will not share your personal information with others unless they are acting under our instructions or we are required to do so by law.</p>
<p>Information collected via the University's server logs includes users' IP addresses and the web pages visited; this will be used to manage the web system and troubleshoot problems. </p>
<p>The University also uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google") to understand how visitors engage with our website and so we can improve it. See the section on <strong><a href="#GoogleAnalytics"><u>Google Analytics</u></a>&nbsp;</strong>below.</p>
<h3 id="cookies">Cookies, Google Analytics and third party cookies </h3>
<p>Cookies are text files placed on your computer to help us analyse how users use our site.&nbsp;A cookie is a small data file able to track the online movements of an individual. This information could potentially be used to build an online profile of individuals and uniquely locate them in the world. </p>

<h4 id="cookies1">Cookies</h4>
<p>Our website uses session cookies to ensure that you have a good experience. These cookies contain a unique number, your 'session ID', which allows our server to recognise your computer and 'remember' what you've done on the site. The benefits of this are:</p>
<ul>
<li>You only need to log in once if you're navigating secure areas of the site 
</li><li>You are able to use interactive elements of the site, such as forms 
</li><li>Our server can distinguish between your computer and other users, so you can see the information that you have requested.</li></ul>
<p>When you close your browser the cookie will be deleted and the site will 'forget'.</p>
