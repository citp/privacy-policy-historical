# Realeyes - Privacy

Realeyes OÜ (ROÜ) conducts market research on behalf of businesses, governments and other third-party organizations. Our proprietary software is used to track participants' facial features and to analyze their emotional response to on-screen media. When you consent to participate in an ROÜ study, two types of data may be collected:

  * **Text-based survey responses**
  * **Video-based facial recordings**



While ROÜ is committed to making the participant experience as natural and as unobtrusive as possible, we also take our data collection responsibilities very seriously.

Safeguarding your privacy is of the utmost importance.

## 1

ROÜ has a strict opt-in research policy. We only collect study data (including facial recordings) from participants who have given their explicit consent by clicking the "Allow" button prior to each media viewing session.

## 2

Any personally identifiable information (see definition below) that you may provide will be treated as strictly confidential and will not be disclosed by ROÜ.

## 3

Any study data (including facial recordings) that you provide will be aggregated together with the data sets of other participants during the reporting process. Our goal is to measure the overall, cumulative emotional response to on-screen media. ROÜ reporting is quantitative rather than qualitative, and does not focus on the study data of any one specific participant. Individual results are never presented.

## Data Security

All study data will be stored in a secure location in accordance with our Privacy Policy. Furthermore, ROÜ will never sell, share and/or transfer any personally identifiable information to our clients or any other third-party organizations.

## Your Data

ROÜ specialises in market research. Your participation in our studies is highly valued. We are interested in your opinions and your reactions to on-screen media. We will never try to sell you any products or services and we will never share your contact information with any firms engaged in marketing, telemarketing or other solicitous activities.

## Child Protection

ROÜ does not knowingly obtain information, study data, or survey responses from participants under the age of 18, unless there is consent from a parent or legal guardian. Should we discover that any data has been collected from a participant under the age of 18, without consent of a parent or legal guardian, we will immediately discard it.

## Sale of company

Should ROÜ be acquired, we reserve the right to transfer all study data and affiliated study information to any lawful purchaser of ROÜ. We also reserve the right to share study data to satisfy laws, government authorities, legal processes, court orders, regulations, subpoenas, and applicable law enforcement efforts.

## Consent for personally identifiable information

As stated above, ROÜ does not sell or share personally identifiable information. In the vast majority of ROÜ studies we do NOT request any personally identifiable information from participants. However, there may be times when ROÜ engages in research where the transfer of personally identifiable information is required. In such instances, ROÜ will obtain a separate consent from each participant and will state exactly why we are collecting the data, and what it will be used for. Our objective is to ensure maximum transparency regarding the management of confidential and/or personal information.

## Personally Identifiable Information

Personally identifiable information includes names, physical addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, social network identities, credit/debit card numbers and any other person-specific contact information. If we receive any personally identifiable information, we will deal with that information in accordance with our Privacy Policy.

Notwithstanding the Privacy Policy, ROÜ retains the right to use anonymized study data to assess quality assurance and to improve software and reporting capabilities.

If you do not agree with our Privacy Policy, please do not participate in ROÜ market research studies at this time.
