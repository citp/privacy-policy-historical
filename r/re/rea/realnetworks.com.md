INDEX TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY  
  
  
REALNETWORKS PRIVACY PRINCIPLES  
RealNetworks does not share with third parties any personal information you provide in connection with our products, without first obtaining your informed consent.  
Third parties, who may have access to personal information, include contractors or service vendors performing work on behalf of RealNetworks and are contractually subject to RealNetworks privacy policies and confidentiality agreements. In the event that court orders or laws mandate RealNetworks to disclose personal information, RealNetworks will release the personal information as required by law.  


RealNetworks maintains controls to provide security over personal information, including credit card details, during and after the purchase process.  
The controls include:  
|  |   
---|---  
| The use of secure connections from the customer's Web browser to RealNetworks.  
|   
| The use of encryption for sensitive personal information, such as credit card numbers and user names.  
|   
| The logical security of the databases that store customers' credit card numbers.  
|   
| Security controls to restrict access to databases housing personally identifiable information.  
|   
| Requirements that employees, contractors, and service vendors acting as agents of RealNetworks sign an agreement noting that they have read, understand, and will adhere to RealNetworks confidentiality policies.  
|   
| Quality assurance procedures during product development requiring that new and upgraded products be specifically tested to ensure that they do not contradict or violate RealNetworks Privacy Policy.  
  
RealNetworks sends you e-mail regarding products and services only if you have indicated you wish to receive e-mail from us. You may remove yourself from our e-mailing list at any time.  
RealNetworks only sends e-mail to customers regarding RealNetworks products and other promotions, RealNetworks support, and RealNetworks services if the customer wishes to receive these e-mails. The customer has the ability to opt-out of these communications during the registration process, through the removal option posted throughout RealNetworks Web sites and by visiting the RealNetworks My Account area.

RealNetworks does not create individual user profiles based on the specific content that is played through our products.  
RealNetworks does not create individual user profiles based on the specific content, such as the songs and videos played via RealPlayer and RealJukebox. We use cookies to verify your access rights to premium content and to enable our product features. This Privacy Policy explains our current use of cookies with respect to user profiles. RealNetworks retains aggregated log files of requested content in order to report overall product usage to premium content partners and we may use player usage data to build aggregated, anonymous data profiles. It is RealNetworks policy to undergo, on a periodic basis, independent third party audits of our privacy practices to ensure compliance with this assertion.

RealNetworks responds to your privacy questions.  
You may contact us at <http://forms.real.com/service/contact/privacy.html>.

RealNetworks is constantly innovating and implementing new features in its products to provide the best possible user experience. Because our software, services and web properties are constantly changing and improving, this policy will continue to evolve as our software evolves. We want to make sure you have the most up-to-date information when we release new products and revise existing products.

SCOPE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY  
RealNetworks owns and maintains a variety of Web sites, including, but not limited to Real.com, Realguide.com, RealNetworks.com, Realstore.com, LiveConcerts.com, Film.com and WebActive.com. Some RealNetworks web services accessed through RealNetworks Products, such as RealOne Player, also qualify as web properties. Each of these sites may have their own mailing lists or other methods of contacting customers. All of the sites, with the exception of WebActive.com, follow this privacy policy for collecting information or sharing personally identifiable information with third parties.

RealNetworks will use reasonable efforts to comply with this privacy policy and will take prompt corrective action when it learns of any failure to comply with our privacy policy. We customarily release alpha and beta versions of our products, which are further refined before the release of the final "Gold" version. Because these products are still in a test phase, we may not always catch an unintended privacy issue, despite our efforts to do so. As such, we welcome user feedback on any privacy concerns you may have, and on how to improve our products generally, in all stages of release. In light of the above and because of the complex and constantly changing nature of our technology and business, RealNetworks does not guarantee error-free performance under this privacy policy. RealNetworks shall not be liable for any incidental, consequential or punitive damages relating to this privacy policy. This Privacy Policy shall be governed by the laws of the United States.

Cookies  
What is a cookie?  
A “cookie” is a small element of data that a web site like Real.com can store on your system. It can be used to provide you with a tailored user experience. RealNetworks uses two types of cookies: browser cookies, which are sent to your Internet browser, and RealPlayer cookies, which are sent to the version of RealPlayer you are currently using. Both types of cookies store these small pieces of data on your machine so we may tailor your experience using our products and visiting our web sites.

How does RealNetworks use cookies?  
Like many web and e-commerce sites, RealNetworks uses cookies to “recognize” your Internet browsing and RealPlayer software in order to display information that is relevant to you and to cache some elements of our web sites and services to improve their performance. When you visit our web sites and use our products and services, RealNetworks cookies are sent to our servers.

Primarily, we use cookies to better personalize the specific pages, content, banners, and promotions that you will see when you visit RealNetworks web sites and use RealNetworks products and services. For example, we are able to deliver radio stations to your RealOne Player based on zip code information you provide to us.

We also use cookies to understand traffic patterns on RealNetworks web sites so that we can enhance your experience and provide you with more relevant information about our products and the content available on our web sites.

In addition, we use cookies to authorize access to certain premium or trial content, programming, services or software features. Information is stored in a browser cookie so you can access so that you can access premium Web pages and in a RealPlayer cookie so that you can play premium audio and video.

We treat any personally identifiable information that may be contained in cookies with the same confidentiality as when you purchase something on one of our web sites.

What information does RealNetworks put into user cookies?  
When you download or purchase a product from us, create a user account, sign-in to our products and services or visit RealNetworks web sites we may set both browser and RealPlayer cookies on your personal computer. These cookies may contain values for:  
|   
---|---  
| Cookie version  
|   
| User name (your encrypted e-mail address)  
|   
| User ID (your numeric representation in the RealNetworks database)  
|   
| Your encrypted name  
|   
| Your location information, including zip or postal code, what country you are in and your preferred language  
|   
| Information about the product you are using, including the products name, type, version and build number  
|   
| Each RealNetworks premium service you have purchased, your current service status, the premium features the service entitles you to and the service expiration date. This may also include your current available RealOne Music download and stream count  
|   
| Your RealNetworks content preferences  
|   
| Your age and gender  
|   
| Your connection speed  
|   
| Information on radio stations you have recently played  
|   
| Information on your local radio stations  
|   
| When the cookie was last updated  
|   
| When the cookie is set to expire  
  
Information that we store about you in cookies (such as user name and zip code) is a reflection of information that you have provided us during product download, purchase, registration and installation (please see What Information We Collect During Product Downloads, Purchases and Installation). You can view and edit this information by visiting the My Account area on Real.com. Editing this data will update information stored in your cookies.

This cookie data is read by RealNetworks for the purposes stated above and is not read by third parties.

You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a browser cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. You may also change your RealPlayer cookie settings through preferences options in our products (please see RealNetworks Products below for more information).

RealNetworks does not require that you accept cookies, however, some functionality on our web sites, our product purchase check-out process, and products and services may be impaired if you decline to accept cookies.

Retention of Cookies.  
RealNetworks will retain cookies that are set on our web sites, products and services for the stated purpose of the applicable content or function. For example, a cookie set to identify a user who customizes content for RealGuide will be retained as long as the user indicates he or she wishes to access such customized content. Cookies that are set as part of subscription services will be active for the duration of the subscription. In other cases, RealNetworks will retain a cookie to maximize the functionality of serving pages and content from our web sites, consistent with our privacy principles.

If you are concerned about how RealNetworks cookies may interact with third-party advertising services, please Third Party Relationships, below, for more information.

General Information about Managing Cookies:  
A number of privacy organizations publish guides on how to manage or disable web based cookies. Some of these specific pages are linked here:

IP Address  
What is an IP address?  
Your computer uses IP addresses every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer so that data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to you. Our Web servers automatically collect IP addresses. From time to time, RealNetworks may use information derived from your IP address to deliver you appropriate products, services and software and to prevent fraud. For example, RealNetworks may block the ability to purchase specific RealOne services if we detect an international IP address and we are prohibited from selling that specific service outside of the United States.

Referring URLs aka "Referrers"  
What is a Referrer?  
A "Referrer" is the information passed along by a web browser that references the Web URL you linked from to visit our web sites. It is automatically collected by our Web servers. This information is collected and used by RealNetworks to understand the web sites referring traffic to our download and order pages and to present appropriate content to our potential customers. Referrer information is tabulated by RealNetworks on an aggregated basis to identify general trends and traffic patterns.

From time to time, RealNetworks may enter into agreements with content partners that require RealNetworks to count the number of product downloads and/or product sales stemming from a referral from a content partner site. This information is collected, used and aggregated by RealNetworks to fulfill the reporting requirements of those agreements. This information may also be combined with the referrer information described above and tabulated on an aggregated basis to identify general trends and traffic patterns. At the time of product download and/or purchase, information you provide to RealNetworks, including personal information and referring URL's, is collected in our web server logs and customer database and is kept strictly confidential and not shared with third parties.

System Information  
What is system information?  
System information we collect includes, but may not be limited to:  
|   
---|---  
| Time of transaction  
|   
| The type of Web browser you are using  
|   
| The operating system/platform you are using  
|   
| Connection speed  
|   
| CPU speed  
  
This information may be sent automatically when your application requests additional information from RealNetworks servers, such as after an error message, and is primarily used by RealNetworks for broad demographic statistics. It is also used to help resolve technical support requests and to provide you with a custom product experience.

RealNetworks may also collect the URL of a server that you are having problems with to improve the traffic flow to and from those servers. RealNetworks aggregates the URL data and does not associate this web traffic data with any personal information.

Security Identification Number  
The latest version of RealPlayer, “RealOne Player,” generates a unique security identification number using information from your hard drive serial number. This Security ID is used by RealNetworks to verify user access rights to premium RealOne member benefits and to prevent fraud, piracy and unauthorized access to premium features, content and services. It is generated and sent to RealNetworks on installation and sign-in of RealOne Player for premium users.

Unique Identifiers (GUIDs)  
RealNetworks Use of GUIDS in RealOne Player  
The RealOne Player has GUIDs turned off in its default setting.  


What is a GUID?  
A Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) is an alphanumeric identifier used to indicate a unique installation of a product, and is found in many popular software applications such as web browsers and media players. RealNetworks and third party content providers may use GUIDs for aggregate statistical analysis, to authenticate premium content and to personalize products and services.

RealNetworks Use of GUIDS in other products and in future products  
Some RealNetworks products, including some versions of RealPlayer 8, randomly generate a GUID during installation. RealNetworks uses publicly documented standards to generate GUIDs. From time to time, RealNetworks may use a GUID with a unique set of numbers in order to gather and aggregate information about traffic patterns, such as how many times a unique RealPlayer attempts to access content from a server. These statistics help us improve performance and reduce network congestion, providing our users with faster and more reliable access to a wide variety of content.

We may collect data marked by RealPlayer GUIDs in order to understand aggregated traffic patterns and other RealPlayer usage patterns. We use this data in order to measure product performance, better understand types of content that are popular with our users and how our products are used, protect against system failure, analyze how our products interoperate with portable devices and cd burners, and to conduct user surveys. We do not relate GUID marked traffic data to other personal information supplied by users, unless we obtain user consent to do so. Further, consistent with our privacy principles, RealNetworks does not sell or share such information with any third party unless we obtain a user’s advance informed consent.

How to Disable Transmission of the RealPlayer GUID  
To disable transmission of GUIDs, please see the GUID information sections for RealOne Player and RealPlayer 8 under RealNetworks Products.

For more information about enabling or disabling GUIDs with streaming media servers, please go to [http://www.real.com/products/player/](http://www.real.com/products/player/g2/rsdata.html#guid)  
[g2/rsdata.html#guid](http://www.real.com/products/player/g2/rsdata.html#guid)

Zip Code Information  
Upon product registration, RealNetworks account creation, and product installation, we may ask users to supply us with the zip code where their RealPlayer is used. The ZipCode is used by RealNetworks to improve traffic routing and reduce networks congestion by finding servers that are located closer to your ZipCode address.

RealNetworks may also use the ZipCode to offer content programming, services, advertising, instructions that are most appropriate for your language and region.

WHAT WE DO WITH INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND USE  
As described above in our Privacy Principles, RealNetworks restricts use of personally identifiable information provided by you. Personally identifiable information provided to RealNetworks is used:  
|  |   
---|---  
| To verify access rights to premium content (such as SuperPass or RealOne Music) or other access-restricted services and software  
|   
| To provide you with information or to ask you to participate in surveys about products, services, news and events  
|   
| To allow you to purchase and download products and games  
|   
| To provide you with advertising, promotions and special offers we feel you may be interested in  
|   
| To inform you of new products and upgrades with your consent  
|   
| To provide you with personalized content programming and services (such as local radio stations or recently played radio stations)  
|   
| To provide you with content, services and instructions based on your language preferences, zip/postal code and country locations  
|   
| To determine if you meet the minimum system requirements for our products  
|   
| To better understand on an aggregated basis how our products are used, traffic patterns and what types of content are most popular with users of our products and services  
|   
| For aggregate statistical analysis, such as keeping track of the number of unique downloads.  
  
RealNetworks uses RealPlayer and browser cookies to accomplish the personalization and premium content rights management described above. These cookies are read only by RealNetworks and are transmitted from web browsers and the RealPlayer client to servers maintained by RealNetworks. RealNetworks does not create individual user profiles based on specific content accessed via our products (See our Privacy Principles, above.) Users may disable cookies (see Real Networks Products, below); however, disabling cookies has the following effect: (1) you may be required to sign-in with your user name and password every time you wish to access premium content, services, and features; (2) some product features, which require cookies to function, may be disabled.

RealNetworks retains the services of certain outside contractors to perform services on our behalf (for example, to ship products that are purchased from our Web site, to help provide technical support services or to provide technology necessary to enable RealNetworks products and services). At times, we must disclose relevant information about our customers to our contractors so they may provide specific services for RealNetworks. RealNetworks requires such contractors to keep your information strictly confidential and to use the information solely on behalf of RealNetworks. For purposes of this Privacy Statement, such contractors are not considered "third parties" and RealNetworks may disclose personally identifiable information to such contractors without additional notice.

In addition, the RealNetworks Web sites and products contain links to other Web sites and products. However, RealNetworks is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites or products. Please visit the privacy policies of these third party sites in order to understand their privacy and data collection practices.

RealNetworks e-mail

You may always opt-out of receiving such contacts by clicking on the link provided at the bottom of our e-mail to you.

Once you supply us with personal information, such as an e-mail address, RealNetworks does not change the manner of usage of such information from its original purpose, unless we first obtain your informed consent.

HTML e-mail  
HTML e-mail is visually rich e-mail that helps us provide you with pictures and graphics describing products and services.

RealNetworks follows these privacy principles when sending HTML e-mails:  
|  |   
---|---  
| We do not collect or track whether an individual recipient can render the HTML portion of the e-mail.  
|   
| We do not collect or track whether an e-mail was read by an individual recipient, or whether an image was rendered in an individual recipient’s e-mail (this also applies to any ad banners that may appear in these e-mails).   
|   
| We do not use hidden GIFs (also known as “web bugs”) to track individual recipient behavior or collect information on individuals.  
|   
| No personal data will be sent to RealNetworks with an image request (such as customer ID or e-mail address). No cookies will be set as a result of receiving or viewing a RealNetworks e-mail. Only the data necessary to render the image — the image location and image name — will be sent to the RealNetworks image server.  
|   
| Any images that are rendered are done so by a server that does not generate cookies and logs only date, time, and image name of the image requested.  
|   
| On an anonymous and aggregated basis, RealNetworks may from time to time count the total number of e-mail messages that were opened in specific e-mail campaign.

SECURITY OF PERSONAL AND PAYMENT INFORMATION  
RealNetworks maintains controls to protect the security of information you provide us, including credit card and billing details collected during the purchase process. This is evidenced through:  
|  |   
---|---

|   
| Use of encryption of credit card numbers

REALNETWORKS WEB SITES  
RealNetworks owns and maintains a variety of Web sites (please see Scope of This Privacy Policy, above, for more information). Each of these sites may have its own mailing lists or other methods of contacting customers.

With the exception of WebActive.com, which has its own privacy policy, all RealNetworks sites follow this privacy statement for gathering information or sharing personally identifiable information with third parties.

REALNETWORKS PRODUCTS  
To provide the best possible consumer experience and to operate effectively, RealNetworks software products occasionally send information to servers at RealNetworks. The sections below describe these interactive Internet communications and how they can be disabled if you prefer. Please visit this site when we issue new versions and releases of our products to ensure that you have the most up-to-date information.

RealOne Player and RealOne Premium Services  
RealOne Player allows you to play streaming audio, video and multimedia as well as download, play, record and manage digital music. RealOne premium services are our family of premium consumer subscription services.

Customer Communications  
A RealNetworks account is suggested, but not required, to use the free version of RealOne Player. RealNetworks will prompt users five times to supply account information. To purchase RealOne premium services or products, a RealNetworks account is required. Please see, How to Update and Correct Personal and Account Information, above, for more information about your account.

The RealOne Player consists of interactive Internet applications that perform a variety of communications over the Internet as part of their normal operation. A number of communications features are automatic and are enabled by default. For example, when RealOne Player, Auto-Update and Message Center communicate with RealNetworks servers, the software transmits standard information in order to deliver you the appropriate software, content, messages and updates. This includes information about the RealNetworks product you have installed (including the products name, version and build number), your current operating system, your location information (including zip or postal code, country and your preferred language) and standard Internet communication information including IP address, browser and date.

Once you Sign-in to RealOne Player and RealOne during installation, your account name (your encrypted e-mail address) and user id will be sent in communications with RealNetworks servers. These are both used to verify access premium content, non-premium content, services, features, AutoUpdate, Message Center and other personalized services. RealNetworks may match the account name and user id to personally identifiable information in order to provide you with content, products, services, and software that you’re entitled to and to provide you with relevant information. RealNetworks does not create individual user profiles based on the specific content that is played through our products (see RealNetworks Privacy Principles, above).

You may erase personally identifiable information stored on your machine and may stop RealOne Player transmitting your user name and user id to RealNetworks at any time by signing out. To sign out, simply select Help, then ‘Sign out of RealOne.’ If you choose to sign out, you will not be able to access any premium RealOne member benefits, including product features and premium content.

A RealNetworks account is suggested, but not required, to use the free version of RealOne Player. RealNetworks will prompt users five times to supply account information. To purchase RealOne premium services or products, a RealNetworks account is required. Please see, How to Update and Correct Personal and Account Information, above, for more information about your account.

RealNetworks Content Partner Programs in RealOne  
From time to time, RealNetworks will partner with a content provider, media publisher or sports league to bring you premium content on a subscription basis either as part of our RealOne SuperPass or as a stand-alone subscription offering. Major League Baseball, NASCAR and CNN are examples of these content offerings and we plan to offer more premium content as our service expands. In cases where RealNetworks is performing e-commerce services for a content partner subscription product (outside of RealNetworks SuperPass) a user will most likely begin the order process for the partner's subscription product on the content partner's web site, and will link to a product order path on pages managed by RealNetworks.

In these cases, RealNetworks handles the information input and credit card processing for these content partner subscription products. When a user enters personal information, including name, address and credit card number, on the order form, RealNetworks sends this information to the respective content partner, whose use of such information will be governed by its terms of service and privacy policy. RealNetworks may also retain this data and we will apply our Privacy Policy to our use of such data. Where a user has separately obtained a RealOne Player for use of a content partner subscription product, information supplied to RealNetworks as part of the RealOne Player registration process will be subject to RealNetworks Privacy Policy.

If you have questions about how RealNetworks verifies access to premium content, please see Member Verification, below, for more information.

Installation and Log-in  
Using RealOne Player for the first time requires a user to complete a brief installation process, including signing in if you have created a RealNetworks account. Sign-in also may be required periodically during use of RealOne services and the RealOne Player. Sign-in is required to access premium features, content, services and personalization of products and services. During the installation information is sent in communications with RealNetworks servers. This information may include:  
|  |   
---|---  
| Your age (optional information submitted by you during installation)  
|   
| Your gender (optional information submitted by you during installation)  
|   
| Your content preferences (optional information submitted by you during installation - used to deliver information about products, services, content and special offers you may be interested in)  
|   
| Information about the product you are installing, including the product name, version and build number  
|   
| Your current operating system  
|   
| Your connection speed  
|   
| Your location information, including zip or postal code, what country you are using the product in and your preferred language (used to deliver localized versions of services, products and content)  
|   
| Standard Internet communication information including IP address, browser and date  
|   
| Your RealOne Player’s Security ID number  
  
For more information please refer to What Information We Collect and Store During Product Downloads, Purchases and Installation above.

AutoUpdate  
The RealOne Player, using AutoUpdate, automatically communicates with RealNetworks servers on the Internet to check for updates to RealNetworks software and RealNetworks partner software, such as bug fixes, patches, enhanced functions, missing plug-ins and new versions. When contacting RealNetworks servers, AutoUpdate sends information about your installed RealNetworks products and components to determine upgrade availability. AutoUpdate also has the capability to run independently of RealOne Player to perform background update checks. RealNetworks may download updates during the background checks, when RealOne Player automatically communicates with RealNetworks servers, when you manually check for updates, or when RealOne Player detects a file it does not support. If you prefer to be notified when an auto-update is performed, follow these steps: On the Tools menu, select Preferences, AutoUpdate, and then de-select “Automatically download and install software updates.” However, as we describe above, certain updates to RealOne Player functionality will happen automatically and without advance notification.

Message Center  
The RealOne Player Software, using Message Center, automatically communicates with RealNetworks servers to check for new important messages, including software updates and service bulletins. Message Center can also run independently of RealOne Player to perform background new message checks. Message Center sends information about a user’s message category preferences as well as installed RealNetworks products and components to the servers to allow receipt of suitable product update and other messages. The RealOne Player is set by default to show message headlines and to check for messages once or twice a week. You can change the way messages are displayed and the frequency messages are checked by following these steps: On the view menu, select ‘Message Center’; The Messaging Center dialog appears; On Options, select ‘Delivery Preferences’ and select the desired preferences. If you sign up for services that send messages more frequently than the frequency you have selected, your frequency selection may be adjusted. The first time you use RealOne Player, you will be sent a Welcome Message that will enable you to opt-out of receiving Special Offers messages and opt-in to receive other personalized messages, depending on your categories of interest. Receipt of upgrade information is not optional.

Scheduler  
An application Scheduler, known as “evntsvc.exe,” is installed along with RealOne Player. Once installed, it runs independently of RealOne Player. The Scheduler does not collect personally information or communicate with RealNetworks servers. It is used to remind Auto-Update and Message Center to perform their tasks at pre-scheduled intervals. The Scheduler is also used to automatically launch RealNetworks Media Type Helper. The Media Type Helper ensures the system is configured for correct operation of the RealOne Player with Multi-Purpose Internet Mail Extensions (“MIME”) types, file extensions, Internet protocols and other media types. If a media type has been assigned a different action by a different application, Media Type Helper may override the association and substitute its own association consistent with RealNetworks policies regarding Ask-Tell-Help.

Media Type Helper notifies you that an application has overridden your default settings only when your RealOne Player is currently open and running. You have the option of selecting the "More Info" button in order to learn more. If you select "More Info", information on the file type (e.g., .MP3) and overriding application is sent to RealNetworks. The purpose of sending this information is to display a web page to inform you about the file type and overriding application.

Cookies in RealOne and RealOne Player  
RealOne Player and RealOne services both employ the use of browser cookies and RealPlayer cookies. Please see What Information We Collect During Product Downloads, Purchases and Installation above for more information on Cookies.

You may disable the transmission of RealPlayer cookies from your computer to RealNetworks in RealOne Player by selecting "Tools menu…Preferences…Internet Settings…Enable Cookies." Please note that RealOne Player automatically sets RealOne Player cookies, including cookies that control access to RealOne premium features, when the transmission feature is disabled. These cookies are enabled by default and cannot be turned off, however no cookie data will be transmitted from the user's machine to RealNetworks.

You may disable browser cookies in RealOne Player by selecting “Tools menu…Preferences…Internet Settings…Browser preferences” or by adjusting the privacy settings in your Internet browser.

RealOne Player Services  
RealOne Player features a variety of free and premium web services that are displayed in RealOne player as web pages. These services include Search, Radio Tuner, Artist Guide, CD Look Up, Topic Centers and Channels.

When you access these services RealOne Player sends relevant system and geographic information to display the correct web pages. RealPlayer cookies and browser cookies may be sent in communications with RealNetworks servers when one of these services is accessed. Please see What Information We Collect During Product Downloads, Purchases and Installation above for more information on how we use cookies.

The CD Lookup feature allows you to automatically obtain detailed information (Artist, song track titles, genre) for the CDs you use with RealOne Player. During a request for CD information RealOne Player sends the Table of Contents Code from the CD to a database service in order to look up the CD information. RealNetworks does create profiles that match the songs or albums you record with RealOne Player with personally identifiable information. This feature can be disabled by selecting "Tools…Album Info…Hide" or you can disable this feature by selecting ""Tools…Preferences…Connection…Internet Settings and uncheck the box titled "Enable HTML Clip Info" However, you will not be able to automatically obtain the detailed CD information if the feature is disabled. If you record CDs offline, CD Table of Contents (TOC) information will be sent to RealNetworks when you establish an online connection. Again, you can disable this feature per the instructions noted above.

RealOne Player allows you to automatically look up artist biographies, album art and information through the Artist Guide (Album Info) feature. When you use Artist Guide, information identifying the currently playing track is transmitted to Real.com and content partners so that we can display the appropriate artist information. This information includes Artist Name, Track Name, Album Name and Genre. Selecting “View…Album Info…Hide” can disable the Artist Guide feature.

RealOne Channels bring you the best mix of content on the web. Please be aware that our content partners program and host Channels accessed through RealOne Player. Information you provide on Channels is governed by the Channel partners privacy policy.

RealOne Player Radio includes several features that are designed to make it easy to access your favorite Internet Radio stations: local stations and recently played stations. The local stations feature pre-populates radio stations based on your zip code information. Recently Played Stations pre-populates your Radio page with stations you play regularly. To bring you these features we store information on your local stations and recently played stations in browser cookies on your computer. You may disable these features at any time through the Settings link on the Radio page.

Please note that RealNetworks does not create individual user profiles based on the specific content that is played through our products (see RealNetworks Privacy Principles, above).

Technical Support  
If an error occurs when you are using RealOne Player, a dialog box will appear describing the error. When you select the "More Info" button on the dialog box to obtain more information about the problem, RealOne Player sends anonymous relevant system configuration information to help RealNetworks technical support diagnose and resolve the problem. Selecting “Tools menu Preferences…Internet Settings…Send Support Info” can disable this feature.

RealOne Player Communications with Streaming Media Servers  
Like previous versions of RealPlayer, RealOne Player must communicate with streaming media servers in order to receive the content sent from the servers. Those servers are typically owned and operated by third-party content providers, but these servers might also reside at RealNetworks if we are providing hosting services for a content provider, or are providing content ourselves. This section describes the information transmitted in those communications.

RealNetworks Use of GUIDS in RealOne Player  
The RealOne Player has GUIDs turned off in its default setting.  


What is a GUID?  
A Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) is an alphanumeric identifier used to indicate a unique installation of a product, and is found in many popular software applications such as web browsers and media players. RealNetworks and third party content providers may use GUIDs for aggregate statistical analysis, to authenticate premium content and to personalize products and services.

RealNetworks Use of GUIDS in other products and in future products  
Some RealNetworks products, including some versions of RealPlayer 8, randomly generate a GUID during installation. RealNetworks uses publicly documented standards to generate GUIDs. From time to time, RealNetworks may use a GUID with a unique set of numbers in order to gather and aggregate information about traffic patterns, such as how many times a unique RealPlayer attempts to access content from a server. These statistics help us improve performance and reduce network congestion, providing our users with faster and more reliable access to a wide variety of content.

We may collect data marked by RealPlayer GUIDs in order to understand aggregated traffic patterns and other RealPlayer usage patterns. We use this data in order to measure product performance, better understand types of content that are popular with our users and how our products are used, protect against system failure, analyze how our products interoperate with portable devices and cd burners, and to conduct user surveys. We do not relate GUID marked traffic data to other personal information supplied by users, unless we obtain user consent to do so. Further, consistent with our privacy principles, RealNetworks does not sell or share such information with any third party unless we obtain a user’s advance informed consent.

How to Disable Transmission of the RealPlayer GUID  
To disable transmission of GUIDs, please see the GUID information sections for RealOne Player and RealPlayer 8 under RealNetworks Products.

For more information about enabling or disabling GUIDs with streaming media servers, please go to [http://www.real.com/products/player/](http://www.real.com/products/player/g2/rsdata.html#guid)  
[g2/rsdata.html#guid](http://www.real.com/products/player/g2/rsdata.html#guid)

Playing content  
Whenever you play a streaming media clip, RealOne Player must send certain anonymous information to content broadcasters so that they can send the clip data stream to your computer. This data includes your connection speed, player version, language preference, Zip Code and country.

Connection Quality Information  
By default, RealOne Player sends anonymous connection quality data to broadcast servers to indicate the quality and bandwidth of the stream that you received while playing a clip. This helps the content provider understand the quality of the streaming media service that they are providing to you. Selecting “Tools menu Preferences…Internet Settings…Send connection-quality data to RealServers” can disable this feature.

RealOne Premium Services Member Verification  
Member Verification  
As a RealOne Member, you enjoy an exclusive combination of premier audio and video content, software, and services. Because these benefits are available only to active members, we need to personally identify you whenever you attempt to access premium member benefits, including content, services and software. We keep a record in your member account of any RealOne software that you download or RealOne services for which you sign up so that we can provide you customer service and technical support and in order to prevent fraud.

How Does RealOne Member Verification Work?  
By default, RealNetworks places a RealPlayer cookie and browser cookie on your computer to identify you as a RealOne Member. This optional cookie allows us to recognize you when you attempt to access RealOne benefits so that you don't need to enter your e-mail name and password each time. Please see What Information We Collect and Store During Product Downloads, Purchases and Installation above for more information on how we use cookies.

Opting Out of Cookies  
You may elect not to have your membership information stored in a Web browser or RealPlayer cookie by adjusting your security settings. However, by doing so you will be required to re-enter your e-mail address and password each time that you would like to access RealOne member benefits. Please note that RealOne Player automatically sets RealPlayer cookies that control access to RealOne premium features. These cookies are enabled by default and cannot be turned off. 

RealOne Music Member Verification  
RealOne Music Member Verification is accomplished by the same method as described above for other RealOne Memberships. Because the RealOne Music service delivers premium secure music to our users, it is necessary to keep track of the number of download or streams each member currently has available and to transmit information about requested songs when using the service. This information may include artist name, song name, album name and genre and may be sent in communication with RealNetworks servers along with your membership information. We may also retain aggregated log files of requested content in order to report overall product usage to premium content partners and for aggregate statistical analysis.

Please note that RealNetworks does not create individual user profiles based on the specific content that is played through our products (see RealNetworks Privacy Principles, above).

RealPlayer 8 Customer Communications  
RealPlayer allows you to play real-time (streaming) audio, video and multimedia.

StartCenter — RealPlayer includes a feature called StartCenter that, by default, runs in the Windows system tray when RealPlayer is not actively running. StartCenter is used to help improve startup time and to manage several automatic Internet communications, including software update requests, (AutoUpdate) Channel and Real.com Message Service checks. If you have security software, it may alert you to these communications. These communications are anonymous and do not indicate a security risk. If you wish to disable the StartCenter feature, you may do so in Preferences, however you will not be able to receive automatic notifications when new software or media content is available.

Electronic Registration — During electronic registration, you can optionally send information about your location, e-mail address and connection speed. This information is sent with relevant system and player version information. The e-mail address is used in the event that you elect to receive updates and special offers via e-mail from RealNetworks. All other information is used for aggregate statistical analysis and to provide content that may be of interest to you. You are not required to fill out an electronic registration; choose "Remind me later" during registration. A registration reminder will appear three times, after which you may choose to permanently disable registration reminders.

Channel Checks — RealPlayer periodically checks to see if there are new Channels and Channel headlines available for your player. At this time, RealPlayer sends the Channel servers anonymous information such as your player version, connection speed (for example, so we can offer broadband users high-bandwidth content), country and Zip Code so that we can offer local content, and your language preference. For Channel updates or when you add or remove channels, we need to send data on the Channels you have installed. Your lists of Channels are not associated with you personally. The Channel updating feature can be disabled by selecting View Menu…Preferences…Content…Channels and Live Stations…Settings.

Real.com Message Service — If you have signed up for the Real.com Message Service (News and Entertainment Flashes and Real.com Product Flashes), RealPlayer periodically checks to see if there are any new messages. During this check and when you choose to personalize your messages, RealPlayer sends anonymous information such as the message categories that you have signed up to receive along with information about messages you have already viewed to ensure that only new messages are sent. We also send your country, preferred language and relevant system information in order to send appropriate messages. The messages to which you have subscribed cannot be associated with you individually. The Real.com Message Service can be disabled in Preferences.

Finding New Content: Search, Radio Tuner, Message Personalization, and Add/Remove Channels — RealPlayer Search, Radio Tuner, Message Personalization, and Add/Remove Channel pages display a Web page when you select these features (Note: if Microsoft Internet Explorer version 4 or later is on your computer, these pages are displayed within RealPlayer). When these Web pages are displayed, RealPlayer sends relevant system and geographic information to display the correct page. RealNetworks may use browser cookies when these pages are displayed in order to store your settings and for aggregate statistical analysis. Unless you have previously consented to enable RealNetworks to store your name or e-mail in a cookie (for example, if you establish a My Guide account), there is no way that we can associate your personal information with your use of this feature. You may disable browser cookies. However, this will disable Radio Tuner presets and some other customization settings.

Technical Support — If an error occurs when you are using RealPlayer, a dialog box will appear describing the error. When you select the "More Info" button on the dialog box to obtain more information about the problem, RealPlayer sends anonymous relevant system configuration information to help RealNetworks technical support diagnose and resolve the problem. This feature can be disabled by selecting View menu…Preferences…Support…Send Support Info.

Software Update — RealPlayer is designed to check for the availability of software updates to ensure that you have the latest product improvements. When RealPlayer checks for the availability of a software update, basic information about the product version and installed components along with geographic information, are sent anonymously to RealNetworks to determine whether new free software is available for download. For RealPlayer Plus, the software's serial number is also sent during software update. The serial number is used to determine whether the user has an active subscription for updates, and whether the software is an authorized copy. We do not use the serial number to personally identify our customers. This feature can be disabled for 30-day intervals by selecting View menu…Preferences…Upgrade…Turn off notification for 30 days.

RealPlayer Communications with Streaming Media Servers.  
RealPlayer must communicate with streaming media servers in order to receive the content sent from the servers. Those servers are typically owned and operated by third-party content providers, but these servers might also reside at RealNetworks if we are providing hosting services for a content provider, or are providing content ourselves. This section describes the information transmitted in those communications.

Playing content — Whenever you play a streaming media clip, RealPlayer must send certain anonymous information to content broadcasters so that they can send the clip data stream to your computer. This data includes your connection speed, player version, language preference, Zip Code and country. This communication cannot be disabled; however, you may opt to not identify your Zip Code during electronic registration, or if you have already submitted your Zip Code, you can re-register the product from the Help menu and omit this field to delete it from your product and RealNetworks records.

RealPlayer 8 GUIDs — RealPlayer 8 GUIDs are disabled by default and are only enabled if you turn on the feature in Preferences. RealPlayer 8 has GUIDs disabled by default (set to all zeroes so that it is not unique). In order for your RealPlayer to transmit a unique GUID at all, you must turn on this feature in Preferences (select View menu…Preferences…Support). Some content providers require that you enable your GUID in order to play their content (you will receive an error from the RealServer if a GUID is required to access the content; this error will have a "More Info" button that explains how to enable GUIDs). This is typically because their content is limited-access (such as pay-per-view or for registered members only). If you enable the GUID, it will be sent to all streaming media servers when you play a clip or broadcast. You can turn your GUID back off at any time in Preferences. The GUID can be used by the content provider for authentication, statistical purposes, or to personalize your experience.

How to Disable Transmission of the RealPlayer 8 GUID — At any time, a user may prevent the RealPlayer 8 from transmitting its GUID to a RealServer. On the menu at the top of the RealPlayer, select View, then the Preferences tab, then the Support tab. Under the box entitled "Send RealServer Data" uncheck the box labeled "Send RealPlayer GUID to RealServers." You may enable the transmission of the GUID at a later time by following the same procedure and re-checking the box marked "Send RealPlayer GUID to RealServers."

ZipCode Information — Upon product registration, we may ask users to supply us with the zip code where their RealPlayer is used. The ZipCode is used by RealNetworks to improve traffic routing and reduce network congestion by finding servers that are located closer to your ZipCode address. RealNetworks may also use the ZipCode to offer content and instructions that are most appropriate for your language and region.

For more information about enabling or disabling GUIDs with streaming media servers, please go to [http://www.real.com/products/player/](http://www.real.com/products/player/g2/rsdata.html#guid) [g2/rsdata.html#guid](http://www.real.com/products/player/g2/rsdata.html#guid)

Connection Quality Information — By default, RealPlayer sends anonymous connection quality data to broadcast servers to indicate the quality and bandwidth of the stream that you received while playing a clip. This helps the content provider understand the quality of the streaming media service that they are providing to you. This feature can be disabled by selecting View menu…Preferences…Support…Send connection-quality data to RealServers.

You may disable RealPlayer8 cookies by selecting View menu…Preferences…Support…Enable Cookies.

RealPlayer SuperPass  
Member Verification — As a SuperPass Member, you enjoy an exclusive combination of premier audio and video content, software, and services. Because these benefits are available only to active members, we need to personally identify you with your member ID whenever you attempt to play or download SuperPass content or software in order to verify that you have rights to access these exclusive benefits. We keep a record in your member account of any SuperPass software that you download or SuperPass services for which you sign up so that we can provide you customer service and technical support and in order to prevent fraud. However, we do not store information about the SuperPass content you play with your personal account information.

How Does SuperPass Member Verification Work? — By default, RealNetworks places a cookie-a small text file-on your computer when you first log in to access SuperPass content, software, or services. This optional cookie contains a member identification number that allows us to recognize you when you attempt to access SuperPass benefits so that you don't need to enter your e-mail name and password each time. This cookie is placed in your Web browser (so that you can access SuperPass Web pages) and in your RealPlayer (so that you can play SuperPass streaming audio and video). This cookie is only transmitted to RealNetworks, and the contents are never shared with outside companies.

Opting Out of SuperPass Cookies — You may elect not to have your user ID stored in a Web browser or RealPlayer cookie by adjusting your security settings in your browser. However, by doing so you will be required to re-enter your e-mail address and password each time that you would like to access SuperPass exclusive content, software, or services.

CD Lookup — The CD Lookup feature allows you to automatically obtain detailed information (Artist, song track titles, genre) for the CDs you use with RealJukebox. During a request for CD information RealJukebox sends the Table of Contents Code from the CD to a database service in order to look up the CD information. RealNetworks does not store any personally identifiable information about the songs or albums you record with RealJukebox. This feature can be disabled by selecting Tools…Preferences…Internet…Options…Automatic CD Lookup Information. However, you will not be able to automatically obtain the detailed CD information if the feature is disabled. If you record CDs offline, CD Table of Contents (TOC) information will be sent to RealNetworks when you establish an online connection. Again, you can disable this feature per the instructions noted above.

Finding New Content: Search and Radio Tuner — RealJukebox Search and Radio Tuner pages use Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) to display a Web page in RealJukebox when you select these features. When these Web pages are displayed, RealJukebox sends relevant system and geographic information to display the correct page. RealNetworks may use IE cookies when these pages are displayed in order to store your settings and for aggregate statistical analysis. Unless you have previously consented to enable RealNetworks to store your name or e-mail in a cookie (for example, if you establish a My Guide account), there is no way that we can associate your personal information with your use of these features. You may disable IE cookies in Internet Explorer. However, this will disable Radio Tuner presets and some other customization settings.

Artist Guide — RealJukebox allows you to automatically look up artist biographies, album art and information, concert dates, etc. through the Artist Guide (Track Info) feature. When you use Artist Guide, anonymous information identifying the currently playing track is transmitted to Real.com and content partners so that we can display the appropriate artist information. The Artist Guide feature can be disabled in Tools…Preferences…Internet…Options. When enabled, the Artist Guide is displayed using Internet Explorer inside RealJukebox. RealNetworks may use IE cookies to store your settings, recommend content that may be of interest, and for aggregate statistical analysis. Unless you have previously consented to enable RealNetworks to store your name or e-mail in a cookie (for example, if you establish a My Guide account), there is no way that we can associate your personal information with your use of this feature. You may disable IE cookies in Internet Explorer.

Music Guide — When RealJukebox is started while you're connected to the Internet, RealJukebox by default checks to see if there are updates available for the Music Guide page. The information that may be updated includes: Music Guide page, list of supported hardware devices, RealJukebox Home Page layout, promotion button, and default (offline) pages for the Search, Radio Tuner, and Music Guide features. During this check, RealJukebox sends anonymous information about the RealJukebox version you are running. RealNetworks does not gather any personally identifiable information during this communication. Automatic Updating of Music Guide can be disabled by selecting Tools…Preferences…Internet…Options…Automatic Music Guide updates.

Technical Support — If an error occurs when you are using RealJukebox, a dialog box will appear describing the error. When you select the "More Info" button on the dialog box to obtain more information about the problem, RealJukebox sends anonymous relevant system configuration information to help RealNetworks technical support diagnose and resolve the problem. This feature can be disabled by selecting Tools…Preferences…Internet…Options…Faster access to Technical Support.

Software Updates — RealJukebox is designed to check for the availability of software updates to ensure that you have the latest product improvements. When RealJukebox checks for the availability of a software update, basic information about the product version and installed components are anonymously sent to RealNetworks to determine whether new free software is available for download. For RealJukebox Plus, the software's serial number is also sent during software update. The serial number is used to determine whether the user has an active subscription for updates, and whether the software is an authorized copy. We do not use the serial number to personally identify our customers. This feature can be disabled for 30-day intervals by selecting Tools…Preferences…Internet…Options…Automatic Update Notification.

Cookies — RealDownload transmits optional Internet Explorer cookies in three ways:  


  1. When RealDownload is used, our advertising system delivers an anonymous cookie that indicates which "InfoWindow" was displayed in the product. This cookie is used to ensure that the next time you use RealDownload, the "InfoWindow" that you see is new. 
  2. RealDownload loads a Web page when it displays advertising Windows (see below). These Web pages use Internet Explorer, and as a result, transmit any pre-existing Internet Explorer cookies to the Web page content provider. In some cases, this is RealNetworks (for example, when a Real.com guide page is displayed while you download, any pre-existing Real.com cookies are transmitted). RealNetworks does not use cookies to associate download information with your personal information. 
  3. If you are downloading from a Web site that uses cookies, RealDownload will temporarily store and pass on these cookies to your browser. RealDownload does not edit the cookies sent by the download Web site, and these cookies are not sent to RealNetworks. 



You may disable these cookies by turning off your Internet Explorer browser cookies. Your browser does not have to accept cookies in order for RealDownload to function.

Advertising Windows — RealDownload may contain advertisements and "InfoWindows" that are sent dynamically from our server when the product is used. Like the banner ads on many Web sites, these advertisements are delivered via an ad management service — currently DoubleClick — that may use cookies to ensure that you see relevant advertisements. You may go to http://www.privacychoices.org/optout.htm to view DoubleClick's privacy policy and to opt out of receiving cookies from DoubleClick. When you click on an ad, RealNetworks is notified that this ad was selected, but only in an anonymous manner that is not tracked back to you individually. RealNetworks creates aggregate reports on user traffic patterns for advertisers and partners. As RealNetworks does not track the usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser or partner does not know which ads any individual clicked on. RealDownload advertising windows sometimes link to other Web sites. RealNetworks is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of those Web sites.

More Info — When you complete a file download with RealDownload, you have the option of selecting the "More Info" button in order to learn more about that type of file. If you select More Info, RealDownload transmits the file type (e.g., .MP3, .ZIP) to RealNetworks so that we can recommend an application to use to open that file type.

Netzip FastView And Netzip Classic Customer Communications  
Registration — When you install Netzip FastView or Netzip Classic, you are asked to fill out a registration form. During this process, you have the opportunity to decline further notification of software updates and important events. You may remove yourself from the mailing list at any time. We use e-mail addresses to communicate with customers who purchase or evaluate one of our products. These e-mail messages may contain installation instructions, re-download information, and technical support information. Note regarding FastView: FastView contains software developed by third parties, including Verity and Adobe Systems. RealNetworks is not responsible for the privacy practices of these companies; please refer to their Web sites to review their policies-Adobe Systems Privacy Policy; Verity's Privacy Policy.

THIRD PARTY RELATIONSHIPS  
Relationships with Third Party Advertising Services  
Advertisements displayed on RealNetworks Web sites or embedded in other media content provided by RealNetworks may be delivered via an advertising management service. When you view a web page on our web site that contains advertising provided one of our advertising management services, the advertising service company may place a cookie on or retrieve a cookie from your computer if you have enabled cookies. This cookie may uniquely designate your computer/browser, without containing any personally identifying information such as your name or e-mail address. RealNetworks does not intentionally provide any of your personally identifiable information to the advertising service without your permission or informed consent.

RealNetworks uses DoubleClick and other advertising services in order to serve ads on our web pages. Third party advertising services recently used by RealNetworks are listed below.

When you search for specific content on RealNetworks web sites, the search terms may be embedded in the “search string” that appears in the URL display window of your web browser. Certain advertising services or third party content providers may associate these search strings with cookies they set or retrieve from our pages.

While RealNetworks does not have access to cookies set by third parties on your hard drive, you may be concerned about the potential practices of advertising management services and wish to disable this functionality as follows:

You may opt out from receiving cookies in your browser if you do not wish to receive cookies from advertising servers. This is a current list of recent advertising service providers to RealNetworks and the URL link to the page of their privacy policy that instructs you how to opt out from their cookies or informs you about their cookies policy:

Information Collected When You Acquire Third Party Products  
From time to time, RealNetworks enters into partnerships with other companies to provide you with the opportunity to sample or purchase a product or service that might be of interest to you. We also partner with other companies to offer plug-ins, products and services that enhance the experience of using a RealPlayer, RealJukebox or other RealNetworks product.

If you purchase a product or service developed or owned by another company, RealNetworks will seek your informed consent prior to giving that company information you provide to us. We will never sell, rent or disclose to third parties our customers' personally identifiable information collected from the distribution of RealNetworks products or gathered on a RealNetworks Web site unless we are required to do so by law or receive your advance informed consent.

By ordering certain third-party products or services promoted and/or distributed from RealNetworks, you may have left Web sites owned or operated by RealNetworks and your election to give other companies any personal or E-Reg information is not governed by RealNetworks privacy policies or terms of service.

Special Third-Party Relationships  
On occasion, RealNetworks will offer our product users and Web site visitors the opportunity to participate in third-party or co-branded promotions, sweepstakes or special programs.

The use of any information provided by a user in entering such a third-party promotion will be specified prior to the user providing such information. We will also specify the manner in which such information is to be used. If your personal information is to be shared with a third party, it will only be done with your advance informed consent.

These relationships will be clearly identified by RealNetworks.

The privacy policy or policies governing such third-party promotions and/or co-branded programs will be specified.

In addition, RealNetworks offers a variety of "plug-in" products that are compatible with certain RealNetworks products such as RealPlayer or RealJukebox. While we endeavor to fully research and disclose how such plug-ins utilize personal information, RealNetworks is not responsible for the operation of plug-ins provided by third parties and we strongly encourage you to visit their Web sites and read the privacy policies that govern their usage. RealNetworks will not provide personally identifiable information to our product plug-in partners without first obtaining the informed consent of our users.
