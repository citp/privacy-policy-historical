## PRIVACY ON SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES 

When you use a RealNetworks product or game through a Social Networking Site (such as Facebook, Google+, MySpace, or similar) (“SNS”), you allow RealNetworks to access certain person and non-personal information that you provided to such SNS such as your user ID, first and last name, profile picture, usage data for that product or game, and any other information you make publically available on such SNS. By accessing a RealNetworks product or game through an SNS, you are authorizing RealNetworks to collect, store and use all information that you agreed the SNS could provide to RealNetworks through the SNS. RealNetworks collection, storage and use of your information is governed by this privacy policy.

## WHEN AND HOW DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES?

RealNetworks does not use your personal information for purposes incompatible with those listed above. RealNetworks does not sell, rent, or share your personal information to a third party unless you consent to provide such information to a third party partner or content service. 

In some cases, access to certain products and services, such as content subscription products or products distributed by third parties, may require the provision of personal information to a third party, such as a content provider or distributor. In such cases, this will be stated during the registration process, in the terms of use, through the distribution process, or in a similar manner. The third party's use of such information is governed by that party's privacy policy, and RealNetworks use is governed by this privacy policy. Please visit the privacy policy of the content partner to make sure you understand how they use the personal information you provide to them. If you do not wish for such a transfer to take place, you should not register for the applicable product or service. Additionally, RealNetworks may be required to provide specific access and usage information to certain content providers and rights holders as a condition of content licensing and royalties. In such cases, RealNetworks may provide non-personal information such as content usage, access, demographic and other information without your personal information (your name, billing information, email address) to the content provider. 

RealNetworks may disclose relevant information about our customers to our contractors (e.g. a customer service contractor or a credit card clearing service) in order for them to provide specific services for RealNetworks, and to better serve our customers. RealNetworks contractors are bound by strict contractual requirements to keep all personal information they process strictly confidential and to use such information solely on behalf of RealNetworks. 

Also, RealNetworks may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law; (b) comply with the order of a competent judicial authority in any jurisdiction; (c) comply with legal process served on RealNetworks; (d) protect and defend the rights or property of RealNetworks; or (e) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of RealNetworks products or the public at large.

RealNetworks websites, products and services contain links to other websites, and products and services. Because RealNetworks does not manage such third party websites, products and services, they are not governed by this privacy policy. RealNetworks is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Websites or products. Please visit the privacy policies of these third party sites in order to understand their privacy policies and data collection practices.
