You should refer back to this document from time to time to make sure that you are aware of any changes or modifications that may be made to this policy. If any such changes are made, they will be posted at this site.

**Overview**  
Technology and new marketing practices have increased the amount of client information collected and shared in today’s marketplace. Consumers are concerned about the impact this development has or might have on their privacy and reputation. At RealBiz Media Group, we are sensitive to the importance of these concerns. We want to serve consumers as effectively and conveniently as possible and such service involves making use of technology and client information. But we also want our clients to be confident that their relationship with RealBiz Media Group is treated with appropriate confidentiality. We therefore commit to clients that we will take reasonable steps to protect the privacy of the information shared with us in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**Recognition of your right to privacy**  
We recognize your right to privacy at RealBiz Media Group. Thus, we recognize that you have a right to expect that your personal information will remain private and secure. We will maintain standards to ensure that any information that is requested by us is held private and secure at all times. The same standards apply regardless of whether you are a current or former client of RealBiz Media Group.

**Types of Client Information**  
Information about you may be accumulated from a variety of sources. For example, we may collect nonpublic personal information about you from:

  * Email communications that you send us or confirmations that we receive when you open email from us
  * Comparison of our client list to other lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our clients
  * Consumer reporting agencies
  * Other sources for reasons such as improving personalization of our service. For example, we may try to provide you with product recommendations or special offers that we think will interest you



All of these pieces of information will be referred to collectively throughout this policy as “Client Information.” We will limit the use and collection of Client Information to that which is necessary to administer our business, and to offer opportunities that we think will be of interest to you.
