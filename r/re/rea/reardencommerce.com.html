    <p>We also reserve the right to transfer personal information we have about you in the event we sell, merge or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale, merger or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use personal information you have provided to us in a manner that is consistent with our Privacy Statement.

    <h5 id="your-choices">Your Choices</h5>
    <p>We offer you certain choices about what information we collect from you, how we use and disclose the information, and how we communicate with you. Here are the choices we offer.</p>
    <h5>Use of Rearden Commerce Products and Services</h5>
    <p>Many of the Rearden Commerce products and services are designed to facilitate and enhance consumers' ability to interact with and obtain products and services from third parties. This business model requires Rearden Commerce to share information about you with various providers (such as airlines, hotels, restaurants, car services and reservation aggregators) and other third parties. These third parties are not our service providers or agents; they may process the personal information we provide to them in accordance with their own privacy practices and privacy notices. You may choose not to provide your personal information to Rearden Commerce or such third parties by refraining from using our products or services. To deactivate your account, you may email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@reardencommerce.com">privacy@reardencommerce.com</a>.
