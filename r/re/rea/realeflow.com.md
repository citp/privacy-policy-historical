This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason and at our sole discretion. We will
notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy on our Website. You
are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.
This Privacy Policy only applies to the Website and Products operated by Realeflow. This Privacy Policy
does not apply to companies that Realeflow does not own or control, or to individuals that Realeflow
does not employ or manage. The Products and the Website may contain links to other sites. Realeflow

information for statistical purposes to improve the Products and Website we provide.
Passively Collected Information: When you interact with us through the Products and/or the Website,
we receive and store certain additional non-personally-identifiable information. For example, we

Again, Realeflow never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you
personally.

These companies may have access to your PII to the extent necessary to perform their functions, but we
do not allow them to share or use any of your PII for any other purpose. Sharing information with these
companies enables us to provide you with information about a variety of products and services that
might interest you. These companies will give you the opportunity to choose not to receive email
messages in the future.
We may also share your PII under these situations:
