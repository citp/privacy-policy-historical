UPDATED ON September 06, 2018

**Real Vision Group SEZC**  and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, “Real Vision,” “we,” “us,” and “our”), want you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information from and about you because we understand you are concerned about your privacy, and we want to maintain your trust.

This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect from all sources including in connection with our websites and mobile sites (each a “Site” and collectively the “Sites”), applications (“apps”), electronic newsletters and widgets (all such Sites, apps, newsletters and widgets being collectively referred to below as the “Services”) that link to this Privacy Policy.

This Policy describes Real Vision’s collection and use of users’ Personal Information. It also describes generally Real Vision’s practices for handling Other Information (e.g., interests, demographics and services usage, etc.) collected through the Real Vision Services. As described more fully below, we share information with our subsidiaries and third-party business partners (“Real Vision Affiliates”) for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. By using the Real Vision Services or by providing personal information to us, you agree both to our Terms of Use (which are incorporated herein) and the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.

You may choose not to submit requested information online (see Other Information below), but that may limit the services Real Vision is able to provide to you.

 **6.3 Your California Privacy Rights:**  California Law permits our customers who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact our customer service representatives through the messaging functionality made available to you on the Site and through the Services, and provide your name and the address to which you would like us to respond.

Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on the Real Vision Services. Your use of the Real Vision Services or your provision of Personal Information to us following these changes means that you accept the revised Privacy Policy.

 **7.2 Location of Data:**  Your Personal Information may be stored, transferred to, and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers, and by using our products and services, you consent to the processing and transfer of information to countries outside of your country of residence, including the United States, which may have different data protection rules than in your country.
