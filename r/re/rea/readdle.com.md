Readdle takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.

We are at the business of making best productivity tools out there and selling them directly to you, our customer. While other companies might base their entire existence on selling their users data, we decided that we will never base our business on activities like this and we are committed to this decision.

That's why we treat your data very seriously and always try to avoid having access to your data if it is possible by nature of the application or service we provide to you.

Most of our mobile app products collect only anonymized or personally unidentifiable usage data that help us make our products better. Some products like Spark have access to more information and thus have their own or additional privacy policies. Below you can find more detailed description of information that we collect at Readdle and how we use it. By using any of our products, you accept the terms of this privacy policy. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, your choice is not to use our website or our products.

Readdle takes your privacy seriously. This privacy policy covers how Readdle treats personal information that Readdle collects and receives when you use the Readdle website (“Website”) or products, except Spark and Fluix. If you are using our Spark or Fluix products, please refer to [Spark Privacy Policy](https://sparkmailapp.com/privacy) and [Fluix Privacy Policy](https://fluix.io/privacy-policy) respectively. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.

Readdle collects information when you use Readdle products or services, when you visit Website pages or the pages of certain Readdle partners. Readdle may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies.

Readdle automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, Readdle cookie information, and the page you request.

We may collect additional information related to your contact with our customer support team or store results when you respond to a survey. Also, we receive and store your email when you subscribe to Readdle newsletters and marketing communications.

You also may provide information, such as reviews, feedback, comments, etc., which may be published or displayed (" **posted** ") on public areas of the our Website or our blogs or forum, via our products, or transmitted to other users of the Website or third parties (collectively, " **Content** "). Your Content is posted on and transmitted to others at your own risk. We cannot control the actions of other users of the Website with whom you may choose to share your Content. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that your Content will not be viewed by unauthorized persons.

We may collect information about your mobile device and internet connection, including the application-specific device identifier, IP address, operating system, browser type, mobile network information, location, installed email, etc.

Readdle does not rent, sell, or share personally identifiable information about you with non-affiliated third parties (other than our subsidiaries and affiliates), except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:

  * We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
  * We believe it is necessary to share personally identifiable information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Readdle's terms of use, this privacy policy, or as otherwise required by law.
  * We believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of our company, our customers or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
  * We transfer your information in the event a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution or sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding and you agree to and do hereby consent to our assignment or transfer of rights to your personal information.



We also use standard technologies, which may include cookies, flash cookies, and other technologies, to collect and track information about how you use our Website and to record certain information. For example, we may collect and/or log Internet protocol addresses, Internet domain names, the Web browser and operating system used to access our Website, the files visited, the time spent in each file, and the time and date of each visit. We may collect these through the use of log files and Web beacons that could enable us to track your activity. Cookies are files that can be sent from a Website via your browser to be placed on your computer's hard drive. Thereafter, when you visit a Website, a message is sent back to the Web server by the browser accessing the Website. You may elect not to accept cookies by changing the designated settings on your Web browser. The information collected from the use of cookies is used and analyzed to improve our Website, such as by gaining a better understanding of your interests and requirements regarding our Website. You can set your browser to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you the opportunity to decide whether or not to accept it. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer.

Some our products allows you to subscribe to Readdle newsletters. This process is completely opt-in and you can always opt-out of receiving future e-mail messages and newsletters by ending your subscription. Unsubscribe instructions are located within each newsletter and on our website, or you may contact our [customer support](https://web.archive.org/support) team and ask them to unsubscribe you manually.

When you contact our customer support via email or using our online form your email will be retained in our customer support system. We may use this email to contact you later with updates about your request, with information about related features and other announcements or to request your feedback.

The safety and security of your information also depends on you. You should not share your email user name and password with anyone. If you find out that anyone has improperly obtained your login credentials and accesses your email account through Spark, you should immediately change your password. We are not responsible for such unauthorized access unless the access is our fault.

We use third party Software and services such as Google Analytics, Facebook Analytics and Amplitude to collect and analyze how people use Readdle applications. This data helps us improve our products and services and better tailor our advertising campaigns on Google, Facebook and other platforms. Also, we use third party software from Dropbox, Evernote and others to provide you with various useful functions across our apps. All these third parties may collect information about you and your usage of our applications in accordance with their respective privacy policies.

We limit access to personally identifiable information about you to employees, contractors and service providers who we believe reasonably need to have access to that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.

We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that are designed to comply with federal regulations to protect personal information about you.

It is our policy to post any changes we make to our privacy policy on this page. Your continued use of our Website or products after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the privacy policy (posted at [readdle.com/privacy](https://readdle.com/privacy)) periodically for updates.
