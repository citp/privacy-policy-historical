## Information We Collect

#### 1\. Unregistered Users

We encourage you to register with us in order to take advantage of Read Print's many personalization features. However, you may choose not to register and take advantage of those features of our Website for which registration is not required.

If you do not register, we will only collect the following Anonymous Information from you:  
We may log your IP Address in order to help diagnose problems with our server, administer our Website and track usage statistics. An “ **IP Address** ” is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet.  In some cases your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session

We do not link your IP Address to any Personal Information to identify you.

If you reached our Website by clicking on a link or advertisement on another website, we log that information to help us maximize our Internet exposure, and to understand the interests of our Users.  
All of this information is collected and used only in the aggregate; that is, it is entered into our database, where we can use it to generate overall reports on the visitors of our Website, but not reports about individual Users.

We may also place a Cookie on your computer. “ **Cookies** ” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a website.  Read Print may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on the Website, to help us understand how Users use our Website, and to help us to improve our Website.  Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. A Cookie may contain information that allows us to track your path through our Website and to determine whether you have visited us before. However, unless you register with us, it does not contain and is not linked to any Personal Information that would allow us to identify you. If you choose to disable Cookies, some areas of the Website (and other websites) may not work properly.

#### 2\. Registered Users

## Disclosure of your Personal Information.

Read Print does not sell or rent any personal information to any third party, other than our partners, as discussed in this Privacy Policy.

We may share some of your Personal Information with these Affiliates, in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy. Sharing this information allows us to better understand the ways in which our various product and service offerings can assist our Users.

We also may share your Personal Information with third parties specifically engaged by Read Print to provide services to Read Print (such as, but not limited to, market research firms, marketing services providers and advertising agencies), in which case we will require those parties to agree to use any such Personal Information solely for the purpose of providing the specified services to Read Print.

We may disclose your Personal Information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on Read Print; or (b) to protect and defend the rights, safety, or property of Read Print, users of our Website, or third parties. If our company or our assets are acquired by another company, that company will possess the Personal Information collected by us and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.

## Steps we take to protect your personal information.

Read Print has implemented security procedures to help protect the personal information stored in our systems. For example, we limit access to Personal Information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information. We also employ processes to protect against unauthorized access to your personal information. However, no company, including Read Print, can fully eliminate security risks associated with Personal Information.
