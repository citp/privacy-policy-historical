**Reagan.com Website Privacy Statement**

This website is a service of Reagan.com, LLC (hereinafter referred to as “ **Reagan.com** ”, “ **we** ”, “ **us** ”, or “ **our** ”).  We provide this statement to identify for you the privacy practices that we adhere to with respect to this website, including an explanation of: (1) the categories of personally identifiable information about you that may be collected and the choices available to you regarding collection, use, and distribution of the information; (2) how the information is used and the categories of persons or entities with whom the information may be shared; (3) how you can opt in or out of Reagan.com promotional e-mail; (4) the kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information; (5) how you can review and request changes to the information; (6) how we notify visitors and users of this website of changes to this privacy statement; and (7) the privacy policies that apply to subscribers to Reagan.com products and services. 

Questions regarding Reagan.com’s website privacy statement should be directed to [support@reagan.com](mailto:support@reagan.com).  Or by mail to Reagan.com, 230 S. Clark Street, Suite 302, Chicago, IL 60604. 

**Collection of Information**

The information collected by Reagan.com falls into two categories: (1) information voluntarily supplied by visitors to and users of the website and (2) tracking information recorded as visitors and users navigate through the website.  Some of this information is personally identifiable information, but much of it is not. Personally identifiable information is information that identifies a particular person. 

As a general policy, Reagan.com does not automatically collect “personal” information from visitors to this website.  However, certain non-personal information of visitors is recorded by the standard operation of the Reagan.com Service.  We use so-called “cookies,” which are small files stored on a computer's hard drive to simplify and improve a user’s Web experience.  The cookie does not personally identify you.  Our website may store information in a cookie about your computer configuration so that it can more efficiently provide information to you the next time you visit the site.  Or, your browser program might save a cookie with your username and password so that a website's server will automatically recognize you the next time you access the site. 

Generally, information tracked by our system includes the type of browser being used by the visitor, the type of operating system in use by the visitor and the domain name of the visitor's Internet service provider.  By having this information, Web pages optimized for a particular visitor's computer are automatically made available to that visitor.  We may also use aggregate, non-personally identifiable information to determine the number of visitors to this website and to determine which products and services are the most popular with our website visitors. 

We may also use one or more advertising network providers to help present advertisements or other content on this website.  These advertising network providers use cookies, web beacons, or other technologies to serve you advertisements or content tailored to interests you have shown by browsing on this and other websites you have visited.  Advertising network providers collect non-personally identifiable information such as your browser type, your operating system, web pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed, and other click stream data. 

The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by these advertising network providers is subject to their own privacy policies, not our privacy policy for this website or its Service.  If you do not want the benefits of this advertising, you may opt-out by visiting [ww.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp](http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp).

In addition to the information that is collected by our system, you may also voluntarily provide to Reagan.com when you visit certain areas of this website personal information about yourself, such as your name, address, email address, and other information that may personally identify you.  Although this information is not generally required by Reagan.com for you to use this website, Reagan.com may be unable to provide you with some products and services that we make available to other visitors to our website without the information.  You also will not be able to order selected products or services over the Reagan.com website unless you provide certain personally identifying information about yourself.  The information you supply will help us to offer you more personalized features, to tailor our website to your interests and make it more useful to you.  Our system will remember some of this information the next time you login to our secure eCommerce section and use our website, but can be changed later by you. 

Reagan.com is especially concerned with children who access and use this website.  Reagan.com does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen.  If Reagan.com (or any other website operator) collects personal information from children under the age of thirteen, we must first obtain parental consent.  Children should always get permission from their parents before sending any information about themselves over the Internet.  Reagan.com strongly encourages parents to supervise their children’s online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help control access to certain content on the Internet.  These tools can also help prevent children from disclosing online personal information without parental permission. 

 **Use and Sharing of Information**

Reagan.com will generally use any personally identifiable data that you provide to us when you visit this site only for the purposes described at the time it is collected and otherwise to contact you to make you aware of other products and services that you may find of interest.  We consider the personally identifiable information contained in our business records to be confidential.  We may sometimes disclose personally identifiable information about you to our affiliates or to others who work for us, as necessary to provide our Services to you.  We may be required by law or legal process to disclose certain personally identifiable information about you without your consent and without notice in order to comply with a valid legal process such as a subpoena, court order, or search warrant. 

 **Links to Other Websites**

This website may contain links to or from other websites whose privacy policies and practices we do not control. You should carefully review the privacy policies and practices of each such site in order to determine how each site may use any personal information you provide. 

 **Security**

All information gathered on our website is stored within a database that is designed to be accessible only to Reagan.com and its specifically authorized contractors and vendors.  Although Reagan.com implements security measures to protect from disclosure or interception any such personally identifiable information that you may voluntarily supply to us, we cannot guarantee in all instances the complete security of such information.  

 **Changes to Information**

You may review and change information that you provide to us through this website by returning to the pages where you entered it, and reviewing or changing the information directly. You may also request changes to some information, such as billing and account information, by sending an email to support@reagan.com, if you are able to verify your identity using a Reagan.com username, secret question and answer, or another identifier requested by Reagan.com. 

 **Changes to this Privacy Statement**

We may change this privacy statement from time to time, so please check this statement periodically when you visit this website. If we change this privacy statement at some point in the future, we will post the changes on our website. By continuing to use the website after we post any changes, you accept and agree to the most recent version of the Reagan.com privacy statement.

  1. Remove or disable access to the material that is alleged to be infringing; and
