When you visit Kitbag, you can surf the site anonymously and access important information without revealing your identity. However, in order to provide better service, we may use "cookies" to track your visit, which make it easier for you to log on during future visits. A cookie is a small piece of information that the Web site stores on your Web browser and can later retrieve. We use cookies for a number of administrative purposes, such as recording your log in status so you do not have to log in to the site at every visit (unless you wish to).

**How does Kitbag protect visitor information?**

Kitbag has a committed Security Policy. Kitbag will retain copies of the information provided when you register on the website, order any products from the site and enter into any competitions. Kitbag implements a number of sophisticated security measures to ensure the safety of any personal information provided. The information is contained on a secure server, which is accessible only by a limited number of employees who have authorised access rights to such information. All sensitive and credit card information supplied by any visitor to store.manutd.com is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. SSL is commonly-used for managing the security of message transmission on the Internet through public-and-private key encryption and a digital certificate that establishes your credentials when doing Internet business or other on-line transactions. This certificate is issued by a certification authority, in our case Verisign. To see the certificate for this site click Verisign here. When you are asked to enter any personal details or credit card information the web site will be secure. This is easily identifiable by an icon in the bottom of the browser window resembling an unbroken key or a closed lock. SSL ensures that the information being sent is secure. Your card number will be encrypted and replaced by a unique transaction reference number. Kitbag uses online bank secure servers provided by DataCash and does not hold any customer card details on any Kitbag server at any time. To remove any name and address details please see remove details section in the Kitbags help menu.

In addition, we have security procedures in place to protect our paper based systems and computerised databases from access by unauthorised persons and against unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage, and only allow access to them when it is absolutely necessary to do so, and then under strict guidelines as to what use may be made of the personal information contained within them.
