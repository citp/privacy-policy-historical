    			<div class="contentCopy">

			<p>AEBN has created this privacy policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy.
				The following discloses our information gathering practices for AEBN websites.</p>

			<p>AEBN has established a privacy policy with the mission of building member trust and confidence
				by promoting the use of fair information practices. If you have questions or concerns regarding
				this statement, you should first contact
				<a href="mailto:support@realtouch.com" title="support@realtouch.com">support@realtouch.com</a>.</p>
			<h4>This Theater is owned and operated by: AEBN</h4>

			<p>
				AEBN<br>
				500 Archdale Drive<br>
				Charlotte, NC 28217<br>
				Phone: 704-529-1600 (Option 5 - RealTouch)<br>
				Customer Service Department: <a href="mailto:support@realtouch.com" title="support@realtouch.com">support@realtouch.com</a> or
				1.877.433.4146<br>
			</p>

			<h4>Cookies</h4>

			<p>AEBN uses session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A cookie is a small
				text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on
				this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable
				information you submit while on our site.</p>

			<p>We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you
				close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of
				time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet
				browser's "help" file. For more information on cookies
				<a target="_blank" href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/cookie.htm">click here</a>.</p>

			<p>If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our
				site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited.</p>

			<p>Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) may use cookies on our site. We have no
				access to or control over these cookies.</p>

			<p>Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (such as username
				and email address). We use customer contact information from the registration form to send
				the user special offers and updates from AEBN. The customer's contact information is also used
				to contact the person when necessary.</p>

			<h4>Choice/Opt-out</h4>

			<p>As an individual, you have the opportunity to limit the personal information you provide. We
				provide you with the opportunity to 'opt out' of having your personally identifiable information
				used for certain purposes when we ask for this information. If you no longer wish to receive
				our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt out of receiving them by contacting
				us at <a href="mailto:support@realtouch.com" title="support@realtouch.com">support@realtouch.com</a>, 704.529.1600
				(Option 5- RealTouch), or 500 Archdale Drive Charlotte NC, 28217.</p>

			<h2>Information Collection &amp; Use</h2>

			<h4>Registration</h4>

			<p>In order to use this website, you must first complete the registration form and create a user
				name and password. During registration you are required to give contact information including
				your name and email address. We use this information to contact you about the services on our
				site in which you have expressed interest.</p>

			<p>AEBN is the sole owner of the information collected on www.realtouch.com. AEBN collects
				personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on our website.</p>

			<h4>Access to Personally Identifiable Information</h4>

			<p>If your personally identifiable information changes, you may update it by making the change on
				our site or by contacting Customer Support using the information located at the top of this page.</p>

			<h4>Surveys or Contests</h4>

			<p>From time to time, we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys
				on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information
				from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary, and you therefore
				have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically
				includes contact information (such as name and address) and demographic information (such as zip
				code).</p>

			<p>We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, monitor site traffic,
				personalize the site (in the case of anonymous information collected in surveys), and send
				participants an email newsletter.</p>

			<p>We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; that company
				is prohibited from using our users' personally identifiable information for any other purpose.
				We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or
				survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.</p>

			<h2>Uses of Information</h2>

			<h4>Email</h4>

			<p>AEBN members and affiliates receive periodic email notices that include exclusive special offers
				and information about sales, promotions, new releases, and other relevant information. If you
				no longer wish to receive these emails, you may opt out by contacting us at 704.529.1600
				(Option 5 - RealTouch), <a href="mailto:support@realtouch.com" title="support@realtouch.com">support@realtouch.com</a>,
				or 500 Archdale Drive Charlotte NC, 28217.</p>

			<h4>Non-personal information</h4>

			<p>Like many websites, we collect and analyze standard log file information and Session ID
				information to analyze site traffic, improve site performance, and prevent fraud. Session
				IDs are bits of code on your computer that assist your browser in navigating our site. We do
				not associate personal information with log file information or cookies, except when needed to
				prevent fraud.</p>

			<h4>Legal Disclaimer</h4>

			<p>AEBN reserves the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law
				and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a
				judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our website.</p>

			<p>AEBN websites may contain links to other sites. AEBN is not responsible for the privacy
				practices or the content of such websites. Our site uses a secure online ordering system that
				enables clients to purchase online. AEBN collects users' financial information, such as account
				and credit card numbers, for verification purposes only. Financial information that is
				collected is used to bill the user for products and services, and never for any other reason.</p>

			<h4>Security</h4>

			<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive
				information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or
				order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). To learn
				more about SSL, follow this link:
				<a target="_blank" href="http://www.verisign.com/ssl/ssl-information-center/index.html">Verisign</a>.
			</p>

			<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted
				to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of online transmission or
				electronic storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially
				acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

			<p>If you have any questions about security on our web site, you can email us at
				<a href="mailto:support@realtouch.com" title="support@realtouch.com">support@realtouch.com</a></p>

			<h4>Changes in this Privacy Statement</h4>

			<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement,
				the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate, so that you are aware of what information
				we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>

			<p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it
				frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email,
				or by means of a notice on our home page.</p>
