																	RealAge is committed to protecting your privacy. We have prepared this Privacy 
																	Statement to describe to you our practices regarding the Personal Data we 
																	collect from users of our services.
																	<br><br>
																	<b>A Note to Non-U.S. Users</b>
																	<br>
																	YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IN ACCORDANCE 
																	WITH THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT. YOUR PERSONAL DATA MAY BE PROCESSED IN THE UNITED 
																	STATES. UNITED STATES LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA MAY BE LESS 
																	STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY.
																	<br><br>
																	<b>A Note to California and Canada Users</b>
																	<br>
																	California and Canada residents have the right to know how their information 
																	may be shared with third parties who engage in direct marketing activities, 
																	and this Privacy Policy explains our practices and how you can opt out of 
																	having your information shared for such purposes.
																	<br><br>
																	<b>Types of Data We Collect</b>
																	<br>
                                                                    RealAge collects Personal Data, Personal Postal Data, and Anonymous Data when 
                                                                    you visit our site or when you send us information or communications. "Personal Data" 
                                                                    means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, 
                                                                    your name and e-mail address as well as any information about you that is 
                                                                    associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data. “Personal Postal Data” 
                                                                    means data that allows someone to identify or contact you via your name and 
                                                                    mailing address. "Anonymous Data" means data that is not associated with or 
                                                                    linked to your Personal Data; Anonymous Data does not permit the identification 
                                                                    of individual persons. We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data as described below.
                                                                    <br><br>
																	<b>Personal Data You Provide to Us</b>
																	<br>
																	We collect Personal Data from you, such as your name, e-mail address, country 
																	of residence, zip code or mail code, gender, and/or birth date when you 
																	register for a membership with us or when you choose to use the various 
																	services we provide on our site (e.g., Tip of the Day, Health Assessments, 
																	etc.). We also collect other types of Personal Data that you provide to us 
																	voluntarily, such as your health-related information when you respond to 
																	surveys, health assessments, and questionnaires. If you provide us feedback regarding 
																	our site or services via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address 
																	in order to send you a reply.
																	<br><br>
																	In order to improve our services to you, we may ask you to voluntarily complete 
																	confidential surveys. We do not ask you to provide us any personally 
																	identifiable data in association with these surveys, although we do associate 
																	your responses with Personal Data. If you do not wish to participate in a 
																	survey, however, simply decline to participate when asked.
																	<br><br>
																	<b>Personal Data Collected via Technology</b>
																	<br>
																	To make our services more useful to you, we use technological means to collect 
																	Personal Data from you, including the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) you just 
																	came from, the URL you go to next, your browser type, and your Internet 
																	Protocol (IP) address. We also use cookies or clear GIFs to collect Personal 
																	Data from you about your use of our site or e-mails we send you. You expressly 
																	consent to our use of cookies and clear GIFs when you use our services.
																	<br><br>
																	An "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer 
																	when you use the Internet. In some cases, your IP address stays the same from 
																	browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer Internet access 
																	provider, your IP address probably varies from session to session. We track IP 
																	addresses solely in conjunction with session cookies to analyze our Web page 
																	flow.
																	<br><br>
																	"Cookies" are small pieces of information that a Web site sends to your 
																	computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a Web site. RealAge uses both 
																	session cookies (which expire once you close your Web browser) and persistent 
																	cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with 
																	a more personal and interactive experience on our site. You have the ability to 
																	accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but 
																	you can disable this function by changing the cookie profile on your computer’s 
																	Web browser. If you disable your cookies, however, you will not have access to 
																	certain features of our site, such as "Remember My Password" or interactive 
																	quizzes. RealAge does not store any Personal Data in cookies on your computer 
																	(other than the cookie itself).
																	<br><br>
																	"Clear GIFs" are clear electronic images that are used to track your movements 
																	on our site. They help us to determine whether content on our site is 
																	effective. We also use clear GIFs in HTML-based e-mails to let us know which 
																	e-mails have been opened and acted upon by recipients (including any persons to 
																	which the e-mails have been forwarded). Clear GIFs on our sites collect only a 
																	limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page 
																	view, and a description of the page on which the clear GIF resides. This 
																	information helps us assess the effectiveness of certain communications and 
																	marketing campaigns.
																	<br><br>
																	<b>Personal Data That We Collect from You About Others</b>
																	<br>
																	If you decide to invite a friend or family member to join RealAge via a Tip of 
																	the Day, Health Assessment invitation, or other means in the future, we will 
																	collect your name and e-mail address as well as your friend’s or family 
																	member’s e-mail address in order to send this e-mail. This information is used 
																	once only and is not saved in our database, with the exception of the RealAge 
																	Challenge, in which case the friend's e-mail address is stored only for 
																	Challenge participation purposes. If you decide to invite a friend or family 
																	member to take the RealAge Test, we will collect and save the friend’s or 
																	family member’s e-mail address into our database, as we would for anyone who 
																	registers on the RealAge site.
																	<br><br>
																	<b>Personally Identifying Data Collected by Third Parties</b>
																	<br>
																	Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Privacy Statement, only RealAge collects Personally Identifying Data through the services provided solely by RealAge; this Privacy Statement applies only to the use and disclosure of Personally Identifying Data that we collect while you use our services. 
																	<br><br>
																	We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, e-mail address, or postal address) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here: (<a href="http://networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp" target="_blank"> http://networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp</a>). Furthermore, when you click on such advertisements or links, you will leave our site and go to another site. During this process, a third party (including a third-party advertising service that may provide services to an advertiser) may collect Personally Identifying Data or Anonymous Data from you, such as the URL you just came from, the URL you go to next, your browser type, and your IP address. Our display of advertisements or links to any other company or site is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such company or site (or the contents of the site). We have no control over, we do not review, and our Privacy Statement does not apply to these other companies, sites, or content, or to any collection of data after you click on an advertisement of or link to a third party. 
																	<br><br>
																	<b>Use of Your Data</b>
																	<br>
																	RealAge uses your Personal Data to provide you with a customized Web experience 
																	and to provide services to you. Such services include calculating your RealAge, 
																	processing your answers to quizzes to provide you with 
																	tailored information regarding your health, and sending electronic newsletters 
																	and promotional e-mails to you if you have requested to receive such 
																	communications from us (as described below). We also use Personal Data to 
																	notify you about updates to our services and to respond to your requests.
																	<br><br>
																	We may create Anonymous Data records from Personal Data by excluding 
																	information (such as your name) that makes the data personally identifiable to 
																	you. We use this Anonymous Data to perform statistical analyses of users’ 
																	aggregate behavior so that we may enhance the content of our services and 
																	improve site navigation. RealAge reserves the right to use and disclose 
																	Anonymous Data to third parties in its discretion.
																	<br><br>
															        If you elect to say yes to becoming a free RealAge Member (as described below), 
															        we will periodically send you free newsletters and e-mails that directly promote 
															        the use of our site(s) or the purchase of our products or services and may contain,
															        in whole or in part, advertisements for third parties which relate to marketed 
															        products of selected RealAge partners. As a benefit of becoming a member, 
															        you may receive promotional e-mail from RealAge properties such as DogAge, CatAge, 
															        and others. 
																	<br><br>
																	<b>Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Personal Postal Data</b>
																	<br>
																	Except as otherwise stated in this policy, we do not sell, trade, or rent the 
																	Personal Data collected from our services to third parties. However, we will 
																	share your Personal Data with third parties to fulfill the services that you have 
																	asked us to provide to you, including but not limited to sending you free 
																	newsletters and promotional e-mails. These third parties are required not to 
																	use your Personal Data other than to provide the services requested by RealAge. 
																	You expressly consent to the sharing of your Personal Data with our contractors 
																	and third-party service providers for the sole purpose of providing services to you. 
																	<br><br>
																	If you send a testimonial or comment to us, we may post it on our site or use 
																	it in advertising materials. We will attribute your testimonial to you by 
																	posting your first and last initial or your first name and last initial next to 
																	your testimonial on our site or advertising materials, if provided.
																	<br><br>
																	Regardless of any choices you make regarding your Personal Data (as described 
																	below), RealAge may disclose Personal Data if it believes in good faith that 
																	such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to 
																	subpoenas or warrants served on RealAge; or (b) protect or defend the rights or 
																	property of RealAge or users of RealAge services.
																	<br><br>
                                                                    RealAge is a company with either subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies 
                                                                    under a common control (collectively, "affiliates"). These affiliates include but 
                                                                    are not limited to DogAge and CatAge. We may share some or all of your Personal 
                                                                    Data and Personal Postal Data with these affiliates, in which case we will require 
                                                                    our affiliates to honor this Privacy Statement. If another company acquires our 
                                                                    company or our assets, that company will possess the Personal Data and Personal 
                                                                    Postal Data collected by it and us and will assume the rights and obligations 
                                                                    regarding your Personal Data and Personal Postal Data as described in this 
                                                                    Privacy Statement.

																	If you provide RealAge with Personal Postal Data, we may share your name and mailing 
																	address with our affiliates or other third-party businesses that offer goods or services 
																	that we believe may be of interest to our customers. Many customers appreciate the 
																	offerings they receive from such third parties; however, we allow you to opt out of 
																	having your Personal Data shared with affiliated or unaffiliated third parties for 
																	their direct marketing purposes. To submit such an opt-out request, please go to

																	<b>Security of Your Personal Data</b>
																	<br>
																	RealAge is committed to protecting the security of your Personal Data. We use a 
																	variety of industry-standard security technologies and procedures to help 
																	protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
																	<br><br>
																	On most of our sites, RealAge enables the use of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 
																	technology and Verisign Site ID, the industry leaders in providing secure 
																	communication over the Internet. SSL can be engaged by choosing to switch to 
																	SSL during any interaction in which you enter Personal Data. We also offer 
																	industry-standard secured-server transactions that encrypt your Personal Data 
																	when collecting your credit card information for online purchases. To verify 
																	that you have a secure server connection, look for the locked padlock symbol at 
																	the bottom of your browser window or the HTMLS-code in the site 
																	connection identifier.
																	<br><br>
																	RealAge has implemented other industry-standard electronic means of protecting 
																	your Personal Data. We store Personal Data behind a computer firewall, a 
																	barrier designed to prevent outsiders from accessing our servers. We also 
																	require you to enter a password to access your account information. In 
																	addition, RealAge protects your Personal Data from unauthorized physical access 
																	by storing your Personal Data in a controlled facility. Except as provided 
																	elsewhere in this Privacy Statement, RealAge limits access to Personal Data in 
																	electronic databases to those persons (including employees and contractors) in 
																	RealAge’s organization who have a business need for such access.
																	<br><br>
																	Even though RealAge has taken significant steps to ensure that your Personal 
																	Data is not intercepted, accessed, used, or disclosed by unauthorized persons, 
																	you should know that RealAge cannot eliminate security risks associated with 
																	Personal Data.
