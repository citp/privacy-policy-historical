# Privacy Policy

Reading Eagle Company and readingeagle.com strive to offer visitors to our site a personal Internet experience, and to do this, we may from time to time ask for or use information such as your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number, or certain demographic information subject to the terms of this privacy policy. This policy applies to information collected online and is not applicable to information collected or used by Reading Eagle Company or readingeagle.com through other means.

 **Requests for information.**  
The nature of the information we might collect and the way in which we gather and store it depends on the web page that you are visiting or the services or activities you select on those pages. For example, you may be asked to provide appropriate information when you register for access to certain portions of our site, participate in forums, subscribe to the newspaper, request an archive reproduction, or use certain features. No information that identifies you personally will be gathered unless you are afforded the opportunity to refuse to provide such information.  
  
 **Automatic Tracking  
** While readingeagle.com does log certain tracking information in ways transparent to visitors, this is not information that personally identifies any visitor. Examples are recording a visitor’s Internet service provider or tracking the number of pages visited. We may use cookie technology to recognize someone on a subsequent visit. You can choose not to provide us with such information by setting your browser to refuse cookies, but that may render you unable to access certain portions of the site.  
  
 **What we do with information.**  
We collect information to enhance your visit and may use it to deliver individualized content and/or advertising. We may sometimes permit advertising and/or promotional affiliates to call to your attention certain products, offers and web content. Information gathered on readingeagle.com will not be used to enable direct communications sent by our advertisers or promotional partners unless you are offered the opportunity to elect not to receive such direct communications.  
  
 **Aggregated Information.  
** Information that does not personally identify you may be used to enhance our site and services. For example, we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar information from other users to determine which pages are visited most or what features are most popular. Such information may be shared with advertisers and business affiliates, but only if it does not include any information to identify you individually.  
  
 **Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements.**  
Be aware that third parties, including our advertisers, affiliates and others whose content may be accessible through readingeagle.com may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. During your visit to our site you may link to or view certain content that is created or hosted by a third party. You should check the applicable privacy policies of those parties when providing information to them.  
  
 **Non-requested Information  
** If you voluntarily disclose information on message boards or in chat areas, that information may be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and outside the control of readingeagle.com or this policy.  
 **
