This privacy policy explains what personal information is collected, when and how it is used, disclosed and protected with respect to our web site located at www.REALITYSANDWICH.com (the \"Site\"). By using the Site, you accept the policy, even as modified by us periodically. Please carefully review this policy so you understand our data privacy practices.\r\n<P>\r\n<strong>Personal Information<\/strong>\r\n<P>\r\nPersonal information is information that specifically identifies an individual, including but not limited to, name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, or other account number, and information about that individual's activities when directly linked to that person such as information about personal use of the Site. Personal information may also include demographic information such as birth date, gender, location and personal preferences you may give us during routine use of the site. Personal information does not include \"aggregate\" information. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of products, services or customers, from which individual customer identities have been removed. In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service, but it will not include personal information through which you can be identified. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and our users' needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our Site.\r\n<P>\r\n<strong>Information We Collect<\/strong>\r\n<P>\r\nWe collect personal information in a number of ways when you visit our web site. For example, we collect personal information when you: (1) register and set up an account; (2) sign up for any of our e-mail newsletters; (3) post content on your blog; (4) join a cause or discussion group (5) create or RSVP for an event (6) invite others to join your event or cause (7) contact us by e-mail for any reason; (8) make a transaction through our site. When you visit our web site, some information is also automatically collected, such as your computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address, your computer's operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring web site, and the time and date of your visit and purchases. We treat this information as personal information if we combine it with or link it to any of the identifying information mentioned above. Otherwise, it is used in the aggregate only.\r\n<P>\r\n<strong>How We Use Collected Information<\/strong>\r\n<P>\r\nIn general, we use personal information to process your requests and provide you with service, and connect you with information, organizations, individuals, products or services we think will be of interest. When we use personal information in our marketing efforts, we provide you with options (See Control of Personal Information below) and do not disclose the information to third parties except as described in this Policy. Personal information provided online may be linked together or merged with other personal information so that we may better understand your needs and to inform you about our products or services and those of our partners. In addition, if we receive information from third parties with whom we have business relationships, we may combine this information with the other personal information we maintain about you. In either case, this Policy governs this information.\r\n<P>\r\nWe will not sell your personal information to a third party.\r\n<P>\r\n<strong>Content<\/strong>\r\n<P>\r\nWe encourage you to speak your mind, offer and share information. We believe in freedom of speech, and we believe that free speech is necessary for the productive dialogue that will improve our collective understanding of the world around us. As such, we encourage you to explore your own ideas, and those of others. You understand that anything you say on the Site is your responsibility and does not, in any way, represent the views of REALITY SANDWICH. You will be held legally responsible for your words and their presence on our site does not imply any sort of endorsement or protection of you, by us.\r\n<P>\r\nUnless otherwise selected (indicated), your blogs, comments, events and causes are displayed publicly. Your (Username) display name is automatically displayed with comments you publish, and if other members choose to, they can receive email notifications of your publications or publish their own comments to your reviews.\r\n<P>\r\nWe review all content and use it to develop aggregate ratings, personalize site views and other site features.\r\n<P>\r\n<strong>Email<\/strong>\r\n<P>\r\nIf you send emails through our site, your email will include your email address and any personal message you include. However, these emails aren't private communications. We do not retain, in any easily retrievable way, the addresses you are emailing. You may not use these tools to send spam or content that violates the user agreement.\r\n<P>\r\nYou may not harvest personal data (including email addresses) from the site, and specifically you may not use email addresses displayed on the site to ask users to join or contribute to your services. (solicitation, commercial purposes\u2026)\r\n<P>\r\n<strong>Security<\/strong>\r\n<P>\r\nWe have put into place reasonable security measures in an effort to protect personal information while it is under our control. Your account information is accessible online only through the use of a password. To protect the confidentiality of personal information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You are responsible for all uses of our web site by any person using your password. Please advise us immediately if you believe your password has been misused.\r\n<P>\r\nWe work to protect the security of your information by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. If transactions are processed on the website, transaction information is transmitted to and from the website in encrypted form using industry-standard SSL connections to help protect such information from interception. Using this encryption, we transmit an entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing, but reveal only the last four digits of credit card numbers when confirming an order. We restrict authorized access to personal information to those persons who have a legitimate need to know that information to provide products or services to you and those persons you have authorized to have access to such information.\r\n<P>\r\nREALITY SANDWICH follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once REALITY SANDWICH receives it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while REALITY SANDWICH strives to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.\r\n<P>\r\n<strong>Control Of Your Information<\/strong>\r\n<P>\r\nWe give you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us and to view, correct or delete your personal information.\r\n<P>\r\nIf you do not want to receive e-mail from us, you can; (a) alter your preferences accordingly; or (b) follow the opt-out instructions at the bottom of any email you receive from us.\r\n<P>\r\nIf you want to view, correct or delete your personal information, you can access your information online by clicking the \"PROFILE\" link.\r\n<P>\r\nWe may share personal information with third-party vendors who assist us in performing functions necessary to operate our business. These functions may include, without limitation, Website hosting, credit card transaction processing and data entry. We limit the information shared with our third-party vendors to that which we believe is necessary to carry out those functions. Moreover, we require them to comply with our privacy practices, and not to use the information for other purposes except as required by law. We are not responsible for any failure on their part to comply with our privacy practices, nor are we responsible for any additional information you provide directly to these parties, and we encourage you to become familiar with their practices before disclosing information directly to them.\r\n<P>\r\nIn addition, we may disclose personal information in the good faith belief that we are lawfully authorized to do so, or that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process or authorities, respond to any claims, or to protect the rights, property or personal safety of REALITY SANDWICH, our users, our employees or the public. Information about our users, including personal information, may be disclosed or transferred as part of, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets or acquisition. Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personal information when posting reviews or other content to the Site, this information may be collected and used by others. You agree that we shall bear no responsibility for any such disclosures. We recommend you be cautious in giving out personal information to others in public online forums.\r\n<P>\r\nLastly, if any law enforcement agency approaches REALITY SANDWICH with appropriate documents that show reason to believe you are using the REALITY SANDWICH site to commit a crime, we will cooperate and give them your information.\r\n<P>\r\n<strong>Cookies<\/strong>\r\n<P>\r\nCookies: Cookies are small text files placed on your hard drive by a web site when you visit. These files identify your computer and record your preferences and other data about your visit so that when you return to the site, the site knows who you are and can personalize your visit. In general, we use cookies to collect information so that we can determine how to improve our sites by seeing which areas and features are most popular; to personalize the site, to improve the site experience and to complete transactions you have requested. Most browsers automatically accept cookies as the default setting. You can modify the setting to reject cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the sites you visit by editing browser options. If you decide not to accept our cookies, you will still be able to access those parts of our site available to the general public but you may not be able to use some of the site's features or services and you may have a less satisfactory experience.\r\n<P>\r\n<strong>USE OF OUR WEBSITE BY CHILDREN<\/strong>\r\n<P>\r\nWe encourage parents to take an active interest in their children's use of the Internet. We do not intend to collect information from children who are under 13 years of age. If you are under 13 you should not provide information on our web site.\r\n<P>\r\n<strong>LINKS TO OTHER SITES<\/strong>\r\n<P>\r\nOur web site contains links to other web sites. Any personal information you provide on the linked pages is provided directly to that third party and is subject to that third party's privacy policy. Except as described above, we are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of web sites to which we link. Links from our web site to third parties or to other sites are provided for your convenience. We encourage you to learn about their privacy and security practices and policies before providing them with personal information.\r\n<P>\r\n<strong>COMMENTS OR CONCERNS<\/strong>\r\n<P>\r\nWe welcome your feedback. If you have any comments or concerns about this privacy policy or would like to contact us for any reason, you may reach us at admin@realitysandwich.com.\r\n<P>\r\n<strong>DATA CHANGES<\/strong>\r\n<P>\r\nIf you terminate your account or delete\/change your data or content, we usually update our live databases immediately. However, some data may update more slowly, and some old data may remain in our archives and records. Also, we may be unable to propagate changes to partners who receive your data or content. If your account is being terminated or suspended, we may maintain some data to prevent re-registration.\r\n<P>\r\n<strong>POLICY CHANGES<\/strong>\r\n<P>\r\nWe may amend our Privacy Policy at any time, without notice to you, by posting such revised Privacy Policy on this page, so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it. Any changes will only apply to information collected after the change is posted. You are responsible for checking any and all changes to the privacy policy agreement if in fact it is amended.\r\n<P>","post_title":"Privacy","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"privacy","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2013-11-26 16:12:48","post_modified_gmt":"2013-11-26 16:12:48","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":200037,"guid":"http:\/\/staging.realitysandwich.com\/?page_id=214448","menu_order":0,"post_type":"page","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"}},"user":0,"displayed_user":{"user_id":0,"display_name":null,"first_name":null},"security":{"mode":"user"},"site_info":{"name":"Reality Sandwich","description":"You are what you eat."},"post_types":{"feature":"Longform","blog":"Blog","link":"Link","announcement":"Announcement","event":"Event","block":"Ad Blocks","forum":"Forum","discussion":"Discussion"},"paths":{"ajax_url":"http:\/\/realitysandwich.com\/wp-admin\/admin-ajax.php","plugins_url":"http:\/\/realitysandwich.com\/wp-content\/plugins","plugins_dir":"\/var\/www\/vhosts\/realitysandwich.com\/httpdocs\/wp-content\/plugins","theme_dir":"\/var\/www\/vhosts\/realitysandwich.com\/httpdocs\/wp-content\/themes\/RSV2","home_url":"http:\/\/realitysandwich.com","wp_url":"http:\/\/realitysandwich.com","stylesheet_directory":"http:\/\/realitysandwich.com\/wp-content\/themes\/RSV2","template_url":"http:\/\/realitysandwich.com\/wp-content\/themes\/RSV2","postworld_url":"http:\/\/realitysandwich.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/postworld","postworld_dir":"\/var\/www\/vhosts\/realitysandwich.com\/httpdocs\/wp-content\/plugins\/postworld"},"language":null,"inject":["wp-less","icomoon"]};

	<!-- TITLE -->
	<h1>Privacy</h1>
		<div class="post_content"><p></p><br>
<p><br>
REALITY SANDWICH is committed to protecting the private information that our users give us. This privacy policy explains what personal information is collected, when and how it is used, disclosed and protected with respect to our web site located at www.REALITYSANDWICH.com (the “Site”). By using the Site, you accept the policy, even as modified by us periodically. Please carefully review this policy so you understand our data privacy practices.<br>
</p><p><br>
<strong>Personal Information</strong><br>
</p><p><br>
Personal information is information that specifically identifies an individual, including but not limited to, name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, or other account number, and information about that individual’s activities when directly linked to that person such as information about personal use of the Site. Personal information may also include demographic information such as birth date, gender, location and personal preferences you may give us during routine use of the site. Personal information does not include “aggregate” information. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of products, services or customers, from which individual customer identities have been removed. In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service, but it will not include personal information through which you can be identified. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and our users’ needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our Site.<br>
</p><p><br>
<strong>Information We Collect</strong><br>
</p><p><br>
We collect personal information in a number of ways when you visit our web site. For example, we collect personal information when you: (1) register and set up an account; (2) sign up for any of our e-mail newsletters; (3) post content on your blog; (4) join a cause or discussion group (5) create or RSVP for an event (6) invite others to join your event or cause (7) contact us by e-mail for any reason; (8) make a transaction through our site. When you visit our web site, some information is also automatically collected, such as your computer’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, your computer’s operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring web site, and the time and date of your visit and purchases. We treat this information as personal information if we combine it with or link it to any of the identifying information mentioned above. Otherwise, it is used in the aggregate only.<br>
</p><p><br>
<strong>How We Use Collected Information</strong><br>
</p><p><br>
In general, we use personal information to process your requests and provide you with service, and connect you with information, organizations, individuals, products or services we think will be of interest. When we use personal information in our marketing efforts, we provide you with options (See Control of Personal Information below) and do not disclose the information to third parties except as described in this Policy. Personal information provided online may be linked together or merged with other personal information so that we may better understand your needs and to inform you about our products or services and those of our partners. In addition, if we receive information from third parties with whom we have business relationships, we may combine this information with the other personal information we maintain about you. In either case, this Policy governs this information.<br>
</p><p><br>
We will not sell your personal information to a third party.<br>
</p><p><br>
<strong>Content</strong><br>
</p><p><br>
We encourage you to speak your mind, offer and share information. We believe in freedom of speech, and we believe that free speech is necessary for the productive dialogue that will improve our collective understanding of the world around us. As such, we encourage you to explore your own ideas, and those of others. You understand that anything you say on the Site is your responsibility and does not, in any way, represent the views of REALITY SANDWICH. You will be held legally responsible for your words and their presence on our site does not imply any sort of endorsement or protection of you, by us.<br>
</p><p><br>
Unless otherwise selected (indicated), your blogs, comments, events and causes are displayed publicly. Your (Username) display name is automatically displayed with comments you publish, and if other members choose to, they can receive email notifications of your publications or publish their own comments to your reviews.<br>
</p><p><br>
We review all content and use it to develop aggregate ratings, personalize site views and other site features.<br>
</p><p><br>
<strong>Email</strong><br>
</p><p><br>
If you send emails through our site, your email will include your email address and any personal message you include. However, these emails aren’t private communications. We do not retain, in any easily retrievable way, the addresses you are emailing. You may not use these tools to send spam or content that violates the user agreement.<br>
</p><p><br>
You may not harvest personal data (including email addresses) from the site, and specifically you may not use email addresses displayed on the site to ask users to join or contribute to your services. (solicitation, commercial purposes…)<br>
</p><p><br>
<strong>Security</strong><br>
</p><p><br>
We have put into place reasonable security measures in an effort to protect personal information while it is under our control. Your account information is accessible online only through the use of a password. To protect the confidentiality of personal information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You are responsible for all uses of our web site by any person using your password. Please advise us immediately if you believe your password has been misused.<br>
</p><p><br>
We work to protect the security of your information by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. If transactions are processed on the website, transaction information is transmitted to and from the website in encrypted form using industry-standard SSL connections to help protect such information from interception. Using this encryption, we transmit an entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing, but reveal only the last four digits of credit card numbers when confirming an order. We restrict authorized access to personal information to those persons who have a legitimate need to know that information to provide products or services to you and those persons you have authorized to have access to such information.<br>
</p><p><br>
REALITY SANDWICH follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once REALITY SANDWICH receives it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while REALITY SANDWICH strives to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.<br>
</p><p><br>
<strong>Control Of Your Information</strong><br>
</p><p><br>
We give you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us and to view, correct or delete your personal information.<br>
</p><p><br>
If you do not want to receive e-mail from us, you can; (a) alter your preferences accordingly; or (b) follow the opt-out instructions at the bottom of any email you receive from us.<br>
</p><p><br>
If you want to view, correct or delete your personal information, you can access your information online by clicking the “PROFILE” link.<br>
</p><p><br>
We may share personal information with third-party vendors who assist us in performing functions necessary to operate our business. These functions may include, without limitation, Website hosting, credit card transaction processing and data entry. We limit the information shared with our third-party vendors to that which we believe is necessary to carry out those functions. Moreover, we require them to comply with our privacy practices, and not to use the information for other purposes except as required by law. We are not responsible for any failure on their part to comply with our privacy practices, nor are we responsible for any additional information you provide directly to these parties, and we encourage you to become familiar with their practices before disclosing information directly to them.<br>
</p><p><br>
In addition, we may disclose personal information in the good faith belief that we are lawfully authorized to do so, or that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process or authorities, respond to any claims, or to protect the rights, property or personal safety of REALITY SANDWICH, our users, our employees or the public. Information about our users, including personal information, may be disclosed or transferred as part of, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets or acquisition. Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personal information when posting reviews or other content to the Site, this information may be collected and used by others. You agree that we shall bear no responsibility for any such disclosures. We recommend you be cautious in giving out personal information to others in public online forums.<br>
</p><p><br>
Lastly, if any law enforcement agency approaches REALITY SANDWICH with appropriate documents that show reason to believe you are using the REALITY SANDWICH site to commit a crime, we will cooperate and give them your information.<br>
</p><p><br>
<strong>Cookies</strong><br>
</p><p><br>
Cookies: Cookies are small text files placed on your hard drive by a web site when you visit. These files identify your computer and record your preferences and other data about your visit so that when you return to the site, the site knows who you are and can personalize your visit. In general, we use cookies to collect information so that we can determine how to improve our sites by seeing which areas and features are most popular; to personalize the site, to improve the site experience and to complete transactions you have requested. Most browsers automatically accept cookies as the default setting. You can modify the setting to reject cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the sites you visit by editing browser options. If you decide not to accept our cookies, you will still be able to access those parts of our site available to the general public but you may not be able to use some of the site’s features or services and you may have a less satisfactory experience.<br>
</p><p><br>
<strong>USE OF OUR WEBSITE BY CHILDREN</strong><br>
</p><p><br>
We encourage parents to take an active interest in their children’s use of the Internet. We do not intend to collect information from children who are under 13 years of age. If you are under 13 you should not provide information on our web site.<br>
</p><p><br>
<strong>LINKS TO OTHER SITES</strong><br>
</p><p><br>
Our web site contains links to other web sites. Any personal information you provide on the linked pages is provided directly to that third party and is subject to that third party’s privacy policy. Except as described above, we are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of web sites to which we link. Links from our web site to third parties or to other sites are provided for your convenience. We encourage you to learn about their privacy and security practices and policies before providing them with personal information.<br>

</p><p><br>
<strong>DATA CHANGES</strong><br>
</p><p><br>
If you terminate your account or delete/change your data or content, we usually update our live databases immediately. However, some data may update more slowly, and some old data may remain in our archives and records. Also, we may be unable to propagate changes to partners who receive your data or content. If your account is being terminated or suspended, we may maintain some data to prevent re-registration.<br>
</p><p><br>
<strong>POLICY CHANGES</strong><br>
</p><p><br>
We may amend our Privacy Policy at any time, without notice to you, by posting such revised Privacy Policy on this page, so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it. Any changes will only apply to information collected after the change is posted. You are responsible for checking any and all changes to the privacy policy agreement if in fact it is amended.<br>
