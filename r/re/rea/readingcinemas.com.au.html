    <p class="pagebody">Reading Entertainment Australia Pty Limited ACN 070 893 
      908 and its related entities (Reading) are committed to preserving your 
      privacy, and this Privacy Statement reflects our firm commitment to you. 
      It sets out our policies in relation to the way we collect and handle personal 
      information. We encourage you to check our privacy statement regularly as 
      this Privacy Statement may change from time to time.</p>
    <p class="pagebody"><strong>1. HOW AND WHY WE COLLECT INFORMATION</strong><br>
      We collect personal information from you in a variety of ways. For example, 
      we may collect personal information from you by one of the following means:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="pagebody"> competition entry forms; </li>
      <li class="pagebody"> membership and subscription forms; </li>
      <li class="pagebody">email or SMS; </li>
      <li class="pagebody">when you visit our website; </li>
      <li class="pagebody"> online transactions; </li>
      <li class="pagebody">when you join our loyalty program;</li>
      <li class="pagebody"> credit card details via credit card purchases; and 
      </li>
      <li class="pagebody">information collected from third parties.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> <span class="pagebody"><strong>Information provided by you</strong><br>
      You provide most of the personal information directly to us and for a specific 
      purpose. </span></p>
    <p class="pagebody">For example, we collect personal contact information (such 
      as your name, address, email address and phone number) when you participate 
      in contests, competitions or register onto our website. </p>
    <p class="pagebody">We may also collect personal information when you visit 
      certain parts of our website and provide content, feedback or suggestions. 
      You may also participate in interactive online activities such as games, 
      chat or bulletin boards or by voting in polls. If you register onto our 
      website, we may also collect information on your use of the site so that 
      we can make our website as interesting as possible for you.</p>
    <p class="pagebody">When you join our loyalty program, you will be asked to 
      provide information relating to your movie going habits. Each time you use 
      your loyalty program card, information will be collected about the movies 
      that you see. This will help assist us to learn more about the type of movies 
      that you like. </p>
    <p class="pagebody">We may also give you the opportunity to be contacted by 
      email or SMS so that we can offer you discount and promotional opportunities. 
    </p>
    <p class="pagebody">We collect financial information (such as credit card 
      information) from you in order to receive payment from you for products 
      and services which you order.</p>
    <p class="pagebody"><strong>Competitions</strong></p>
    <p class="pagebody">From time to time, we conduct competitions and give you 
      the choice of receiving further contact from us. Unless you make the choice 
      for us to contact you further, the personal information which we collect 
      from your entry into the competition will not be used for any purpose other 
      than for the competition. </p>
    <p class="pagebody"><strong>Information provided by "cookies" technology</strong></p>
    <p class="pagebody">When you visit our web site, "cookies" technology 
      allows us to identify your movements around our site. This information provides 
      us with constructive feedback about our site so that we can identify the 
      most effective areas and improve the less popular ones. </p>
    <p class="pagebody">Cookies alone cannot determine the identity of individual 
      users. It is a feature of your Internet browser which you can disable at 
      any time. </p>
    <p></p>
    <p class="pagebody"><span class="smallbody"> A 'cookie' is a small data file 
      that resides on your computer's hard drive. Some web sites write to this 
      file when you visit them.<br>

      The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply 
      yourself</span>.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p class="pagebody"><strong>Sensitive Information</strong></p>
    <p class="pagebody">We do not collect any information about your racial or 
      ethnic origin, political opinions or membership, religious or philosophical 
      beliefs, trade association or union membership, sexual preferences or criminal 
      record, unless:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="pagebody"> you have given us specific consent to do so, or</li>
      <li class="pagebody"> where we are required by law to do so, or</li>
      <li class="pagebody"> it is necessary to prevent a serious and imminent 
        threat to the life or health of a person, or</li>
      <li class="pagebody"> it is necessary for the establishment, exercise or 
        defence of a legal claim.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> <span class="pagebody"><strong>2. HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></span></p>
    <p class="pagebody"><br>
      We use personal information primarily for the purpose for which it was collected. 
      Because most of our information is collected from you directly, you will 
      normally be aware of the purpose of the collection. For example, information 
      may be collected from you so that we can fulfil prizes, offer discounts 
      and process online transactions.</p>
    <p class="pagebody">In relation to our loyalty program, information we collect 
      may be used to invite loyalty program members to special screenings and 
      events as well as to make special ticket and promotional offers.</p>
    <p class="pagebody"><strong>Use of the information for a secondary purpose</strong></p>
    <p class="pagebody">We may sometimes use the personal information we collect 
      for a secondary purpose, that is, for use in a way different from the original 
      reason for collection. We will only do this in the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="pagebody"> where you have consented,</li>
      <li class="pagebody"> where the secondary purpose is directly related to 
        the primary purpose, and you would reasonably expect us to use or disclose 
        the information in such a way, or</li>
      <li class="pagebody"> where we are permitted or required by law, or it is 
        in the interests of public safety to do so.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="pagebody"> For example, we may use your contact details for editorial 
      and feedback purposes or to inform you of our products and services. We 
      may also collect personal information so that we can provide information 
      which is of interest to you. You are always given the opportunity to notify 
      us that you do not wish to receive this material.</p>
    <p class="pagebody"><strong>Disclosure of the information we collect</strong></p>
    <p class="pagebody">We treat personal information which we collect from you 
      in the same way that we treat our other confidential information. We will 
      not sell to anyone, the information which we collect about you.<br>
      We will not disclose to a third party, the information which we collect 
      about you, except where it is necessary to conduct our business, and then 
      only if the third party:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="pagebody"> first enters into appropriate confidentiality undertakings 
        with us, or</li>
      <li class="pagebody"> has a privacy policy which is similar to ours.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="pagebody"><br>
      <strong>3. HOW WE PROTECT OUR INFORMATION COLLECTION</strong></p>
    <p class="pagebody"><br>
      We will take all reasonable steps to ensure the security of all personal 
      information we collect. This involves protecting it from misuse and loss, 
      as well as from modification and disclosure.</p>
    <p class="pagebody">The inherent nature of the Internet means that the security 
      of any transmission of information to us using the Internet cannot be guaranteed.</p>
    <p class="pagebody">The electronic databases that hold information as well 
      as our internal systems are designed to restrict access to only those people 
      who require specific information.</p>
    <p class="pagebody">In addition, your personal information is only kept while 
      it is required for the purpose for which it was collected or for a permitted 
      secondary purpose. Reading regularly deletes and de-identifies personal 
      information if we no longer need the information.</p>
    <p class="pagebody"><br>
      <strong>4. YOUR ABILITY TO ACCESS AND CORRECT INFORMATION</strong></p>
    <p class="pagebody"><br>
      We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information 
      which we collect, use or disclose is accurate, complete and up-to-date.</p>
    <p class="pagebody">If you wish to access the information we hold about you, 
      you are welcome to contact us and we will respond to your request within 
      45 days. A handling fee may be payable so that we can obtain the information 
      you require.</p>
    <p class="pagebody"><strong>Correcting information</strong></p>
    <p class="pagebody">You can also request that information about you be corrected 
      or deleted. This is part of our commitment to take all reasonable steps 
      to ensure that the information we hold is accurate, complete and up-to-date. 
    </p>
    <p class="pagebody"><strong>Right to refuse access or correction</strong></p>
    <p class="pagebody">We reserve our right to refuse your request for access 
      or correction if, for example, we consider your request to be frivolous 
      or vexatious, or if we are legally entitled to do so. </p>
    <p class="pagebody">If we refuse your request, we will give you our reasons. 
      If we refuse your request to correct information we hold about you, we will 
      give you the opportunity to post a statement of your claim where we hold 
      your personal information.</p>
    <p class="pagebody"><strong><br>
