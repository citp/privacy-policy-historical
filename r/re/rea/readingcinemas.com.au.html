											<p><strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
<p>Reading Entertainment Australia Pty Limited ABN 12070893908 and Australia Country Cinemas Pty Ltd ABN 99076276349, and its related entities (Reading), are committed to preserving your privacy, and  this Privacy Statement reflects our firm commitment to you. It sets out  our policies in relation to the way we collect and handle personal  information. We encourage you to check our privacy statement regularly  as this Privacy Statement may change from time to time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1. HOW AND WHY WE COLLECT INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>We collect personal information from you in a variety of ways. For  example, we may collect personal information from you by one of the  following means:</p>
<ul>
<li> competition entry forms;</li>
<li> membership and subscription forms;</li>
<li> email or SMS;</li>
<li> when you visit our website;</li>
<li> online transactions;</li>
<li> when you join our loyalty program;</li>
<li> credit card details via credit card purchases; and</li>
<li> information collected from third parties. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Information provided by you</em></p>
<p><em><br></em></p>
<p>You provide most of the personal information directly to us and for a specific purpose.</p>
<p>For example, we collect personal contact information (such as your  name, address, email address and phone number) when you participate in  contests, competitions or register onto our website.</p>
<p>We may also collect personal information when you visit certain parts  of our website and provide content, feedback or suggestions. You may  also participate in interactive online activities such as games, chat or  bulletin boards or by voting in polls. If you register onto our  website, we may also collect information on your use of the site so that  we can make our website as interesting as possible for you.</p>
<p>When you join our loyalty program, you will be asked to provide  information relating to your movie going habits. Each time you use your  loyalty program card, information will be collected about the movies  that you see. This will help assist us to learn more about the type of  movies that you like.</p>
<p>We may also give you the opportunity to be contacted by email or SMS  so that we can offer you discount and promotional opportunities.</p>
<p>We collect financial information (such as credit card information)  from you in order to receive payment from you for products and services  which you order.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Competitions</em></p>
<p><em><br></em></p>
<p>From time to time, we conduct competitions and give you the choice of  receiving further contact from us. Unless you make the choice for us to  contact you further, the personal information which we collect from  your entry into the competition will not be used for any purpose other  than for the competition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Information provided by "cookies" technology</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you visit our web site, "cookies" technology allows us to  identify your movements around our site. This information provides us  with constructive feedback about our site so that we can identify the  most effective areas and improve the less popular ones.</p>
<p>Cookies alone cannot determine the identity of individual users. It  is a feature of your Internet browser which you can disable at any time.</p>
<p>A 'cookie' is a small data file that resides on your computer's hard  drive. Some web sites write to this file when you visit them.</p>
<p>A cookie file can contain information such as your user ID in order  to track the pages you have visited. A cookie cannot access other  information from your hard drive, or from cookies created by other web  sites. Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to find out the identity  of any user.</p>
<p>The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Sensitive Information</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We do not collect any information about your racial or ethnic origin,  political opinions or membership, religious or philosophical beliefs,  trade association or union membership, sexual preferences or criminal  record, unless:</p>
<ul>
<li> you have given us specific consent to do so, or </li>
<li> where we are required by law to do so, or </li>
<li> it is necessary to prevent a serious and imminent threat to the life or health of a person, or </li>
<li> it is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of a legal claim. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></p>
<p>We use personal information primarily for the purpose for which it  was collected. Because most of our information is collected from you  directly, you will normally be aware of the purpose of the collection.  For example, information may be collected from you so that we can fulfil  prizes, offer discounts and process online transactions.</p>
<p>In relation to our loyalty program, information we collect may be  used to invite loyalty program members to special screenings and events  as well as to make special ticket and promotional offers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Use of the information for a secondary purpose</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may sometimes use the personal information we collect for a  secondary purpose, that is, for use in a way different from the original  reason for collection. We will only do this in the following  circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li> where you have consented,</li>
<li> where the secondary purpose is directly related to the primary purpose, and you would<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reasonably expect us to use or disclose the information in such a way, or</li>
<li> where we are permitted or required by law, or it is in the interests of public safety to do so. </li>
</ul>
<p>For example, we may use your contact details for editorial and  feedback purposes or to inform you of our products and services. We may  also collect personal information so that we can provide information  which is of interest to you. You are always given the opportunity to  notify us that you do not wish to receive this material.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Disclosure of the information we collect</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We treat personal information which we collect from you in the same  way that we treat our other confidential information. We will not sell  to anyone, the information which we collect about you.</p>
<p>We will not disclose to a third party, the information which we  collect about you, except where it is necessary to conduct our business,  and then only if the third party:</p>
<ul>
<li> first enters into appropriate confidentiality undertakings with us, or</li>
<li> has a privacy policy which is similar to ours. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. HOW WE PROTECT OUR INFORMATION COLLECTION</strong></p>
<p>We will take all reasonable steps to ensure the security of all  personal information we collect. This involves protecting it from misuse  and loss, as well as from modification and disclosure.</p>
<p>The inherent nature of the Internet means that the security of any  transmission of information to us using the Internet cannot be  guaranteed.</p>
<p>The electronic databases that hold information as well as our  internal systems are designed to restrict access to only those people  who require specific information.</p>
<p>In addition, your personal information is only kept while it is  required for the purpose for which it was collected or for a permitted  secondary purpose. Reading regularly deletes and de-identifies personal  information if we no longer need the information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. YOUR ABILITY TO ACCESS AND CORRECT INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your personal  information which we collect, use or disclose is accurate, complete and  up-to-date.</p>
<p>If you wish to access the information we hold about you, you are  welcome to contact us and we will respond to your request within 45  days. A handling fee may be payable so that we can obtain the  information you require.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Correcting information</em></p>
<p>You can also request that information about you be corrected or  deleted. This is part of our commitment to take all reasonable steps to  ensure that the information we hold is accurate, complete and  up-to-date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Right to refuse access or correction</em></p>
<p>We reserve our right to refuse your request for access or correction  if, for example, we consider your request to be frivolous or vexatious,  or if we are legally entitled to do so.</p>
<p>If we refuse your request, we will give you our reasons. If we refuse  your request to correct information we hold about you, we will give you  the opportunity to post a statement of your claim where we hold your  personal information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5. LINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES</strong></p>
<p>Our web site contains links to other sites. We cannot be responsible  for the privacy practices of other web sites and their operators.</p>
<p>The only web site that this Privacy Statement relates to is www.readingcinemas.com.au.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6. UPDATING OUR PRIVACY STATEMENT</strong></p>
<p>As Reading grows and changes, we may revise our privacy statement. We  will keep you updated on these changes by posting new versions of our  policy on our web site.</p>
<p>By providing your personal information to us or by using our web site, you are indicating your acceptance of our current policy.</p>
