We may share some of this information for our own research purposes with our professional advisors or consultants and third party partners. However the shared information will be limited to non-personally identifying demographic information shared under cover of a confidentiality agreement. We will only use this information in the course of providing our service to you.

###  HOW WILL THIS INFORMATION BE USED AND WHO HAS ACCESS TO IT? 

If you choose to have them sent to you, we may use your contact information to send you valuable updates and timely notices of promotions and mailbox status reports. Our site provides you with the opportunity to opt-in to receiving different types of communications from us at the point where we request registration information. You may modify this choice at any time by clicking on "UNSUBSCRIBE" button at the right side of NEWSLETTER box available at almost any page of the website. We reserve the right to use your contact information at any time to advise you of any updates that may materially affect your rights or status on our site. 

Your non-personally identifying demographic information is used to personalize your experience, allow other members to find you through a search, to compose your personal profile - which is associated with a pseudonymous identity you have created (username). Your contact information are available to other members only if you pre-set this options, otherwise our default setting will allow other users to see your contact information only, without demographic characteristics. Non-registered users (visitors) are not able to see your contact information or to contact you through Private Messaging system until they subscribe and become a valid REALPOOR.COM community member. In the event that you decide to buy one of our products or services, you will be asked for your financial information (like credit card number) which cannot be read by others when you initiate your order through a secured system. You will know you are in secure mode when the tiny padlock icon - located at the bottom of your browser - appears "locked". We are using CLICKBANK & PAYPAL for billing purposes. They pledge that the information you enter will not be shared with any outside party without your expressed consent (does not include fraud cases) and that any emails you receive from them will be related to your order. However, either CLICKBANK or PAYPAL are not the owner for this services, it's just a partner and billing processor. The personally identifiable information we collect from you is used for internet review and to improve the content and functionality of our web server or customize the layout of our pages for each individual member. The specific information we collect is not shared with other organizations and we will never release your personally identifiable information to an external organization without your prior consent except for the purposes of validating credit information and collecting debts. We may disclose your personally identifiable information if we reasonably believe we are required to do so by operation of law, which may include, but is not limited to a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on REALPOOR.COM.

###  HOW LONG DO YOU KEEP THE INFORMATION I'VE GIVEN YOU? 

We keep the information you have given us for as long as you are a member on the site or for as long as we are required to do so by law, which ever is longer. 

###  CAN I CHANGE THE INFORMATION I HAVE ALREADY GIVEN YOU? 

You can always verify or request the removal of the personally identifiable information we have collected and change your registration information by selecting "Profile" from the main menu on the site. 

###  DO YOU MONITOR ONLINE BEHAVIOR? 

This is a community site where the members communicate to share the information using our forums. Also our members communicate with each other through instant private messages. We do not, as a rule, monitor members' private message exchanges, but we reserve the right to do so if user is using our service for the purpose of solicitation or any other violation of our Terms of Use or Privacy Act. Member submissions that appear on the public area of the site are moderated and, if necessary, we reserve the right to edit, delete, remove or not use any communication on a public area of the site. 

Members may choose to participate in community polls. The results of these polls do not reveal any personal identifiable information linked to the individual voters. 

###  WHAT SECURITY FEATURES DO YOU HAVE? 

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, our payment processors encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). SSL is the leading security protocol on the Internet. It ensures that information being transferred over the network is private through a process called encryption. Once encrypted the information is an unintelligible code until it is decoded upon arrival at the authorized destination. 

REALPOOR.COM follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

###  ADVERTISERS 

REALPOOR.COM uses third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. 

All information about Advertisements and Advertising on RealPoor.com is strictly defined in [Advertising Policy](http://www.realpoor.com/polices/advertising_policy.php). 

###  IMPORTANT NOTICE FOR TRADERS 

When using REALPOOR.COM for trade of virtual items, we strongly suggest not entering details that might compromise your game status. This is particularly concerning trading of game accounts, where members should not post account name in public, because it could lead to suspension or ban from the game.
