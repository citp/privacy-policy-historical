You may interact with REAL Watersports in person or through its website in numerous ways, including, but not limited to, contacting us via telephone, mail, facsimile or e-mail, placing an order via our website, downloading images or text from our website, participating in contests, voting in on-line polls, etc. REAL Watersports may collect certain personally-identifiable information during these types of interactions including, but not limited to, your name, address(es), e-mail address, telephone number(s) and credit card information. REAL Watersports assures you that it will use your personally-identifiable information only to fulfill your orders, respond to your inquiries or provide you with information. Moreover, REAL Watersports requires that its agents and affiliates who have access to your personally-identifiable information protect this information according to this privacy policy; that is, they may not use any personally-identifiable information that you may provide for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for REAL Watersports. REAL Watersports may disclose, however, your personally-identifiable information in response to certain legal processes, e.g., a court order, subpoena or law enforcement agency’s request.

REAL Watersports uses several of the latest encryption technologies to ensure the privacy and security of your on-line purchases. Your personally-identifiable information, including your credit card information, is encrypted for maximum security, and your credit card and billing information cannot be revealed to a third-party as it is transmitted to our ordering system, or to anyone attempting to access REAL Watersports’s website remotely.
