# Real Living Real Estate: Privacy Policy | Real Living Real Estate

**Our Commitment to Privacy**

You take your privacy seriously and so does Real Living Real Estate. We are a company committed to protecting the personal information and privacy of our customers. This statement is one way of sustaining your trust in our company, our products and our services.

Our Online Privacy Statement describes how we collect, protect and use information about you during your visit to our web sites.  Our web sites also contain hyperlinks to web sites operated by parties other than Real Living Real Estate, LLC or its affiliates.  

These other parties include independently owned and operated Real Living franchise offices and their sales associates and service providers who have a relationship with us.  This privacy policy is applicable only when you are on our web sites.  Once linked to another party’s web site, you should read that site's privacy policy before disclosing any personal information.

**Information We Collect and How We Use It**

When you browse our site, we may collect and store information about your online visit. 

We also collect and store information you may voluntarily provide to us, such as if you provide it to us on the “Contact Us” page of this web site.

We may collect and subsequently share personal information about you to: 

  * run our everyday business; 
  * respond quickly to customer needs; 
  * help us communicate with you; 



We do not sell or rent personally identifiable information to third parties.  We may disclose personally identifiable information to our affiliates or to third parties only to the extent necessary to respond to a specific request made by you.  We also may disclose personally identifiable information as may be required by law.

**Cookies**  
We may collect anonymous information about you. This means that the information collected cannot be traced back to a specific person. For example, our Web servers may record certain information automatically when you visit our websites. This information may include the time and length of your visit, the pages you view on our site, the last site you visited before coming to ours, and the name of your internet service provider. This anonymous information is used for research and analytical purposes only (like evaluating how many visitors our Web sites receive or which pages they visit most often). It does not reveal any personal information about you, the user. This aggregate data may be disclosed to third parties, but never with personally identifying information. 

"Cookies" are small text files that contain a unique identification number that allows our computers to identify your Web browser (but not you) each time you visit one of our Web sites that uses cookies. The information helps us improve the functionality of the site and enhance the navigation and security of your session. Most major Web sites use this technology and most browsers are set up to accept them.

You may configure your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, and you may refuse to accept them entirely. However, if you refuse to accept cookies, you may limit the functionality that we can provide to you when you visit our site.

**Passwords**  
Your access to certain portions of our Web site may be protected with an individualized username and password. Your username and password are confidential and personal to you, and should never be disclosed or shared with anyone else.

 **Your acceptance of these terms**

 By using this site, you signify your agreement to Real Living’s Privacy Policy. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS SITE. Your continued use of Real Living and/or its affiliates’ sites following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.
