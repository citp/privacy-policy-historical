##### What is the Really Good Stuff® Privacy Policy?

**What goes on at Really Good Stuff® stays at Really Good Stuff®**. 

As a teaching professional, you know how important it is to keep your students' ongoing work and personal development confidential. We feel the same way about your relationship with us. What you order, your method of payment and shipping/contact information are completely private. In fact, if you look at the bottom of our website, you will see a Norton Secured logo. This is a company we've hired to protect your private information. Technically, we use what is called the Secure Socket Layer Protocol to ensure that all of your transactions on our website are extremely safe. That means when you place an order online, the information is encrypted to ensure confidentiality. 

**Forget an apple for the teacher. We use cookies.**

Most websites use what is known as a 'cookie', which is a small data file that resides on the hard drive of your computer. It maintains information that you have given us, such as orders, shipping and credit card details from your prior visits to our site. We use this information: 

  * To identify you when you revisit our site and eliminate the need for you to reenter this information when you place another order. 
  * To keep track of your shopping cart information. 
  * To communicate with you regarding your orders and other matters regarding transactions between us. 
  * To share information about Really Good Stuff® products and services that may be of interest to you. You may opt-out of receiving such promotional messages from us at any time. If we do send you a promotional email, you will be given the opportunity to decline receiving similar emails in the future. 
  * To help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. 

**How We Use Email**

When you trust Really Good Stuff with your e-mail address, we will send you emails necessary to process your order, respond to your requests, and provide additional customer service. We will also notify you about special offers and customer appreciation events. It is our express intent to only send promotional emails to those persons who wish to receive them. Out of respect for your privacy, if at any time you decide you no longer wish to receive email communications, you can easily opt-out by unsubscribing. The [unsubscribe link](http://www.reallygoodstuff.com/email_preference_opt_down/a/email_preference_opt_down/) is included at the bottom of every e-mail communication.

You may also opt out by contacting us at [writeus@reallygoodstuff.com](mailto:writeus@reallygoodstuff.com) or by calling Customer Service@ 1-877-876-1920. 

**Sharing Information with you.**

On occasion, other companies come to us with great offers on products which we think might be of interest to you. We are very discriminating about who these companies are, because our relationship with you is very important to us. If you would prefer not to receive such offers, please email us at [writeus@reallygoodstuff.com](mailto:writeus@reallygoodstuff.com) to inform our customer service representatives of your preferences. And even if we do send an offer your way, you will always be given an opportunity to decline receiving similar emails in the future. 

**We want to give you the best service in the most secure way.**

In order to offer the best products for your personal needs, we like to understand how you use our website. So we have carefully selected a company, Google Analytics that will assist us. We send your information to Google Analytics who works on our behalf to provide us with services to analyze your information None of this information is personally identifiable, meaning that it does not include name or street address information or phone numberof any individual. And, Really Good Stuff®. does not allow Google Analytics to collect credit card, username or password information. 

**Is it safe to use my credit card?**

Really Good Stuff® values our customers' privacy and security. That is why we use SSL (Secure Socket Layer) Protection to insure the highest level of safety for credit card transactions.
