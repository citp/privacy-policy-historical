This notice describes how such Information may be used or disclosed by ReadyGraph.&nbsp; Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meanings set forth in the Terms of Service.&nbsp; &nbsp;Please note that for data collected through ReadyGraph-powered sites, ReadyGraph may be acting as a data processor and service provider and collecting the data on behalf of our business clients (“Clients”).  As part of the operation of the Service, we collect and may disclose information about you. By accepting and using the Service, you consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please refer to the end of this Privacy Policy for information on how to contact us.

We may collect information that can identify you such as your name and email address ("personal information") and other information that does not identify you. We may collect this information through a ReadyGraph-powered website, ReadyGraph.com or a mobile or social (e.g. Facebook app) application. When you provide personal information through our website, the information may be sent to servers located in the United States and other countries around the world.
</p><p> Information you provide. We may collect and store any personal information you enter on our website or on a mobile application, or provide to us in some other manner. This includes but is not limited to identifying information, such as your name, address, email address and telephone number, and, if you transact business with us, financial information such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information). You may also provide us information about your social connections, interests and activities, your gender and age, and other demographic information such as your hometown or your username.
</p><p> Information from other sources. We may receive information about our users from third party social platforms, such as Facebook. When you access or use our website or mobile application through such a site, you allow us to access or collect information made available by the third party site in accordance with its privacy policy. This information may be available from your profile or account with such site or from cookies placed on your device by the third party platform.
</p><p>Information about others. We may collect and store personal information about other people that you provide to us, such as but not limited to their name, address and email address. If you use our website to send others (friends, relatives, colleagues, etc.) an invitation to Readygraph.com or a ReadyGraph-powered site or mobile or social app, we may store your personal information, and the personal information of each such recipient in order to process those requests or facilitate future activities.
</p><p>Use of cookies and other technologies to collect information. We use various technologies to collect information from your device and about your activities on the Service.</p><p>Information collected automatically. We automatically collect information from your browser or device when you visit any ReadyGraph-powered property or application. This information could include your IP address, device ID, your browser type and language, access times, the content of any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us (see "Cookies" below), and the referring website address.
</p><p>Cookies and Use of Cookie Data. When you visit our Service, we may assign your device one or more cookies, to facilitate access to our site and to personalize your online experience. Through the use of a cookie, we also may automatically collect information about your online activity on our site, such as the pages you visit, the time and date of your visits, the links you click, and the searches you conduct on our site. During your visits to other websites or applications where we advertise, we (or third parties) may use certain data collected on our site to show you ReadyGraph advertisements. Although you may not opt out of receiving online advertisements generally, you may control the collection of data on our site used for targeted ReadyGraph advertising during your visits to other websites. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If you choose to decline cookies, please note that you may not be able to sign in or use some of the interactive features offered on our Service.
</p><p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's device for record keeping purposes. Cookies can be either session cookies or persistent cookies. A session cookie expires when you close your browser and is used to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A persistent cookie remains on your device for an extended period of time. Cookies on our site do not link to or store your personal information.</p><p>For example, when you sign in to the Service, we will record your user or member ID and the name associated with your user or member ID in the cookie file on your computer. We also may record your password in this cookie file, if you indicated that you would like your password saved for automatic sign-in. We may allow our service providers to serve cookies from our website or application to allow them to assist us in various activities, such as doing analysis and research on the effectiveness of our site, content and advertising.</p><p>You may delete or decline cookies by changing your browser settings. (Click "Help" in the toolbar of most browsers for instructions.) If you do so, some of the features and services of our website may not function properly.</p><p>We may allow third-parties, including advertising companies, analytics companies, and ad networks, to display advertisements on our site. These companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements or our website or mobile applications. They may collect information about where you, or others who are using your device, saw and/or clicked on the advertisements they deliver (such as click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over, etc.), and possibly associate this information with your subsequent visits to the advertised websites or other data they have collected. They also may combine this information with personal information they collect from you to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. The collection and use of that information is subject to the third-party's privacy policy. This policy covers the use of cookies by ReadyGraph only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
</p><p>Notwithstanding any other provision, we may also engage a data provider who may collect web log data from you (including IP address and information about your browser or operating system), or place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to enable you to receive customized ads or content.   These cookies contain no personally identifiable information.  The cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us, e.g., your email address, that we may share with a data provider solely in hashed, non-human readable form. To opt-out of these data provider cookies, please go to http://www.aboutads.info/choices.
</p><p>Other Technologies. We may use standard Internet technology, such as web beacons and other similar technologies, to track your use of our Service. We also may include web beacons in advertisements or email messages to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. The information we obtain in this manner enables us to customize the services we offer our website or application visitors to deliver targeted advertisements and to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, programming or other activities.</p><p>Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users or to access cookies. Unlike cookies which are stored on the user's device, web beacons are embedded invisibly on the web pages (or in email).
</p><p>Web beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who have visited certain pages and to understand usage patterns. We also may receive an anonymous identification number if you come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website. Third parties may use anonymous information about your visits to our site and other websites in order to improve its products and services and provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.</p><p>Information collected by third-parties. We may allow service providers, advertising companies and ad networks, and other third parties to display advertisements on our site. These companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements.
