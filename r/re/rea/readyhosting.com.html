This Privacy Policy describes how ReadyHosting.com collects information from all end users of ReadyHosting.com's Internet and web hosting services (the "Services")-those who access some of our Services but do not have accounts ("Visitors") as well as those who pay a service fee to subscribe to the Service ("Members")-what we do with the information we collect, and the choices Visitors and Members have concerning the collection and use of such information. ReadyHosting.com requests that you read this Privacy Policy carefully. </font></p>
                  <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Personal Information ReadyHosting.com Collects and How It Is Used</font></b></p>
                  <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Introduction.</font></b> <font face="Arial" size="-1"> ReadyHosting.com collects information in different ways from Visitors and Members who access the various parts of our Services and the network of Web sites accessible through our Service. We use this information primarily to provide a customized experience as you use our Services and, generally, do not share this information with third parties. However, we may disclose personal information collected if we have received your permission beforehand or in very special circumstances, such as when we believe that such disclosure is required by law or other special cases described below. </font></p>
                  <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Registration.</font></b><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Members are asked to provide certain personal information when they sign up for our Services including name, address, telephone number, billing information (such as a credit card number), and the type of personal computer being used to access the Services. The personal information collected from Members during the registration process is used to manage each Member's account (such as for billing purposes). This information is not shared with third parties, unless specifically stated otherwise or in special circumstances. However, in instances where ReadyHosting.com and a partner jointly promote the Services, ReadyHosting.com may provide the partner certain personal information, such as the name, address, and username of persons who subscribed to the Services as a result of the joint promotion for the sole purpose of allowing us and the partner to assess the results of the promotion. In this instance, personal information may not be used by the partner for any other purpose. ReadyHosting.com may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from personal information Members provide during registration (such as the total number, but not the names, of Members). As explained in more detail below, we may use this aggregated and non-identifying information to sell advertisements that appear on the Services. </font></p>
                  <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">ReadyHosting.com Partners and Sponsors.</font></b><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Some ReadyHosting.com products and services are offered to Visitors and Members in conjunction with a non-affiliated partner. To provide Visitors and Members some of these products and services, the partner may need to collect and maintain personal information. ReadyHosting.com will share nonidentifying and aggregate information (except as described above), but not personal information, with such partners in order to administer the co-branded products or services offered. </font></p>
                  <p><b><font face="Arial" size="-1">Online Advertisements.</font></b><font face="Arial" size="-1"> From time to time, ReadyHosting.com may display online advertisements. We share aggregated and non-identifying information about our Visitors and Members collected through the registration process as well as through online surveys and promotions with these advertisers. Additionally, in some instances, we use this aggregated and non-identifying information to deliver tailored advertisements. For instance, an advertiser tells us the audience they want to reach (for example, males between 25 and 55 years of age) and provides us an advertisement tailored to the audience. Based upon the aggregated and non-identifying information we have collected, we may then display the advertisement to the intended audience. ReadyHosting.com does not share personal information about its Visitors or Members with these advertisers.</font></p>
                  <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Responses to Email Inquiries.</font></b><font face="Arial" size="-1"> When Visitors or Members send email inquiries to ReadyHosting.com, the return email address is used to answer the email inquiry we receive. ReadyHosting.com does not use the return email address for any other purpose and does not share the return email address with any third party. </font></p>
                  <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Voluntary Customer Surveys.</font></b><font face="Arial" size="-1"> We may periodically conduct both business and individual customer surveys. We encourage our customers to participate in these surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to improve the types of services we offer and how we provide them to you. Your personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential, even if the survey is conducted by a third party. Participation in our customer surveys is voluntary. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">We take the information we receive from individuals responding to our Customer Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses of other ReadyHosting.com customers to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). We then use the aggregated information to improve the quality of our services to you, and to develop new services and products. This aggregated, non-personally identifying information may be shared with third parties.</font></p>
                  <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Special Cases.</font></b> <font face="Arial" size="-1"> It is ReadyHosting.com's policy not to use or share the personal information about Visitors of Members in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. However, ReadyHosting.com may disclose personal information about Visitors or Members, or information regarding your use of the Services or Web sites accessible through our Services, for any reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including: to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental or legal requests for such information; to disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of Service or other user policies; to operate the Services properly; or to protect ReadyHosting.com and our Members. </font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Registration for Promotions:</font></b>  <font face="Arial" size="-1">From time to time, ReadyHosting.com may on its own, or in conjunction with other partners, offer certain promotions or giveaways which require registration.  If you register for such a promotion or giveaway, ReadyHosting.com may use your registration/contact information to send notification to you of ReadyHosting.com services by e-mail and/or postal mail.  ReadyHosting.com may also share your registration information with our clients, business partners or other third parties.  As a result, our clients, business partners or third parties may also send you promotional material.  ReadyHosting.com may also use your IP address internally and share it with third parties.</font></p>

                  <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">"Cookies" and How ReadyHosting.com Uses Them.</font></b><font face="Arial" size="-1"> A "cookie" is a small data file that can be placed on your hard drive when you visit certain Web sites. ReadyHosting.com may use cookies to collect, store, and sometimes track information for statistical purposes to improve the products and services we provide and to manage our telecommunications networks.
