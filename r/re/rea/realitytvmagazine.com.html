<h1 align="center">Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>This privacy policy was last modified on <!-- #BeginDate format:fcAm1a -->Friday, May 22, 2009 7:05 PM<!-- #EndDate --></p>
<p>SheKnows,  LLC ("Company," "we," or "us") knows  that you care how information about you is used and shared. This Privacy Policy explains what information  of yours will be collected by Company when you use SheKnows.com and related services (the  "Service"), how the information will be used, and how you can control the  collection, correction and/or deletion of information. We will  not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this  Privacy Policy. </p>
<p align="left"><strong>Information We Collect</strong></p>
<p><strong>User-Provided  Information: </strong> You provide us  information about yourself, such as your name and e-mail address, when you  register with the Service. If you  correspond with us by email, we may retain the content of your email messages,  your email address and our responses. </p>
<p><strong>Cookies Information: </strong>When you visit SheKnows.com, we may send one or more  cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to  your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets Company help you  log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie does not collect personal  information about you. Company uses both  session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains on your  hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your  browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by  following your web browser's directions. A session cookie is temporary and  disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to  refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some  features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept  cookies is disabled.</p>
<p><strong>Log File Information: </strong>Log file information is automatically  reported by your browser each time you access a web page. When you register with or view our site, our  servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends  whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include information such  as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type,  referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages,  pages viewed, and other such information.</p>
<p><strong>Clear Gifs  Information: </strong> When you use the  Service, we may employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons) which are used to track  the online usage patterns of our users anonymously. No personally identifiable information from  your Company account is collected using these clear gifs. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in  HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by  recipients. The information is used to  enable more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our marketing, and  make us better for our users.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>How We Use Your Information</strong></p>
<p>We use the  personal information you submit to operate, maintain, and provide to you the  features and functionality of the Service. </p>
<p>Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose for  posting to the Service (for instance, in User Content you post) becomes  available to the public. If you remove  User Content, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if  other users have copied or stored your User Content.</p>
<p>By providing Company  your email address you consent to our using the email address to send you  Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of  communication by postal mail. We may also use your email address to send you  other messages, such as newsletters, changes to features of the Service, or  special offers. If you do not want to  receive such email messages, you may opt out by sending an email message to feedback@sheknowsllc.com  with the word "No email" in the subject field. Opting out may prevent you from receiving  email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers. </p>
<p>Company may use certain information about you and/or your User  Content without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We do this  for purposes such as analyzing how the Service is used, diagnosing service or  technical problems, maintaining security, and personalizing advertisements and  promotions.</p>
<p>Company reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor  the User Content you post on the site. Company has the right to remove any such  information or material for any reason or no reason, including without  limitation, if in its sole opinion, such information or material violates, or  may violate, any applicable law or our Terms of Use Agreement or to protect or  defend its rights or property or those of any third party. Company also reserves the right to remove  information upon the request of any third party.</p>
<p>We use cookies, clear gifs, and  log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to  re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide  custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of  our service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors and  traffic; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems reported by our users or  engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific  web company or ISP; and (f) help you efficiently access your information after  you sign in.</p>
<p><strong>How We Share Your Information</strong></p>
<p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information: </strong>Company will not  rent or sell your personally identifiable information to others. Company may share your personally  identifiable information with third parties solely for the purpose of providing  services to you. If we do this, such  third parties' use of your information will be bound by this Privacy  Policy. We may store personal  information in locations outside the direct control of Company (for instance,  on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).</p>
<p>As we develop  our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email,  and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in  these types of transactions. We may also transfer such information in the  course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution. </p>
<p>Except as otherwise described in  this privacy statement, Company will not disclose personal information to any  third party unless required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that  such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law, comply with legal process  served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take action  regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce our Terms of  Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves  against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement  agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and (c) to  exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Company, our users  or others.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information: </strong>We may share  non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data,  referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc. ) with  interested third parties to help them understand the usage patterns for certain  Company services.</p>
<p>Company  allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve  advertisements on the Company site. These third-party ad servers or ad networks  use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links  that appear on Company. They automatically receive your IP address when this  happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or  Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize  the advertising content.</p>
<p>Company does  not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad  servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an  advertiser asks Company to show an advertisement to a certain audience and you  respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that  you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. </p>
<p>You should  consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad  networks. The Company privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control  the activities of, such advertisers. </p>
<p align="left"><strong>How We Protect Your  Information</strong></p>
<p>Company uses commercially reasonable  physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and  security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant  the security of any information you transmit to Company and you do so at your  own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Company makes  commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However,  please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be  accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical,  or managerial safeguards. </p>
<p>To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as  requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you  access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your  unique password and account information, and for controlling access to your  email communications from Company, at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Compromise of Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>In the event  that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, Company  will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been  compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this  Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.</p>
<p><strong>Your Choices About Your Information</strong></p>
<p>You may, of course, decline to  submit personally identifiable information through Company, in which case Company  may not be able to provide certain services to you. </p>
<p><strong>Children's Privacy</strong></p>
<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially  important. For that reason, Company does  not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age  of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 13, please  do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address,  telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide  any personal information to or on Company. In the event that we learn that we  have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without  verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as  possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a  child under 13, please contact us at <a href="mailto:feedback@sheknowsllc.com">feedback@sheknowsllc.com</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Links to Other Web  Sites</strong></p>
<p>We are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites  linked to or from our Web site nor the information or content contained  therein. Please remember that when you  use a link to go from our Web site to another Web site, our Privacy Policy is  no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other Web site,  including those that have a link on our Web site, is subject to that Web site's  own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before  proceeding.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Notification Procedures</strong></p>
<p align="left">It is our  policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law  or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email  notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice  on our Website page, as determined by Company in its sole discretion. We  reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to  you, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as  described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Changes to Our Privacy  Policy</strong></p>
<p>If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post  those changes on our website to keep you aware of what information we collect,  how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective  when they are posted on this page.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about  this Privacy Policy, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this Web  site, please contact us at <a href="mailto:feedback@sheknowsllc.com">feedback@sheknowsllc.com</a>, or send  mail to:</p>
