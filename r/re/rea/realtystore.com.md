# Privacy Policy - RealtyStore

**RealtyStore respects and protects your privacy**

Last Updated: December 11, 2007

**RealtyStore.com Privacy Pledge:** We do not collect any personal information from you that you do not volunteer, and we are the sole owner of all information collected on this site. We fully disclose our privacy policy in this document. If you have any questions or comments, you are invited to email us at support@realtystore.com

**Privacy Statement:**  
By registering or using services obtained through our Web site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. 

We collect Personally Identifiable Information when you register to use this site; when you use, participate or purchase products and services through this site; and when you ask to be provided additional services. The type of personal information that we collect may include full name, email, telephone number, address, payment information, profession, company name, company website address, business telephone number and photo. This personal information is generally required if you wish to enroll or participate in our services. We may sell or distribute certain individual personal information to other companies, including related interests or vendors so as to provide you with important offers. We may keep all information collected in accordance with this Privacy Policy indefinitely. 

When you register for the RealtyStore.com Professional Network, certain information you post or share with third parties, such as personal information, comments, messages, photos, or other information, will be shared with other users who have access to the Network. All such sharing of information is done at your own risk. Please be aware that we may amend this policy at our sole discretion. You can check back to view changes at anytime by visiting the site www.RealtyStore.com and clicking on the privacy link at the bottom of the page. 

When you register with RealtyStore.com and you leave the box checked stating "Yes, I want to receive information and offers from Offers-RealtyStore.com" - you explicitly authorize us to share your information with Datran Media to contact you via email.

**Personally Identifiable Information:**  
Personally Identifiable Information refers to any information that can be used to identify you as an individual in any way. Enrollment in any RealtyStore.com service is contingent upon your agreeing to the Terms and Conditions of membership and providing personally identifiable information as described above. 

**Anti-SPAM Policy:**  
The RealtyStore.com marketing program is an opt-in system with a strict policy regarding unsolicited email. Because email is an integral part of our services, your signup ensures that you'll receive information relative to your interests at the time of your enrollment from RealtyStore.com. If you later wish to cease participation in this portion of our services, you may do so at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link or button.

Please note that opting not to receive email does not exempt you from receiving administrative emails, which include but are not limited to, notices about membership status changes and alterations to our Terms of Use.

**Aggregate Data:**  
We may, from time to time, contact you regarding opportunities that may be of interest to you. In that process, we may use a third party service provider to manage our database and communication system in order to send that correspondence to you on our behalf. If you respond to a communication to take advantage of an offer you may see or receive, you share your Personally Identifiable Information with a third party. From time to time, we do share non-personally identifiable information collected in aggregate, anonymous form with third parties so that they may better evaluate what products and services are most appealing to different segments of our member base.

**Automatically Collected Information:**  
When you log on to our website, the server may automatically recognize you by an encrypted member key, also referred to as a "cookie." This cookie acts as a unique identifier.

We may use third party cookies and clear pixels (also referred to as "web beacons") to measure page views and email responses. These devices allow us to identify unique visitors to our site and act as a counter for ongoing monitoring of site, email and corresponding future transaction activity related to a specific offer.

**Third-Party Websites:**  
While we make every effort to ensure that our advertisers post Privacy Policies and observe appropriate data practices, we are not responsible or liable for the content or data practices of any third-party site, including those of our advertisers, affiliates, partners, or vendors. We recommend that you read the privacy policy of all third-party sites carefully before sharing your Personally Identifiable Information with them.

Occasionally, you may be offered the opportunity to participate in an offer or service that, by its very terms, will require us to forward your Personally Identifiable Information to the advertiser or partner so that they can provide the service to you. This may include mailing address for delivery of orders and gift certificates or, if you join our program or service through a partner, your basic enrollment information. As always, it is your choice to participate.

We do not guarantee the content or information practices of any third-party site. You alone are responsible for determining the appropriateness of sharing your Personally Identifiable Information with our advertisers.

**Communication:**  
We are available to you during normal business hours to answer any privacy-related questions or concerns you might have. Simply send an email to us at [_support@realtystore.com_](mailto:support@realtystore.com) and we will respond in a timely manner.

You sign up for our marketing program when you submit the information on the first page of our sign-up process, and our marketing partners or we may contact you via email with offers we think you will like. We have a strict Anti-SPAM policy, and you may unsubscribe at any time while still participating in our services.

Members and Program Participants may also receive offers via telephone, voice message, text message, or postal mail. We contact you with offers we think you will like. Members may opt-out of either or both of these communication channels by sending an email to [_support@realtystore.com_](mailto:support@realtystore.com).

We also contact you via email or by phone for administrative purposes, such as Program change notifications, updates, etc. While you can elect to stop receiving email through our marketing program (as described above), you cannot unsubscribe from these administrative only (i.e. non-marketing) messages while enrolled in the RealtyStore.com service.

We do not collect or use any information about you for marketing purposes, except for information that you have provided to us or authorize us to obtain, or is publicly available, and this information is used solely to make our programs and services more relevant to your interests.

**Security:**  
RealtyStore.com has established company-wide security practices for your protection. These practices include, but are not limited to, firewall security, the use of appropriate encryption technology, and the use of multiple levels of password security. All employees are required to familiarize themselves with, and abide by, these safeguards. Our security practices are continually reviewed and upgraded to provide adequate protection of our membership information.

Thank you for becoming familiar with the RealtyStore.com privacy policy. You can always contact us at [_support@realtystore.com_](mailto:support@realtystore.com) with any questions.
