Privacy Policy 

_Effective Date: December 7, 2011_

The ReadWriteWeb website is made available by Weblog Solutions, Ltd., a New Zealand corporation. ReadWriteWeb respects your privacy and recognizes your need for appropriate protection and management of your personal information, such as your name and email address. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand how your personal information is collected and used by us and check back often for updates. Contact us with any questions you may have by emailing [privacy@readwriteweb.com](mailto:privacy@readwriteweb.com). We're always happy to hear from you. 

WHAT INFORMATION DOES READWRITEWEB COLLECT AND HOW?

Personal information collected by ReadWriteWeb is information voluntarily provided to us by you when you subscribe to our newsletter or contact us with a query. Currently, information that we save about you includes your email address and, optionally, your first and last name. This information is maintained on secure third-party servers. You may unsubscribe from our email distribution lists via a link at the bottom of every newsletter, which removes your information from our system and the third-party systems we utilize. We do not save your email after you have unsubscribed from all newsletters. 

If you ask us to send you a premium report, which we may also refer to as a "free brief", we may also ask for your physical mailing address, name, email and phone number. In this case, your name and contact details may be used to verify billing information or shared with the third party sponsor(s) of the brief that you request. You will be notified of possible disclosure to third party sponsors at the time you request a brief, prior to confirming your order. Sponsors may use your mailing address to contact you regarding offers that they feel may be of interest to you. We have no control over the use a Sponsor may make of your contact information. 

If you chose to make a comment on our site, your user name or profile picture may appear alongside your comment. Comments are stored on a secure third-party server. Additionally, the ReadWriteWeb website uses "cookies" to track and collect information about you and your visit to our site, such as IP address, browser, flash version number, operating system, screen resolution, time of visit, etc. A cookie is a small string of text that a website can send to your browser, for the purpose of enhancing our understanding of site user activity and your visit to the website. A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, or capture your email address. You can set your computer settings to alert you when a cookie is being placed. You may also clear all cookies saved to your computer by using the relevant selection in your internet browser. We use cookie information to understand from where in the world our site traffic comes. Based upon the information collected by cookies, we may also suggest posts or show ads that we think will be of interest to you. 

Our site uses third-party tools (eg., google analytics, Facebook connect, google+ and others) that may also use cookies to collect anonymous data. Advertisers on our site may also place cookies. We have no control over how third-party tools and advertisers use cookies.

HOW READWRITEWEB USES YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

When you choose to provide us your email address, we may use it to send you our newsletter (if you have so requested) or to reply to a message that you have sent to us. ReadWriteWeb does not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others. We will not disclose your personal information to others without your express permission, other than as set forth in this privacy policy. ReadWriteWeb does not supplement the personal information provided by you with information collected from other sources. 

We may also use your personal information to contact you from time to time by email regarding updates to our policies or to send you other information that we feel may be of interest to you. We may email you about events to be held or attended by ReadWriteWeb or other partner events and offers that we feel may be of interest to you.

ReadWriteWeb may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.

We may also release personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law or to protect the rights of ReadWriteWeb or others. Your personal information is, of course, subject to disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants or orders.
