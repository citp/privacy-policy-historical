# About RealAge — RealAge Privacy Statement

RealAge is committed to protecting your privacy. We have prepared this Privacy Statement to describe to you our practices regarding the Personal Data we collect from users of our services. 

**A Note to Non-U.S. Users**   
YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT. YOUR PERSONAL DATA MAY BE PROCESSED IN THE UNITED STATES. UNITED STATES LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY. 

**A Note to California and Canada Users**   
California and Canada residents have the right to know how their information may be shared with third parties who engage in direct marketing activities, and this Privacy Policy explains our practices and how you can opt out of having your information shared for such purposes. 

**Types of Data We Collect**   
RealAge collects Personal Data, Personal Postal Data, and Anonymous Data when you visit our site or when you send us information or communications. "Personal Data" means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name and e-mail address as well as any information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data. “Personal Postal Data” means data that allows someone to identify or contact you via your name and mailing address. "Anonymous Data" means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data; Anonymous Data does not permit the identification of individual persons. We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data as described below. 

**Personal Data You Provide to Us**   
We collect Personal Data from you, such as your name, e-mail address, country of residence, zip code or mail code, gender, and/or birth date when you register for a membership with us or when you choose to use the various services we provide on our site (e.g., Tip of the Day, Health Assessments, etc.). We also collect other types of Personal Data that you provide to us voluntarily, such as your health-related information when you respond to surveys, health assessments, and questionnaires. If you provide us feedback regarding our site or services via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address in order to send you a reply. 

In order to improve our services to you, we may ask you to voluntarily complete confidential surveys. We do not ask you to provide us any personally identifiable data in association with these surveys, although we do associate your responses with Personal Data. If you do not wish to participate in a survey, however, simply decline to participate when asked. 

**Personal Data Collected via Technology**   
To make our services more useful to you, we use technological means to collect Personal Data from you, including the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) you just came from, the URL you go to next, your browser type, and your Internet Protocol (IP) address. We also use cookies or clear GIFs to collect Personal Data from you about your use of our site or e-mails we send you. You expressly consent to our use of cookies and clear GIFs when you use our services. 

An "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases, your IP address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer Internet access provider, your IP address probably varies from session to session. We track IP addresses solely in conjunction with session cookies to analyze our Web page flow. 

"Cookies" are small pieces of information that a Web site sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a Web site. RealAge uses both session cookies (which expire once you close your Web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our site. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can disable this function by changing the cookie profile on your computer’s Web browser. If you disable your cookies, however, you will not have access to certain features of our site, such as "Remember My Password" or interactive quizzes. RealAge does not store any Personal Data in cookies on your computer (other than the cookie itself). 

"Clear GIFs" are clear electronic images that are used to track your movements on our site. They help us to determine whether content on our site is effective. We also use clear GIFs in HTML-based e-mails to let us know which e-mails have been opened and acted upon by recipients (including any persons to which the e-mails have been forwarded). Clear GIFs on our sites collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the clear GIF resides. This information helps us assess the effectiveness of certain communications and marketing campaigns. 

**Personal Data That We Collect from You About Others**   
If you decide to invite a friend or family member to join RealAge via a Tip of the Day, Health Assessment invitation, or other means in the future, we will collect your name and e-mail address as well as your friend’s or family member’s e-mail address in order to send this e-mail. This information is used once only and is not saved in our database, with the exception of the RealAge Challenge, in which case the friend's e-mail address is stored only for Challenge participation purposes. If you decide to invite a friend or family member to take the RealAge Test, we will collect and save the friend’s or family member’s e-mail address into our database, as we would for anyone who registers on the RealAge site. 

**Personally Identifying Data Collected by Third Parties**   
Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Privacy Statement, only RealAge collects Personally Identifying Data through the services provided solely by RealAge; this Privacy Statement applies only to the use and disclosure of Personally Identifying Data that we collect while you use our services. 

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, e-mail address, or postal address) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here: ([ http://networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp](http://networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp)). Furthermore, when you click on such advertisements or links, you will leave our site and go to another site. During this process, a third party (including a third-party advertising service that may provide services to an advertiser) may collect Personally Identifying Data or Anonymous Data from you, such as the URL you just came from, the URL you go to next, your browser type, and your IP address. Our display of advertisements or links to any other company or site is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such company or site (or the contents of the site). We have no control over, we do not review, and our Privacy Statement does not apply to these other companies, sites, or content, or to any collection of data after you click on an advertisement of or link to a third party. 

**Use of Your Data**   
RealAge uses your Personal Data to provide you with a customized Web experience and to provide services to you. Such services include calculating your RealAge, processing your answers to quizzes to provide you with tailored information regarding your health, and sending electronic newsletters and promotional e-mails to you if you have requested to receive such communications from us (as described below). We also use Personal Data to notify you about updates to our services and to respond to your requests. 

We may create Anonymous Data records from Personal Data by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the data personally identifiable to you. We use this Anonymous Data to perform statistical analyses of users’ aggregate behavior so that we may enhance the content of our services and improve site navigation. RealAge reserves the right to use and disclose Anonymous Data to third parties in its discretion. 

If you elect to say yes to becoming a free RealAge Member (as described below), we will periodically send you free newsletters and e-mails that directly promote the use of our site(s) or the purchase of our products or services and may contain, in whole or in part, advertisements for third parties which relate to marketed products of selected RealAge partners. As a benefit of becoming a member, you may receive promotional e-mail from RealAge properties such as DogAge, CatAge, and others. 

**Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Personal Postal Data**   
Except as otherwise stated in this policy, we do not sell, trade, or rent the Personal Data collected from our services to third parties. However, we will share your Personal Data with third parties to fulfill the services that you have asked us to provide to you, including but not limited to sending you free newsletters and promotional e-mails. These third parties are required not to use your Personal Data other than to provide the services requested by RealAge. You expressly consent to the sharing of your Personal Data with our contractors and third-party service providers for the sole purpose of providing services to you. 

If you send a testimonial or comment to us, we may post it on our site or use it in advertising materials. We will attribute your testimonial to you by posting your first and last initial or your first name and last initial next to your testimonial on our site or advertising materials, if provided. 

Regardless of any choices you make regarding your Personal Data (as described below), RealAge may disclose Personal Data if it believes in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on RealAge; or (b) protect or defend the rights or property of RealAge or users of RealAge services. 

RealAge is a company with either subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, "affiliates"). These affiliates include but are not limited to DogAge and CatAge. We may share some or all of your Personal Data and Personal Postal Data with these affiliates, in which case we will require our affiliates to honor this Privacy Statement. If another company acquires our company or our assets, that company will possess the Personal Data and Personal Postal Data collected by it and us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Data and Personal Postal Data as described in this Privacy Statement. 

If you provide RealAge with Personal Postal Data, we may share your name and mailing address with our affiliates or other third-party businesses that offer goods or services that we believe may be of interest to our customers. Many customers appreciate the offerings they receive from such third parties; however, we allow you to opt out of having your Personal Data shared with affiliated or unaffiliated third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To submit such an opt-out request, please go to [My Account](http://www.realage.com/reg/MyAcntTC.aspx) or write to:  
_RealAge, Inc._  
Attn: Mailing Address Removal

On most of our sites, RealAge enables the use of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology and Verisign Site ID, the industry leaders in providing secure communication over the Internet. SSL can be engaged by choosing to switch to SSL during any interaction in which you enter Personal Data. We also offer industry-standard secured-server transactions that encrypt your Personal Data when collecting your credit card information for online purchases. To verify that you have a secure server connection, look for the locked padlock symbol at the bottom of your browser window or the HTMLS-code in the site connection identifier.
