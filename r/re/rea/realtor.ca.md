**Privacy**

It is the policy of The Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) that personal information, such as your name, postal and e-mail address or telephone number is private and confidential. Because your privacy is important to us, CREA maintains an Internet privacy policy to protect your personal information on its REALTOR.ca website. 

This web site consists of, and includes links to many sites including home pages of REALTORS® and real estate Boards and, in some cases, Board listing information sites. This privacy policy applies only to those sites which display the CREA Privacy Policy statement. While CREA encourages the site operators to comply with these principles, users should carefully examine the privacy statements of sites appearing on, or linking to or from this site, which do not display the CREA Privacy statement. Personal information that you choose to provide to other sites will be subject to the privacy policies of those sites. 

CREA at all times adheres to applicable legal or regulatory requirement(s) concerning the storage and protection of personal information. While CREA is the custodian of the Personal Information provided to it, it does use third party service providers. Some of these service providers and the databases where they store personal information are located outside of Canada. You should note that where Personal Information is located outside of Canada, it is subject to the laws of that jurisdiction in which it is located. 

Throughout your use of the real estate services on this site, you may communicate extensively with a REALTOR® or Broker. The agent may use your email address and all of the information you submit in order to provide you with guidance, suggestions and service in your efforts to either sell or buy real estate. The Canadian Real Estate Association also collects the e-mail address provided through the "Contact Us" feature of this web site, so we can respond to your questions or suggestions. 

Similar to other commercial web sites, our web site utilizes a standard technology called "cookies" and web server logs to collect information about how our web site is used. Each time a visitor comes to the REALTOR.ca site, our web server collects only the visitor's domain name or IP address but not the e-mail address. This information may be consolidated into group data, which may be shared on an aggregated basis with research firms and member Boards and Associations. The shared data will not disclose your identity or personal data and will not enable the recipients to contact you. 

The data collected is also used to help CREA analyze the browsing patterns of its visitors in order to improve the content and design of REALTOR.ca. Personal information will not be sold to any third parties, nor will such information be added to bulk e-mailing lists. 

CREA is licensed to use Microsoft’s Bing Map on REALTOR.ca. Visitors to this website should be aware that Microsoft might collect information such as, but not limited to, an end user’s IP address, request, time of submission, and results returned to the user, in connection with the use of the embedded Bing Maps. All such information collected will be subject to, and used in accordance with, the data practices described in the Microsoft Online Privacy Statement, which is available at <http://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/fullnotice.aspx>. 

Our website is also currently allowing a third-party company, ValueClick Inc., to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when visitors use our web site. ValueClick may use cookies or web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date) during your visit to this website in order to help show advertisements on other websites likely to be more interesting to you. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit <http://www.networkadvertising.org/>.

Any changes to the CREA Privacy Policy will be promptly communicated on this page. Policy changes will not alter how we handle previously submitted personal information.
