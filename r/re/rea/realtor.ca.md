## General

CREA values your privacy. As such, it is the policy of The Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) that personal information, such as your name, gender, postal and e-mail address or telephone number is private and confidential. Because your privacy is important to us, CREA maintains this privacy policy to explain how CREA collects, uses and discloses your personal information, including information collected from social media sites, on its websites and mobile applications (collectively, hereinafter "website" or "websites"). Personal information collected by CREA may be used for the following general purposes:

  * For registration and to manage your website account.
  * To send you communications you have opted-in to receive.
  * To respond to your questions and comments.
  * To tailor your experience of the website.
  * To help CREA analyze the browsing patterns of its users in order to improve the content and design of its websites.
  * For security purposes, such as the prevention of potentially prohibited or illegal activities.
  * To enforce the website terms of use.
  * For statistical analysis.
  * As otherwise described in this privacy policy.
  * As otherwise described to you when the information is collected.



Personal information may be anonymized and consolidated into group data, which may be shared on an aggregated basis with research firms and member Boards and Associations. The shared data will not disclose your personal information and will not enable the recipients to contact you.

## Third Party Links and Sources of Information

This website consists of, and includes links to, many websites, including: REALTOR® member and real estate Board home pages, social media sites (such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Google and Twitter), map sites, and, in some cases, Board listing information sites. This privacy policy applies only to those sites which display this statement. While CREA encourages the site operators to comply with these principles, you should carefully examine the privacy policies of sites appearing on, or linking to or from this website, which do not display this privacy policy. Personal information that you choose to provide to other websites will be subject to the privacy policies of those sites.

## Storage and Deletion

CREA at all times adheres to applicable legal or regulatory requirement(s) concerning the storage and protection of personal information. While CREA is the custodian of the personal information provided to it, it does use third party service providers. Some of these service providers and the databases where they store personal information are located outside of Canada. You should note that where personal information is located outside of Canada, it is subject to the laws of that jurisdiction in which it is located.

You may delete your website account at any time. Deleting your account will result in the anonymization of your website account personal information except for audit and security purposes.

## Messages

Throughout your use of the real estate services on this website, you may communicate extensively with a salesperson or broker. The salesperson or broker may use your email address and all of the information you submit in order to provide you with guidance, suggestions and service in your efforts to either sell or buy real estate. 

CREA collects the e-mails provided through the "Contact Us" feature of this website, so CREA can respond to your questions or suggestions. CREA also collects e-mails sent through the website, including the "Email a REALTOR®", "Email a Friend", and "Email Office" features, for security purposes, to allow the recipient brokers and salespersons to view your email, to send you communications you have opted-in to receive, and for management of your website account.

## IP Addresses

Similar to other commercial websites, our website collects information about how our website is used. Each time a user comes to the website, our web server collects the user's IP address. While CREA cannot normally determine a user’s identity from an IP address, where you use REALTOR.ca in association with your name or inform CREA support staff of your IP address you may be identifiable. At such time, CREA treats such information as personal information. 

## Cookies

Our website uses standard technology known as "cookies" including session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies temporarily keep your settings. This information is stored until your browser is closed. Persistent cookies are created for specific functions you may choose to use on the website including, but not limited to: accepting terms of use; saving searches; and saving favourites. Persistent cookies are used to improve your experience of the website and are retained from session to session. These cookies remain after the browser is closed and are stored locally on your system. CREA does not track such cookies on CREA servers, nor does CREA use such cookies to store personal information. You may choose to delete persistent cookies after visiting the website.

## Surveys

While visiting our website you may be asked to participate in a survey conducted by a third party. If you are selected to participate in this survey, a persistent cookie is stored on your computer's hard drive for 60 days to preclude a new invitation during that time. All surveys are optional and the information collected will not be associated with any personal information. Survey data is used to permit accurate analysis, produce summary reports, and monitor overall trends with our website. 

## Google Analytics

This website uses Google Analytics, a web and mobile analytics tracking tool provided by Google, for audience activity, demographics reporting, and remarketing. Google Analytics information may be disclosed to REALTORS® with whom you interact with on the website. You can opt-out of Google Analytics by installing a browser plug-in available on Google's website. 

## Disclosure to Law Enforcement

CREA reserves the right to report to law enforcement agencies any uses of REALTOR.ca that it, in good faith, believes to be unlawful. You agree that CREA may release your personal information to law enforcement agencies where CREA has reasonable grounds to believe that such release is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property and safety of CREA or any person.
