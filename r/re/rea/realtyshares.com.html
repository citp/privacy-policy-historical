<h4>Our Policy</h4>

<p>Welcome to the web site www.realtyshares.com (the “Site”) owned and operated by RealtyShares, Inc. (hereinafter, “RealtyShares”, “we”, “us”, and/or “our”).  This Privacy Policy has been created to provide information about our company and its financial matchmaking services (the “Services”) to all visitors of the Site and the users of the Services provided thereon, including, but not limited to, investment managers offering an investment (the “Issuer”) and investors using the site to invest (in each case, a “User”, and collectively, “Users”).  This Privacy Policy sets forth RealtyShares’ policy with respect to information, including personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”), and other information that is collected from Users.    </p>

<p>By using the Site and/or Services, you accept the practices and terms set forth in our Privacy Policy as it may be updated from time to time in RealtyShares’ sole and absolute discretion.</p>

<hr>

<h4>What Information We Collect</h4>

<p>When you interact with us through the Site or Services, we may collect and process Personal Information and other information from you, as further described below: </p>

<p>Personal Information That You Provide Through the Site.  We collect Personal Information from you when you voluntarily provide such information such as when you (i) register for access to the Services (for example, contact information such as your name, email address, phone number, mailing address); (ii) complete certain forms on the Site; (iii) upload or submit any material through the Site, (iv) request any information or contact us with inquiries; or (v) wish to use certain Services (for example financial information such as bank account numbers, your Date of Birth and the last 4 digits of your social security number).  This Personal Information is required to transact business, to communicate with you, verify your identity and fulfill legal and regulatory requirements.  </p>

<p>By voluntarily providing us with Personal Information, you are giving RealtyShares permission to use and store it consistent with this Privacy Policy.  We may also obtain your personal information from your transactions with us or other Users through the Services, or from third parties such as credit reporting agencies.  If we combine or associate information from other sources with personal information that you provide directly to us through or in connection with the Services, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Non-Identifying Information. As is the case with most websites, when you visit the Site or interact with RealtyShares through the Site or Services (and whether or not you register for access to the Services), we receive, automatically track and store certain non-identifying information about you, including but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>browser type; </li>
<li>IP address; </li>
<li>language preference; </li>
<li>cookies; domain servers; </li>
<li>URL traffic to, through and from the Site;</li>
<li>types of computers and operating systems accessing the Site;</li>
<li>statistical information about behavior of visitors/users to the Site; and</li>
<li>any other web site usage information that we may collect when you visit the Site.</li>
</ul>

<p>This information, which may be collected passively using various technologies or through other means, cannot be used to specifically identify you.  RealtyShares may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by RealtyShares affiliates, agents or service providers.  The Site may use such information and pool it with other information for administrative purposes, to assess the usage, value and performance of our products and services, to improve your experience with the Services and to track, for example, how our Users use and interact with the Services.  </p>

<p>Also, in an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Site and Services, RealtyShares often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Information and other information provided to RealtyShares by Issuers and Users. RealtyShares may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our Services to current and prospective business partners and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p>

<hr>

<h4>Technology (Cookies)</h4>

<p>Cookies are small pieces of information which are issued to your computer when you visit a website and which store and sometimes track information about your use of the Services. RealtyShares uses cookies to help recognize you as a repeat visitor, to improve the quality of our Services, and to try and make your browsing experience meaningful. When you enter our Site, our web server sends a cookie to your computer which allows us to recognize your computer but not specifically who is using it. By associating the identification numbers in the cookies with other customer information when, for example, you log-in to the Site or Services, then we know that the cookie information relates to you. Some of the cookies used by our Services are served by us, and some are served by third parties who are delivering services on our behalf.  The use of cookies by any third parties, including our affiliates or service providers, is not covered by this Privacy Policy.  We do not have access or control over these cookies.</p>

<p>Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent this or to notify you each time a cookie is sent. You can also learn more about cookies by visiting www.allaboutcookies.org which includes additional useful information on cookies and how to block cookies using different browsers. By blocking or deleting cookies used on our Site or Services, please note that you may not be able to take full advantage of our Services.  Therefore, we recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Site's features.</p>

<hr>

<li>To help us improve our services to you, we may engage third parties to help us carry out certain internal functions such as account processing, client services or other data collection relevant to our business. Use of any Personal Information shared in connection therewith is strictly limited to the performance of the task we request and for no other purpose.</li>
<li>In the event you indicate an interest in making an investment through our Site, we will notify the Issuer of your interest and will provide your personal information to the Issuer.</li>
<li>We may make certain automatically collected information about your interactions and activities on the Services, such as the business or investment areas of interest to you or you have invested in, and your past activities, projects or proposals, publicly available on or through the Services.

<li>In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Information may be part of the transferred assets and you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Safeguarding User Information</h4>

<p>The Security of your User Information is important to us, and we take commercially reasonable steps to safeguard such information .  These steps and procedural safeguards are in line with industry standards and practices and include:</p>
