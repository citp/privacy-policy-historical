_Reader's Digest Online Privacy Policy**

In over 75 years in the Direct Marketing business, Reader's Digest has adhered to the highest standards in assuring our customers' privacy. All information - including customer accounts, transactions, and all correspondence, are handled with the utmost discretion.

The policies below are applicable to readersdigest.com and other sites on the World Wide Web originating in the U.S. and owned and operated by Reader's Digest unless otherwise indicated.

**

Collection of Personal Information

**

The only personal information collected by Reader’s Digest through our web sites is information which is submitted to us voluntarily and knowingly by site visitors. When you simply browse our sites, no personal information is being collected by Reader’s Digest.

Some functions and services offered through our site require that you provide certain personal information, for example, when you order a product, enter a contest or sweepstakes, request a catalog, or register for a mailing list, we may need your postal or e-mail address. 

**

Receiving E-mail and Postal Correspondence

**

Our online registration forms contain a clearly identified checkbox that indicates that by submitting the form you will be entitled to receive e-mail correspondence from Reader’s Digest, our affiliates and partners unless you opt out of being included in our mailing list. Web site visitors over the age of 18 who have submitted their names, mailing addresses, or e-mail addresses and have not opted out, may occasionally receive e-mail correspondence from Reader’s Digest, our affiliates and partners containing information such as newsletters or special offers. Our purpose is to provide visitors with useful information and offers that will interest them. Reader’s Digest will consider permission granted to send such information if a form is submitted without a check mark in the box labeled "by submitting this form, you will be entitled to receive special offers via e-mail from Reader's Digest, its affiliates and partners. If you do not wish to receive these offers, please check this box."

Reader's Digest will not share e-mail addresses we collect through our web sites with any unaffiliated third parties. Occasionally, Reader's Digest may make names and postal addresses we collect through our web sites available to reputable companies whose products and/or services may interest you unless you opt out of being included in our postal mailing list. 

Reader’s Digest may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third parties for statistical analysis, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information.

**

Opting Out

**

Receiving e-mail messages from Reader’s Digest, our affiliates and partners, is optional. You may choose not to receive e-mail, even after granting prior permission, or you may wish to correct information you previously provided. If you do not wish to receive e-mail or wish to correct information you provided to Reader’s Digest, please click here to go to the [Privacy Options Form](https://web.archive.org/web/20000611102454id_/http%3A//readersdigest.com/custserv/privacy/PrvyOptn.asp) in our Online Customer Service area, or send an e-mail message to "[removeme.rdw@readersdigest.com](mailto:removeme.rdw@readersdigest.com)." 

Reader’s Digest will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete records from our database when we receive requests to do so; however because of possible retention of a residual copy in a system backup file, we cannot guarantee deletion in every instance.

If you prefer not to receive postal mailings from Reader's Digest or from reputable companies we may share your name and postal address with, write to us at the address below or go to the Privacy Options Form in our Online Customer Service area. ****
