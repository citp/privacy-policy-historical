Your privacy is very important to me and I am committed to protecting it. I ask for your email address when you make a comment on this site, but I will **never** sell or share that information unless you are the winner of giveaway. Then I will only give it out to the sponsor of the giveaway so they can send you your prize. Also when you give me your address after you have won a giveaway, I will only send this information to the sponsor for prize shipment.
