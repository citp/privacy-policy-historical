Browser and Flash Cookies

A browser cookie is a small file that websites often store on a user's computer. A Flash cookie is similar to a browser cookie, but is used to store data in conjunction with our web pages that incorporate Adobe Flash applications.  Storage of cookies on your system allows us to personalize or enhance your experience on our website and to make your next visit more convenient and enjoyable. For example, cookies may allow us to remember the content you previously viewed on our website or your log-in information. Cookies may also be used to remember items you have previously placed in your shopping cart when making purchases. We and our third party ad network partners also use cookies to serve interest-based advertisements to you across different websites affiliated with the ad networks, as described in the "Interest-Based Advertising" section below. 

We may link information contained in a cookie to personal information collected from you by other means (e.g., website registration). For more about your choices with respect to cookies, click here.

Clear GIFs

We may use clear GIFs on our website or include them in e-mail messages we send you. Clear GIFs (also known as pixels or web beacons) are small graphic images we include on a web page or in an e-mail message that allow us to determine how users interact with the web page or e-mail. Clear GIFs may be used to share information between us and our advertising partners, or to allow us, or our advertising partners, to communicate with cookies stored on your device. We may also use cookies, clear GIFs, and other tools to collect information about your interactions with third party websites. Clear GIFs may be used to serve interest-based advertisements to you across different websites affiliated with advertising networks, as described in the "Interest-Based Advertising" section below. 

The information collected via clear GIFs may also include some of the information described in the "Other information" section above, as well as information about how a user responds to an e-mail campaign (such as, the time the e-mail is opened, where does the user link to from the e-mail, etc.). We use information collected this way for a variety of purposes, including but not limited to site traffic reporting, unique visitor counts, promotions and marketing involving our advertising partners, advertising and e-mail auditing and reporting, and content personalization.

_From third parties or other sources_

We may also obtain information about you from other sources. For example, we may hire a third party data aggregator to provide us additional information about our existing consumers (this is known as "data appending"). We may also receive information from third parties, such as co-sponsors who we may occasionally partner with to run special contests or other promotions.  We may also collect or obtain information from social media platforms. We may also collect information through the use of third party web analytics services (such as Google Analytics) such as number of visits to a particular page, or the amount of time spent on a web site.  We may also receive information about consumers when we acquire part or all of other companies.

We may also get information from other consumers. For example, we may offer e-cards or tell-a-friend features. 

_Combining Information_

We may combine information we get from one source with other information we may have about you. This might include combining information you submit online with information you submit offline, or information that you submit by e-mail with information that you submit through our websites.
