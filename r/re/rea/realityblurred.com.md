Any data that’s gathered will not be linked to any information that is personally identifiable, and your IP address will be anonymized by Google Analytics.

In order to ensure network and information security and prevent fraud, the web servers that host realityblurred.com may generate and store access, usage, and/or error logs, which may include IP addresses of visitors to the site. Only authorized personnel have access to those sever logs, and they are automatically deleted after seven days.

The “Info” link at the bottom of the survey has details about how the surveys work.

In addition, third-party advertising companies may use non-personally identifiable information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide relevant ads. Other technologies, such as cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons, may also be used by the third-party ad networks to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and/or to personalize the advertising content that you see.

Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on realityblurred.com. Google’s use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to users based on their visit to realityblurred.com and other sites on the Internet.

realityblurred.com itself has no access to or control over these cookies that are used by third-party advertisers. realityblurred.com’s privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.
