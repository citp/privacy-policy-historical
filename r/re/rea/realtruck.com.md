###  Ways We Collect your Information:

We collect your information at registration and during the ordering process. Before checking out and even while placing some items in your shopping cart, RealTruck will require you to enter vehicle information as well as an online registration form. During registration, you will be asked to give us your personal information including your name, shipping and billing address, phone number, payment information (credit card number), and email address.

Additional information required may be your country of residence and your organization's country of operation so that we can adhere to applicable laws and regulations. These pieces of information are used for billing, to complete orders, and to speak with you regarding your order. They may also be used for RealTruck.com's marketing purposes. If we have an issue with your order, we may use this information to contact you.

If you are using the PayPal Credit method of payment, formerly known as Bill Me Later, the last four (4) digits of your social security number and your date of birth are required. This information is used only for the PayPal Credit transaction. It will not be kept in our files.

A few locations on the RealTruck.com website permit you to enter your email address for marketing and communication purposes. These are either to register for a contest or sweepstakes, or to sign up for email newsletters and special offers. Participation in a contest or sweepstakes is completely voluntary. RealTruck will use information to notify contest and sweepstakes winners and to award prizes. We may post on our website the names, photos, videos, cities, and states of contest and sweepstakes winners when applicable. By entering a contest or sweepstakes, you may be opting in to receive our email newsletter and special offers, and this will be disclosed in the official rules governing the contest or sweepstakes. Contest and sweepstakes rules and regulations are outlined per event.

RealTruck.com may contact you via email for transactional purposes if you have previously shared that contact information with us on our site, such as when you subscribe to our email database, create an account, or purchase an item. These messages will be for transactional purposes only, such as following up on an attempted purchase, and are in compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act.

If you voluntarily subscribe to our Email Newsletter, you will receive weekly emails from us about new products, specials, tips, and other promotions.

RealTruck.com is a verified PayPal Payments Pro merchant. Our website is not only protected by secure-transaction technology through PayPal, but we've also taken steps to ensure our environment for collecting your data meets or exceeds their standards for doing business. PayPal is a worldwide leader in the e-commerce industry and has been for over a decade, so you can shop with confidence knowing your credit information is locked down.

In addition to the merchant provided security, RealTruck has added GeoTrust Secure Socket Layer technology to our website. This certificate once again enables us to do business securely and efficiently without fear of transmitting any personal or sensitive data unwittingly to the wrong recipient.
