If you have additional questions, you may send email to [info@react2media.com](mailto:info@react2media.com).

 **OVERVIEW**

  
The Web Site delivers promotional incentives (such as coupons, rebates, savings notices, samples and trial offers) using sophisticated database technology on behalf of online and offline companies (our "Clients") to registered consumers ("you", "your" or "Members") of our Web Site. We have created this Privacy Statement in order to ensure your confidence in us during your use of our Web Site, and demonstrate our firm commitment to fair information practices and the protection of your privacy.

**Collection of Your Information**

**Information Collected to Enroll in the LeadReact Program.**  
To set up your LeadReact membership, you will need to provide certain contact information. The requested information may include any combination of data such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address, phone number, username, and/or password, amongst other contact information requirements. This basic information is required if you wish to enroll on the Web Site. The registration form information requests may change from time to time. We may append additional data we obtain from our other owned web sites or third parties to your enrollment information for analysis and marketing purposes. This information will also allow us to provide better, more relevant offers to you.

**Information Collected During Use of the Web Site.**   
When you select an advertising offer on the Web Site or purchase a subscription or merchandise through the LeadReact service from one of our Clients, we will collect certain personal information as well as possibly financial information (such as your credit card number) to permit you to complete your action. This Client-requested information will only be provided to the specific sponsor of that offer, and only if you choose to share your information for that offer. If you have consented to receive e-mails from us, we also collect information relating to your e-mail response data to enable us to provide more timely, relevant offers and products.

**Information Use and Sharing**

**Generally.** When you become a LeadReact Member, we use your enrollment information and activity data to manage your account. We will not rent, sell or share any personal information we gather from you to third parties except as indicated below or to provide information regarding the products or services you have requested (for example, with your consent we may disclose your personally identifiable information, such as your name and address, to specified third parties that may then send you incentive offers and other promotional materials through the mail or via e-mail). The following describes the ways that your information may be used by us, or may be disclosed in the normal course of business to provide our services.

**Use of Information When You Select an Offer or Purchase a Product/Service.**   
If you are interested in an offer from a Client, we provide you with the opportunity to share some of your contact information with them. The information you submit to Clients is subject to their own privacy policies. For example, you may wish to receive more information directly from a Client via e-mail or postal service, and you can use reply forms at various points on the Web Site to communicate that information to a Client. 

**It is strictly your decision to pass such information to any Client.**   
In addition, ** ** some offers or services will require us, by their terms, to forward your personal information (such as mailing address for delivery of orders) to a Client so that they can provide the service directly to you. Otherwise, your information is shared with Clients only on an aggregate (non-personally identifiable) basis.

**Use of Information to Notify You About Our Products and Services.**   
We may use your information to inform you of other products or services available from React2Media by making opportunities available to you on our various web sites, by postal mail and, unless you opt out of receiving them, by e-mail. We may also send you offers tailored to your interests, as well as information about us, about our products and services, and about special offers such as sweepstakes or other promotions. Sometimes, we send offers via e-mail to selected groups of members on behalf of our participating merchants. When we do this, we do not give the participating merchants your name and address. If you do not want to receive e-mails we send on behalf of our participating merchants, you may opt out of receiving them as detailed in the Opting Out of Marketing E-mail Messages section below.

**Use of Information About You We Obtain from Third Parties.**   
We may obtain information about you from our partner companies and other third parties in order to provide you with opportunities tailored to your interests. We may also use information obtained from our partner companies and other third parties in conjunction with member account and enrollment information for analytical and audit purposes.

**Sharing Information with Our Business Partners and Service Providers.**   
We may need to share some personal information with our business partners, such as service providers and third party processors who work with us to provide you the LeadReact program. These companies use your personal information to provide us with the services we have hired them to perform, such as to organize, administer, process, append and/or analyze our data on our behalf, deliver offline materials to you or notify you of savings when you are visiting other web sites. These companies will help us provide more relevant offers to you and to eliminate the delivery of duplicate offers from a Client(s) and all such business partners are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to the LeadReact program, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information. We may also share certain data with our Clients or service providers in aggregate form for audit, marketing and other purposes. We may transmit your search queries, if any, to business partners who use this information to provide us with search results and other information, which we then display to you. Because aggregated data is not associated with any particular person, the third parties with whom we share this information will not have access to your personally identifiable information.

**Sharing Information with Our Direct Marketing Partners.**   
From time to time, we may provide your postal information and other relevant data to trusted direct marketing partners who may mail direct marketing material on behalf of us and also use this postal information and other data to market to you on their own behalf. In our contact with these direct marketing partners, we have restricted them from sharing or selling this information with any other third party. We do not provide your e-mail address to these direct marketing partners.

**Legal Requests/Questionable Activities.**   
We will release or disclose your personal information, including to local, state, or federal law enforcement officials, when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, or when required to do so by order of a court or authorized administrative agency.

**Sale/Merger.**   
We will transfer information about you if we are acquired by or merged with another company. We will notify you in accordance with the procedures contained in the Privacy Statement Updates and Web Site Maintenance section of this Privacy Statement if your information will become subject to a different privacy policy.

 **ACCESS AND OPTIONS**

  
**Opting Out Of Marketing E-mail Messages.**   
With your consent, we will send you e-mail offers available to Members. You may opt-out of receiving marketing e-mail messages from the Web Site either when you register with the Web Site or at a later date. To opt-out of receiving e-mail after registration, you may either:   
1) click on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any commercial e-mail you receive and follow the instructions on-screen (you may do so anytime after receipt of the e-mail),

You will still continue to receive e-mail messages from other of our company-owned services that you have requested to receive e-mails from if you opt-out of receiving marketing messages from the LeadReact program. If you wish to opt-out of receiving e-mail from our other company-owned services, you need to contact customer support through the applicable service from which you are requesting to opt-out. On occasion, we may contact you with specific administrative notices that are required by law, regulation, or as needed to service your account (i.e. if we update our Privacy Statement). While you can elect to stop receiving commercial e-mail that we may send from our participating merchants through the LeadReact program, you cannot unsubscribe from these administrative messages.

**Delete/Deactivate from LeadReact.**   
You may stop participating in the LeadReact program at any time and/or delete your personal information from our database so as not to receive future communications from the Web Site. In order to deactivate and/or delete your information from the Web Site’s database, please send an e-mail to info@LeadReact.com with the words "Cancel My Membership" as the subject line. It may take up to 72 hours for us to process your request and any e-mail communications within the queue prior to your decision to deactivate will still be sent to you.

**Delete/Deactivate from Direct Marketing Partners Mailing Databases.**   
In order to be deleted from our Direct Marketing Partner’s databases and to stop receiving direct mail marketing from them, you must delete your www.LeadReact.com account and cease participation in the LeadReact program. It generally takes less than 30 days to remove your information from a Direct Marketing Partner’s list, but in certain instances it may take up to 60 days.

  
 **SECURITY**

  
We use a secure, encrypted connection (called an SSL connection) on all pages where you transmit sensitive data such as a credit card number, social security number or driver’s license number. Additionally, we have implemented procedural measures to safeguard your information. For example, only a very limited number of our employees have access to your personal information.  
Despite these security measures, we cannot guarantee that a third party might not unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or that users might not abuse or misuse your personal information that they may illegally collect from the Web Site. Therefore, although we believe that our practices exceed industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.

 **LINKS TO THIRD PARTY WEB SITES**

  
Through the Web Site, we may provide links to third-party web sites, such as those of our Clients. Each of these web sites have separate privacy and data-collection practices, which may differ from this Web Site, and we are not responsible for the actions or practices of these third parties, nor for the content on these web sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these web sites before providing your personally identifiable information.

 **DIGITAL IDENTIFIERS**

  
**Cookies.** We use "cookies" to personalize the LeadReact program to your interests, to ensure that only you can access your account, to facilitate the automatic log-in process and for web beacons (as described below in the "Web Beacons" section). The primary purpose of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, we use them to store your Automatic Log-in ID so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit www.LeadReact.com. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of www.LeadReact.com or the other web sites you visit.

We also review "log-file" data to monitor site performance and analyze traffic patterns and usage of our Web Site. Each time you visit the Web Site, our server automatically recognizes the following: 

  * Host origin of the request (your IP address or that of your ISP if using proxy servers) 
  * Referrer URL (the page you came from) 
  * Requested document (the page you're looking at) 
  * Your cookie 
  * Date and time of your visit 

This information, sometimes called log-file, is used to monitor Web Site performance and ensure that the LeadReact services function properly. It may also be appended to your personal profile so that we may further tailor the LeadReact program to your interests. If this data is appended to your personal file and you choose to share your personal information with a Client, the Client may also have access to this data.

Web Beacons. The Web Site’s pages and/or HTML e-mails may contain electronic images (called "web beacons", "single-pixel GIFs", or "action tags") that allow us to count users who have visited a certain web page or opened an e-mail, conduct research on partner and Client web sites for auditing purposes, or to access your www.LeadReact.com "cookie" to identify you when on third party web sites. Using web beacons allows us to personalize your experience by tailoring advertisements, updates, and other offers to your particular interests, and measuring the marketing effectiveness of our e-mail communications.

Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the web beacon resides. Information recorded through these web beacons may be used to report aggregate demographic or usage information about Members to our Clients, or user-level usage information to our Third Party Processors. The Web Site’s web pages may also contain web beacons placed there by third parties to help determine the effectiveness of our joint promotional or advertising campaigns. No personally identifiable information about you is shared with a Client or Third Party Processors except as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Statement.

**Third Party Ad Servers.**  
We may serve advertisements within our Web Site either ourselves or by allowing other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to do so. In addition, some of our advertisers may use the services of third-party ad networks. Some of these third-party ad networks may place a persistent cookie on your computer. Doing this allows the third-party ad network to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, third-party ad networks may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows a third-party ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. We do not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third-party ad servers or third-party ad networks. Those third-party ad networks that use persistent cookies may offer you a way to opt-out of ad targeting. To receive more information on React2media’s ad server please visit www.adjuggler.com . 

**CHILDREN/MINORS**

  
The Web Site will automatically block enrollment of any person once they indicate they are under the age of 13. If we later learn that a user is under the age of 13, we will terminate the account and delete the user's information. Inherent in the LeadReact program is the responsibility of parents and/or guardians to ensure that their children's privacy is protected.

 **LEGAL DISCLAIMER**

  
We disclaim and you agree that we will not be liable to you for any damages caused by acts or events beyond our reasonable control including, without limitation, acts of God, fires, floods, acts of terrorism, wars, civil disturbances, sabotage, accidents, labor disputes, governmental actions, and failures or delays of transportation that result in our disclosure of your personally identifiable information.

 **PRIVACY STATEMENT UPDATES AND SITE MAINTENANCE**

  
We reserve the right, at any time and without notice, to add to, update, change, modify or revise this Privacy Statement, the Site or our services simply by posting such change, update or modification on the Site. Any such addition, update, change, modification or revision will be effective immediately upon posting. If we materially change how we use your personal information, we will notify you via e-mail.

 **CONTACT INFORMATION**

  
If you have any questions about this Privacy Statement, our information-handling practices, or other aspects of privacy, please contact us by e-mail at info@react2media.com. |
