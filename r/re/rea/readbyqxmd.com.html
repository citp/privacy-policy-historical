			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
			<h3>QxMD Privacy Principles</h3>

			<p>QxMD wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy and therefore discloses its information and privacy practices.</p>

			<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should contact privacy@QxMD.com.</p>

			<p>"Read by QxMD" was created to enable physicians and other health care professionals to discover and share the best of the medical and scientific literature. By doing so, they can spend more time reading the literature and thereby make better clinical &amp; scientific decisions. In order to achieve this objective, QxMD provides an app and website that provides personalized content delivery and encourages registrants to share the content they have collected. QxMD wants health care professionals to feel comfortable sharing information and therefore, we work to ensure that the privacy and security of your personal and posted information is our primary concern. The following Privacy Policy provides details regarding how this is done.</p>

			<h3>Information Collected</h3>

			<p>QxMD collects personal information that you submit on the registration pages of the app and website (such as your name, email address, professional credentials, job description, country of practice, clinical/research interests and preferred scientific journals) and is the sole owner of said information. This type of required information is clearly identified when requested. You have the option to submit the credentials used to access personal or institutional journal subscriptions - by doing so, you will be able to access subscription content more easily. These credentials are stored in an encrypted fashion and are never shared with any other users or QxMD staff. All other optional personal information is provided entirely at your discretion.</p>

			<p>QxMD also collects information generated as you interact within our app &amp; website (such as your browser type, mobile device type, IP address, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, articles downloaded, article tags and time spent reading each article). Certain information of this type is stored using "cookies". A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user"s device or computer tied to information about that user. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can block or remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your internet browser"s "help" file. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our website.</p>

			<p>A number of features within the Read by QxMD app &amp; website allow you to post personal information and/or content that will be viewable by other users. As such, when posting article titles, article comments or article tags, you should not reveal anything that you want to keep private. Be aware that any personally identifying information posted on the site may be used to contact you.</p>

			<h3>Continuing Medical Education</h3>

			<p>When you elect to collect Continuing Medical Education (CME) or Continuing Education (CE) credit for your searches and reading behavior, you are asked to provide personally identifiable information such as your name, zip code and NPI.  In addition to personally identifiable information, aggregated non-personally identifiable information about the activities undertaken by CME/CE participants is recorded.  Information that you provide in connection with your participation in CME activities, either when registering or requesting credit, may be used as follows:</p>

			<p>QxMD partners with educational organizations accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME) to provide continuing education to physicians.  Your personally identifiable information is shared with our CME partner(s) who certify CME/CE activities offered through Read, as necessary for their fulfillment of their reporting obligations to the ACCME and other accrediting bodies. These reports may include personally identifiable information about you and credits issued to you, for the purpose of maintaining records and contacting you about additional CME opportunities.</p>

			<p>QxMD may use personally identifiable information, including registration information and evaluation data, in assessing educational needs and evaluating its educational activities.</p>

			<h3>Use of Information Collected</h3>

			<p>When you register on the "Read by QxMD" app or website, the information you provide forms the basis of your personal profile. This information is stored by QxMD primarily to provide you with personalized content delivery and facilitate interactions amongst other users of the Read by QxMD app and website. Data is stored as long as you are a registered user of our service, but removed upon your request.</p>

			<p>A secondary use of this information is to allow QxMD to target specific advertising to you. For example, a member that identifies his/herself as an ophthalmologist may receive specific advertisements that differ from those that appear to a member identified as a neurologist. At no point will the advertiser have access to information that will enable them to personally identify you.</p>

			<p>We use Google analytics to track anonymized user data on how the app and website are used. This data is used for internal review and to optimize the user experience.</p>

			<p>We may share some kinds of personally identifiable information with third parties as described below.</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Other Companies:</strong> We have strategic relationships with other companies who offer products and services. When you are interacting with one of these companies, a different privacy policy may apply and will be presented to you at such time.</li>

				<li><strong>Market Research:</strong> From time to time, we may invite you to participate in sponsored or unsponsored market research surveys. We may provide aggregate information from the survey results to third parties including the survey sponsor, if applicable. If you receive payment for participating in a sponsored survey, we may be required to provide the sponsor with personally identifiable information about you for its recordkeeping and regulatory reporting purposes. We will not provide any sponsor with your survey responses on an identifiable basis unless we obtain your consent prior to your participation in the survey. If you participate in a survey administered by a third party market research company, this company may identify you when you participate in the survey. We require these companies to agree that they will not provide the survey sponsor with personally identifiable information about you based on your participation in the survey, nor will they market to you based on such participation.</li>

				<li><p><strong>Sponsored Content:</strong> When you use Ready by QxMD, you may be presented with advertisements, promoted research and/or opportunities to engage in industry-sponsored informational programs consisting of sponsor-selected materials. All sponsored content and advertisements will be identified to you by the label Promoted, Advertisement, Information from Industry, Sponsored or some similar designation indicating that the content has been selected by a third-party sponsor.</p>

				<p>When you choose to engage with sponsored content, you may be asked to provide personally identifiable information which may be used to supplement information about you that we have already received during member registration.</p>

				The personally identifiable information that you provide when you engage with sponsored content will be used to provide the services you have requested or authorized, respond to your questions, provide you the specific services you select and to send you emails about new programs and selected information from our sponsors as it relates to your specialty or area of clinical practice. You may also receive invitations to engage with other sponsored content from the same sponsor. When you are exposed to sponsored content or an advertisement through the Services, QxMD may identify you by name to the sponsor. We may also provide the sponsor with your specialty and country where you reside, based on your registration profile. We will not provide a sponsor with your personal contact information such as email or postal address. We are not responsible for how the sponsor and its agents use your information and manage your privacy. Further, we may use non-personally identifiable information for research purposes, and we may provide this information in the aggregate to third parties.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Protection of Information Collected</h3>

			<p>QxMD follows generally accepted industry standard security measures to protect your information. To ensure that your personal information is protected, QxMD relies on Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information that you input. SSL is the industry standard used to protect sensitive and personal information as it passes over the web. The Read by QxMD user content and data, including each user"s personal information, is hosted on a physically, electronically and administratively secure server. In order to access your account, we require that you create a password. If you believe your user information has been lost or stolen, please contact privacy@qxmd.com and we will respond within 10 business days.</p>

			<h3>Legal Disclaimer</h3>

			<p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our app or Web site.</p>

			<h3>Access to Information Collected</h3>

			<p>If you wish to modify your personal information or change/delete the optional information in your profile that is viewable by other users, you can do so at any time by logging onto the site and/or app and accessing your account.</p>

			<p>If you wish to remove your account from Read by QxMD database you can do so by contacting QxMD at privacy@QxMD.com. You will receive a response within 10 business days. Removed information may continue in backup servers for a reasonable period of time based on industry best practices but will no longer be viewable by other users. If you lose your password or believe it has been stolen, you can reset it via the website or app and a temporary password will be provided to your email on file.</p>

			<h3>External Emails</h3>

			<p>If you wish to subscribe to QxMD newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. At the footer of each email a link is provided to allow you a way to easily unsubscribe. When we have new personalized content that you have indicated you want to be alerted about, you will receive an email notification. You have the option to control if such emails are sent out.</p>

			<h3>Links</h3>

			<p>Within the Read by QxMD app and website there may be links to other websites that are posted or shared by other users. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by QxMD and, therefore QxMD cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of other websites.</p>

			<h3>Children and Parents</h3>

			<p>Read by QxMD is not designed for children, and certainly not for children less than 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information of children under 13 and will delete any information associated with underage users.</p>

			<h3>Business Transitions</h3>

			<p>In the event QxMD goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.</p>

			<h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>

			<p>QxMD reserves the right to revise or update this Privacy Policy at any time. In the event that significant changes are made, QxMD commits to advising all users at the time that any significant change is made. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page or app.</p>

			<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>

			<p>If you have any comments, questions or concerns regarding our privacy policy, please send a message to our privacy officer at privacy@QxMD.com.</p>
