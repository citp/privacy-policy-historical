**Our Approach to Privacy. Reunion.com respects your privacy.** Our staff, contractors and others who help us operate our web sites follow this policy on privacy and fair information practices for online activities of Reunion.com.

This Privacy Policy applies to information Reunion.com collects online through its web sites, networks, or other services owned by Reunion.com, Inc. ("Reunion.com") including Reunion.com, GoodContacts and other websites operated by us. We refer to these web sites as the "Reunion.com Sites."

While Reunion.com Sites each offer a different combination of services and tools from one site to another, this policy states Reunion.com’s company-wide Privacy Policy with regard to data-collection practices.

By registering as a member of a Reunion.com Site, you agree to accept this Privacy Policy and are aware that our policy may change over time as discussed below.

 **Overview of Our Policy**  
The security of your personal information is a high priority at Reunion.com. We maintain these web sites and all associated data with technical, administrative and physical safeguards to protect against loss, unauthorized access, destruction, misuse, modification and improper disclosure. No computer system or information can ever be fully protected against every possible hazard, but Reunion.com is committed to providing reasonable and appropriate security controls to protect our web sites and their information against foreseeable hazards.

The information you provide helps us, and our partners (including our service providers, advertisers and other partners) make the Reunion.com Sites more fun and useful for you. It also enables us to provide you updates about our services and special offers from our partners. When you become a registered member of our site, you may receive email or postal mail from Reunion.com.  If you have so elected, you may also receive email or postal mail from our partners.

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily provide information in public areas of a Reunion.com Site, such as the user profile pages, message boards, or people search, that information can be viewed and possibly used by others, both on the Reunion.com Sites and potentially on our Partners’ sites. We advise users not to disclose contact information, including phone number, email address, street address or instant messenger address ("Personally Identifiable information") within these public areas that they do not wish to share.  This information should instead be maintained in the appropriate email and contact information section of this site, which is protected under the terms of this privacy policy. 

**Changes to this Policy**  
This Privacy Policy is available to users on this page for you to read. This Privacy Policy may be updated and modified from time to time to reflect new features, services and options, as well as any other changes with regard to the use of personal information.

By registering as a member of a Reunion.com Site, you agree to accept this Privacy Policy and are aware that our policy may change over time. Continued use of the Reunion.com Site or other Reunion.com services will signify that you agree to these changes. **About Children**

We do this so we can better understand what you like and tailor the site to suit you better. At a minimum, we require your name, birth date, gender, email address and zip code. The more information you volunteer, the more we can tailor the site, updates, and promotions to your interests. We may engage third parties to perform analysis or data processing of our databases that involves access to this information in order to better provide you with the services for which you joined (in which case we will take measures to ensure that such parties are contractually required to keep the information confidential and not to use it other than in a manner that is necessary to perform their work for Reunion.com). 

We may also use or disclose your membership registration or other Personally Identifiable Information as follows:

If you choose to co-register with our partners and accept their terms of service, then you are automatically registered as a member of their select web sites and your Personally Identifiable Information is shared with those organizations. As a result, you may receive information from one of these web sites as any of their members would. We advise you to review their privacy and data collection policies for further information. We are not responsible for the use of your Personally Identifiable Information by any such service provider.
