<p><strong>Cookies And Other Technical Information</strong></p>
<p>We send “cookies” to your computer primarily to enhance your  online experience and to store visitors’ preferences, record which session  information, record user-specific information on what pages users access or  visit, alert visitors to new areas that we think might be of interest to them  when they return to our site, record past activity at a site in order to  provide better service when visitors return to our site, ensure that visitors  are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads, customize site content based on  visitors’ browser type or other information that the visitor sends. Cookies are files that can identify you as a  unique customer and store your personal preferences as well as technical  information (including click through and click stream data). Cookies can either be permanent (i.e., they  remain on your computer until you delete them) or temporary (i.e., they last  only until you close your browser).</p>

<p>We may also use “Web beacons” that monitor your use of our  sites. Web beacons are small strings of code that provide a method for  delivering a graphic image on a Web page for the purpose of transferring data,  such as the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer that downloaded the  page on which the Web beacon appears, the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the  page on which the Web beacon appears, the time the page containing the Web  beacon was viewed, the types of browser that fetched the Web beacon and the  identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that  server. When corresponding with you via HTML capable e-mail, Web beacons let us  know whether you received and opened our e-mail. </p>

<p>If you choose to furnish the site with personally  identifiable information, this information can be stored in or linked to other  data stored in the cookies/Web beacons.</p>

<p>By accepting this Privacy Policy, you specifically agree to  our use of cookies and Web beacons as described herein. </p>

Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more  information. However, there is certain information  on our site that can only be accessed in conjunction with cookies or similar  devices and you should be aware that disabling cookies or similar devices might  prevent you from accessing some of our content.</p>

<p>We try to limit our disclosures of personally identifiable  information that are users have not posted on our site to those that are  important to carrying on our business. For  example, if you choose to post content on our site (e.g., a “movie review”), we  may freely disclose to others that content, and any other information you have  provided to us, other than your e-mail address.</p>
<p>We may disclose personally identifiable information in  response to legal process--for example, in response to a court order or a  subpoena. We also may disclose such  information in response to a law enforcement agency’s request or where we  believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding  illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to  the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of use, or as  otherwise required by law. In addition, we may transfer information about you  if we are acquired by or merged with another company, or if our assets are  acquired by another entity. </p>
