<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Our site visitors’ privacy and trust are important to us. We provide this notice in order to make sure that your expectations and our practices are aligned, and that you are aware of your choices with regard to our use and disclosure of the information you provide to this site.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes the policies of Reed Construction Data (<strong><em>“RCD”</em></strong> or<strong><em> “we”</em></strong>), a subsidiary of Reed Elsevier Inc., regarding the collection, use, disclosure and protection of the following types of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information obtained when you (“<strong><em>you</em></strong><em>”</em><strong> </strong>or “<strong><em>User</em></strong>”) visit any of the following web sites of RCD <strong>ReedConstructionData.com, ReedConnect.com, ReedBulletin.com, SmartProjectNews.com, MeansCostworks.com, RSMeans.com, ReedPSP.com, DCNOnl.com, and JOCOnl.com</strong> web site (collectively, this “Site”).</li>
<li>Information obtained through e-mail communications with you related to the Site.</li>
</ul>
<p>This privacy policy does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other sources. Your use of this Site constitutes your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and your consent to any action we take with respect to your information in compliance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We may change the terms of this Privacy Policy, so Users are encouraged to review this page from time to time. Your continued use of this Site following the posting of changes to the Privacy Policy means that you accept the changes.</p>
<h4>Information We Collect and How We Collect It</h4>
<p>We require you to provide certain information about yourself if you register with this Site or request products and services. We also collect information when you participate in contests and surveys, when you respond to requests for feedback and when you submit postings to public areas of this Site (e.g., blogs, moderated discussions and bulletin boards).</p>
<p>The information we collect may include information from which you may be personally identified (“<strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong>”), such as name, postal address, telephone number, fax number and e-mail address, and certain business information such as employer name, occupation, job function, job title and buying information (e.g., preferences or history). We also will collect credit card and related information when you request a product or service (including, if applicable, registering for the Site) for which there is a charge. This Site only collects Personally Identifiable Information with your knowledge.</p>
<p>When you visit this Site, we may collect the IP address of your computer. We also use automatic data collection technology to record other information that identifies your computer and tracks your behavior on this Site. Methods used to collect this information may include “cookies” and “clear GIFs” (also known as “pixel tags” or “beacons”). A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Most browsers allow Users to block the receipt of cookies, but doing so may compromise your ability to use certain features of this Site. A clear GIF is a small graphic image, typically used in connection with cookies, that is placed on a web site or in an email message. A clear GIF can monitor certain user behavior, such as your usage of the web site, whether you opened an email message or whether you clicked on a URL in an email message. We do not collect Personally Identifiable Information in this way, but if you provide us with Personally Identifiable Information, we may associate that information with the information that is collected automatically.</p>
