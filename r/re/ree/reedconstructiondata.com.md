**Information We Collect and How We Collect It**

We require you to provide certain information about yourself if you register with the Sites or request products and services. We also collect information when you participate in contests and surveys, when you respond to requests for feedback, when you submit postings to public areas of the Sites (e.g., blogs, moderated discussions and bulletin boards) and when you log on to the Sites through social networks such as Facebook, or Twitter.

The information we collect may include information from which you may be personally identified (" **Personally Identifiable Information** "), such as name, postal address, telephone number, fax number and e-mail address, and certain business information such as employer name, occupation, job function, job title and buying information (e.g., preferences or history). We also will collect credit card and related information when you request a product or service (including, if applicable, registering for the Sites) for which there is a charge.

When you visit the Sites, we may collect the IP address of your computer. We also use automatic data collection technology to record other information that identifies your computer and tracks your behavior on the Sites. Methods used to collect this information may include “cookies” and “clear GIFs” (also known as “pixel tags” or “beacons”). A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Most browsers allow Users to block the receipt of cookies, but doing so may compromise your ability to use certain features of the Sites. A clear GIF is a small graphic image, typically used in connection with cookies, that is placed on a web site or in an email message. A clear GIF can monitor certain user behavior, such as your usage of the Sites, whether you opened an email message or whether you clicked on a URL in an email message. We do not collect Personally Identifiable Information in this way, but if you provide us with Personally Identifiable Information, we may associate that information with the information that is collected automatically.

Collection, use, disclosure and security of information collected by third parties are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties.
