<p>In accordance with data protection laws, we keep your personal information for as long as we need it for the purpose for which it was collected. However, if you request us to remove your personal information from our records, we will remove it within 3 working days.</p>
<p>As for data that does not necessarily personally identify you, such as our access logs showing which IP address requested which page, we keep that indefinitely. We do this to gain insights from the aggregate data, so that we can improve the service.</p>
<p>Revieworld Ltd is registered as a data controller under the Data Protection Act. In accordance with the <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/what_we_cover/data_protection/notification.aspx">Data Protection Act 1998</a> you are entitled to request details of the personal information we hold about you. We will try to comply with your request free of charge, but we may have to charge a fee for complying with your request. If you become aware that the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate, you may request that we amend it. Any requests should be made in writing to us at privacy@reevoo.com.</p>
<p><strong>What We Don’t Collect</strong></p>
<p>•	Credit card details: We do not have your credit card details. If you use our site to decide what to buy and where to buy it, and then click through to any of our retail partners’ websites, we do not see any of the personal information you enter on their site. If you write a review after having bought online at one of our retail partners’ sites, we do not get your credit card details from the partner. Hence, we never know your credit card details.</p>
<p>•	All search engine queries: We do not know all the things you search for on search engines. We only know what you searched for that made you land on one of our pages. We do not know what you searched for prior that. We look at the words that made you land on our site so that we can give you the best possible, relevant experience. We aggregate over all users landing on our site and analyse that to optimise our search engine rankings.</p>
<p>•	Information about children: We do not and will not knowingly request personal information from anyone under the age of 16. Any person who provides their personal information to Reevoo through this website represents that they are 16 years of age or older. We urge parents of children under 16 to monitor their children’s web usage.</p>
<p>•	Other websites: This privacy policy applies to websites and services that are owned and operated by Revieworld Ltd. We do not have any control over the websites of third parties that may be linked to from pages on our website, and we cannot be responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. We encourage you to check the applicable privacy policy of these sites before entering information on them.</p>
<p><strong>What We Share With Whom</strong></p>
<p>•	Reevoo.com users:  Information you have chosen to share with other reevoo.com users as per your preferences set on your account page, will be viewable by other users (e.g., on your profile page and elsewhere throughout the site). You are in control to protect your anonymity. We urge you to be careful with posting personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>•	Service Providers: We employ third party companies to perform site-related services (e.g., web hosting services, performance services, maintenance services, web analytics and improvement of the site’s features) or to assist us in analyzing how our site and services are used. These third parties have access to your personal information only for the purposes of performing these tasks on our behalf.</p>
<p>•	Business Partners: We will always anonymise your information when sharing it with business partners.</p>
<p>•	Law Enforcement and Government: We cooperate with law enforcement and government officials to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to law enforcement and government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process, to protect the property and rights of Revieworld Ltd, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop any activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical, inappropriate or legally actionable.</p>
<p><strong>How We Protect Your Information</strong></p>
<p>•	Anonymisation and encryption: When we store and process sensitive data such as email addresses, we make extensive efforts to protect that information from unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. These steps include the use of firewalls, network-layer encryption such as <span class="caps">SSL</span> and dedicated monitoring systems. We also limit access to personal information to only those employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.</p>
<p>•	No guarantee: No data transmissions over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure security on our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed.</p>
<p>•	Notification: If we learn of a security systems breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using this website or providing personal information to us you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues relating to your use of this website. We may post a notice on our website if a security breach occurs. We may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us at privacy@reevoo.com.</p>
<p>•	International visitors and customers: This website is hosted in the United Kingdom. International users will be submitting their data to the UK under the protection of UK laws.</p>
<p><strong>Changes and Updates</strong></p>
<p>•	Updates to this policy: We may occasionally update this policy. When we make substantial changes, we will say so on the homepage of the website for at least one week and also revise the effective date of the policy.</p>
<p>•	Change of control: If Reevoo is ever sold, merges with another entity, or files for bankruptcy, the information covered by this policy will be considered a Reevoo asset and may be transferred. We will ensure a message will be posted on Reevoo.com about the change of ownership, and give you an opportunity to object to the new owner having your details.</p>
<p>•	Your consent: Your continued use of this website constitutes your agreement to this privacy policy and any updates.</p>
<p><strong>Contacting Us</strong></p>
<p>If you have any questions, comments, or concerns about this privacy policy, please don’t hesitate to contact us on privacy@reevoo.com.
