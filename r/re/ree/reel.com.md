_How We Use Personally Identifiable Information_  
Reel.com uses your personally identifiable information to personalize your experience on our Web site and to contact you. 

Reel.com also compiles aggregate data from all of our customers to prepare internal reports about which Web pages are popular, how many total unique users visit our site, and different traffic patterns on the site. Reel.com does not combine your personally identifiable information with information about Web pages visited, purchases made, or any other clickstream data.

_Who We Disclose Personally Identifiable Information To_  
Reel.com will not sell, rent, trade, or disclose your personally identifiable information to anyone except as explained in this policy. Reel.com may disclose some personal information to outside companies who help Reel.com with the administration and delivery of newsletters, promotional games, trivia contests, and sweepstakes. For example, a company who administers a sweepstakes for us may use your e-mail address to update you on your status in the sweepstakes. Or, our newsletters may be distributed by another company that will use your e-mail or shipping address for delivery. We do not allow these outside companies to use this information for any reason other than ones we specifically authorize. 

The Reel.com Web site contains links to other Web sites. Although we **do not** provide any personally identifiable information to these companies, we cannot guarantee your privacy once you leave the Reel.com Web site. Reel.com is not responsible for the privacy policies, practices, or content of Web sites with links on our site. Also, shopping services for our customers are now provided by Amazon.com through a link on our site. When you make a purchase, you will enter your personally identifiable information directly on the Amazon.com Web site. Reel.com's privacy policy will not apply on Amazon.com's Web site. You should review Amazon.com's privacy policy if you choose to make purchases. 

Aggregate statistical data gathered from customers, but NOT personally identifiable information, may be shared with our [Associate Program](https://web.archive.org/web/20021207062640id_/http%3A//www.reel.com/reel.asp%3Fnode%3Dabout/reel.asp?node=affiliates) associates in order to calculate referral information. Reel.com may also disclose your personal information to law enforcement personnel, government officials, or others when we, in our sole discretion, believe that disclosure is necessary to prevent violations of the law, injury to person or property, or any harm to Reel.com or others.

**Children**   
_Our Policy For Guests Under Age 18_

These tools may also prevent children from disclosing online their name, address, and other personal information without parental permission.
