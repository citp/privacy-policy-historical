**Privacy policy**

 The policies below are applicable to [www.rbk.com](http://www.rbk.com/).

 Privacy refers to information that we at Reebok International Limited. ("Reebok") gather about you and the use that we make of it in the course of our business.

 Reebok collects personally identifying information only during contests, sweepstakes and site membership registration. In addition, information is collected in certain portions of the site in which guests specifically and knowingly provide that information along with content submissions, community postings (i.e., chat or bulletin boards), suggestions, voting or otherwise. Reebok may use this information for editorial and feedback purposes (to the extent that this is explained when guests provide the information) and for marketing and promotional purposes. Reebok does not share this information with other companies unless otherwise disclosed during collection. 

 In the event Reebok plans to post any of this information on a site, guests are provided prior notification and can prevent it by written request.  A guest can also prevent us using his or her personal information for marketing and promotional purposes by written request.  Please address these requests to:

 Guests' e-mail addresses are never posted on [www.rbk.com](http://www.rbk.com/).

  **Policies for Individuals 16 and Under:**

 Children under 16 years of age should not submit or post information on the Reebok website, nor should they participate in any online competition, without their parent's or guardian's consent.

 No information collected from children 16 years of age or under is used for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever, either inside or outside Reebok.

 Reebok recognises that families are concerned about privacy and especially about the privacy of their children online. Reebok, its staff, contractors, and others who help us operate our website follow this policy on privacy and fair information practices for online activities of Reebok.  Reebok respects the requirements of local law.

 Reebok encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in the interactive activities offered on the sites.

 **Use of Cookies:**

 Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes while at the site. Cookies make web-surfing easier by saving your passwords, purchases, and preferences for you. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and you'll find cookies at most major web sites. 

 Reebok does not use information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes, nor is the information shared with any third parties whatsoever. Reebok does not use cookies to identify individuals or to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie.

 Cookies help make www.rbk.com better by showing how and when guests use the site. They do not, however, gather user specific information about persons who use the site. Many content improvements and updates are based on data such as total number of visitors and pages viewed.  This statistical information is most easily tracked with cookies.

 You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers. These cookies are sent from third-party computers and are subject to the above-stated policies. 

 Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies. However, it is possible that some areas of the site will not function properly if you do so.

 Reebok reserves the right to change this policy at any time by notifying guests of the existence of a new privacy policy. You can send mail with any further questions to us at:
