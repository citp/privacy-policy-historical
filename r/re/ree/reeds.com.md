_PLEASE NOTE: REEDS Jewelers, Inc., is not associated with any other jewelry chain or store using the name REEDS or REEDS Jewelers._

### What Information Does REEDS Collect?

REEDS collects information you provide to us to serve your needs. For example, if you place an order, or simply register on our site, you will provide to us your name, address, email address, phone number and credit card information. Of course, if you are placing an order, you will need to know the product(s) you wish to purchase. 

REEDS also collects information you voluntarily submit when participating in one of our various services, promotions, programs or surveys. From your transactions and other interactions with us, we obtain information concerning the specific products or services you purchase or use. 

REEDS also receives information about you from other companies, including, but not limited to information on your creditworthiness for private label credit card offers and products you may be interested in purchasing. 

REEDS is a highly ethical company and requires the highest standard of conduct from our employees and business partners. As members of the Jewelers of America and other distinguished industry organizations, we adhere to the Direct Marketing Association's Guidelines for Ethical Business Practice, Shopping and Consumer Rights and the DMA's Privacy Promise. 

### How Does REEDS Use The Information Collected?

REEDS may use the information collected as follows: 

  * to complete your purchase transactions and provide the services you request; 
  * to send you catalogs and other offerings through the mail; 
  * to contact you about the status of your orders; 
  * to identify your product and service preferences, so that you can be informed of new or additional products, services, and promotions that might be of interest to you; 
  * to notify you of product recalls or provide other information concerning products you have purchased; and 
  * to improve our merchandise selections, customer service, and overall customer shopping experience. 



See third-party advertising below. 

### What Information Does REEDS Share with Others?

**Affiliated Partners** : REEDS may share the collected information with affiliated partner companies and licensees in order to deliver contractually designated products and services. For example, in some cases we may use service provider partners to help us perform some of these tasks, including, but not limited to, processing or fulfilling your orders or performing customer service, business analyses or quality control (e.g., we use UPS to deliver most of our packages to our customers), and consequently we may share your contact information with these service providers. In such cases, we will require these service providers to enter into agreements with us regarding the confidential handling of your information. We may also provide your contact information to your credit card issuer or to credit card processors for their purposes in processing your order. When you make a purchase through the REEDS.com web site, or register with the REEDS.com web site, you will provide us with an email address where we, or these service providers, may contact you for the purposes described in this paragraph. 

**Legal Disclosures** : In the highly unlikely event REEDS is required to disclose customer information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws, REEDS will make such disclosure. In the event the ownership of all or a part of a business within REEDS Jewelers were to change, customer information pertinent to that business's operations would likely be transferred to, or licensed for use by, the new owner. 

**Third Party Offers** : If REEDS chooses to offer you selected third party products and services that we think would be of benefit to you and you accept the offer, REEDS would supply this third party firm with just the personal information necessary for this partner to deliver the offer, product or service to you. 

**REEDS Credit Card Account** : We may share your information with the bank that issues REEDS credit card accounts, World Financial Network National Bank. (You can read their privacy policy at <https://onlineaccess.mycreditcard.cc/REEDS?Action=Privacy.jsp>.)

This information is not shared outside of this arrangement.

We will make every effort to implement any choice you make as soon as possible, but you should allow approximately three months for mailing change requests to be fully implemented due to lead times with external vendors on printed materials.

Once you have unsubscribed, you will be removed from receiving future email solicitations, apart from those that have already been processed before this request was received. Note that unsubscribing from promotional emails will not affect your receipt of order status emails which will still be provided to you after purchasing online at REEDS.com. 

### Are REEDS Credit Cards Available?

Yes. You can apply for a REEDS credit card account issued by World Financial Network National Bank to receive special offers and participate in exclusive brand benefits, including the REEDS Rewards program, in which you accumulate points to spend at REEDS for every dollar threshold you meet.

### Does REEDS Send Unsolicited Promotional emails?

No. REEDS only sends marketing email offers to customers who have explicitly requested them. To request occasional promotional email offers, notifying you of special deals, web-only offers, product previews, and in-store events for stores near you, you may sign up for Email Offers on this web site, or call, fax or write us at the address listed above.

Registered web site users who have purchased from REEDS.com will receive standard order status communications, such as order confirmation, shipping dates, etc. via email at the registered email account the user has designated. Your choice to opt-in or opt-out of promotional emails will not affect the order status and registration service. 

### How Does REEDS Safeguard the Information Collected?

REEDS protects against unauthorized disclosures by limiting access to only those REEDS employees who need the information to do their jobs. REEDS employees are trained about their responsibility to protect our customers' privacy. We limit the information we provide to outside companies to only the information we believe is appropriate to enable them to carry out their responsibilities under our contracts or to offer you products and services we think might be of interest to you. We contractually require that the information provided be used only for the specifically authorized purpose and that its confidentiality be maintained. 

### Is My Online Transaction Secure?

Yes. It is very secure. The use of the latest cutting edge technology ensures that your shopping experience will be safe and secure. We encrypt your personal information, including your name, address, and credit card number when transmitting over the Internet using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) security software. We constantly update our security procedures and enhance our site to meet the very latest encryption standards. All of your sensitive information is scrambled before, during and after your order is placed on our site. 

You may notice an unbroken key  or a closed lock  at the bottom of the page when you enter our "check-out" page. This means that your browser has opened a secure connection with our site! You can also check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https." 

**PLEASE NOTE THAT NORMAL E-MAIL (such as using the "Contact Us" form on REEDS.com or sending an email via your home email service) IS NOT ENCRYPTED AND THUS IS NOT A SECURE MEANS FOR TRANSMITTING CREDIT CARD INFORMATION OR ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION YOU WISH TO KEEP PRIVATE AND SECURE.**

### Does REEDS Use HTML Cookies?

REEDS uses HTML cookies to enhance the browsing and shopping experience on the REEDS.com web site. Cookies are small files or records that we place on your computer's hard drive to collect information about your activities on the REEDS site. **There are absolutely no personally identifiable pieces of information stored anywhere in these cookie files, and they are used solely by REEDS to enhance your shopping experience and to allow us to serve you better in the future.** These cookies transmit information back to the REEDS web site computers; these computers are, generally speaking, the only computers which are authorized to read such information. The information captured makes it possible for us (i) to speed navigation, keep track of items in your shopping cart, and provide you with custom tailored content; (ii) to remember information you gave to us so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit the REEDS site; (iii) to monitor the effectiveness of some of our marketing email campaigns; and (iv) to monitor total number of visitors, pages viewed, and the total number of visitors served. 

Most people do not even know that cookies are being placed on their computers when they visit the REEDS.com site or most other web sites because web browsers are typically set to accept cookies. You can choose to have your browser warn you every time a cookie is being sent to you or you can turn off cookie acceptance altogether. 

Note that if you refuse cookies, you will be unable to order from the REEDS.com site using the Shopping Cart. You will still be able to browse our selection, but the order process requires that your Web Browser be set to allow cookies. Moreover, by not allowing cookies, your overall Internet browsing experience could be adversely affected. 

### Does REEDS Aggregate Information?

REEDS Jewelers has carefully selected a company, Coremetrics, that will assist us in better understanding your use of our site. Coremetrics collects information on our site through first-party data collection by placing cookies on your computer. The information that is collected through these cookies educates us on such things as search engine referral, how you navigate through our site, responses to email offers, unique visitor identification, and product browsing and purchasing information. REEDS.com does not allow Coremetrics to collect credit card, username or password information. The information that is collected by Coremetrics is analyzed by Coremetrics and is sent to REEDS.com through a secure web connection. The analyzed data will allow for REEDS.com to better understand your interests and needs in our web site and how to better serve those interests and provide you with more personalized product offerings. Our contract with Coremetrics prohibits them from using any of the data collected on our site for any other purpose or match it against any other information in its possession. Coremetrics is required to maintain all information collected and its analysis in confidence. As a visitor to REEDS.com, you have the choice to deactivate the ability of Coremetrics to analyze your browsing and purchasing behavior on our site. You may also choose to continue to benefit from the improved shopping experience that the Coremetrics analysis allows us to provide to you, but you may still maintain anonymity.
