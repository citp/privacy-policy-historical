### What Personal Information Does REEDS Jewelers Share with Others?

**Affiliated Partners** : REEDS Jewelers may share the collected Personal Information with affiliated partner companies and licensees in order to deliver contractually designated products and services.

### Does REEDS Jewelers use Third-Party Advertising?

REEDS Jewelers uses third-party service providers to place Internet advertisements (banners or links) on our behalf. These advertising service providers may collect non-identifiable information about your visits to our Sites, and your interactions with our products and services. Such non-identifiable information does not include your name, address, e-mail address or other personal information. The information is collected through the use of cookies and pixel tags (also known as action tags), which are industry-standard technology used by most major websites.

In addition to the information about your visits to our website, our service providers may also use the information about your visits to other websites to target advertisements for products and services available from REEDS Jewelers.

**Legal Disclosures** : In the unlikely event REEDS Jewelers is required to disclose Personal Information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws, REEDS Jewelers will make such disclosure. In the event the ownership of all or a part of a business within REEDS Jewelers were to change, Personal Information pertinent to that business's operations would likely be transferred to, or licensed for use by, the new owner.

**Third Party Offers** : If REEDS Jewelers chooses to offer you selected third party products and services that we think would be of benefit to you and you accept the offer, REEDS Jewelers would supply this third party firm with just the Personal Information necessary for this partner to deliver the offer, product or service to you.

A web beacon is a small string of code that represents a clear graphic image and is used in conjunction with a cookie. When you visit our Sites, we may use both a session and a persistent cookie. This REEDS-placed cookie may contain information (such as a unique user ID) that is used to track your usage of our website and in some cases, your e-mail address. Your e-mail address is only saved in this REEDS-placed cookie if you register with us. The REEDS-placed cookie is also used for the auto-saved shopping cart so that when a user returns, the contents of their shopping cart are automatically retrieved. A web beacon allows us to capture certain additional types of information about a visitor's actions on a website, such as a visitor's cookie number, the time, date, duration and number of page views, a description of the page where the Web beacon is placed, and details about any items that were purchased.

If you have not saved your information with or ordered from us, we may monitor and maintain information about your use of our website in a manner that does not identify you.

For example, Social Plugins allow Facebook to show you and your friends' "Likes" on our product pages if you are logged into Facebook while shopping at REEDS.com. REEDS Jewelers does not receive or control any of the content from Facebook Social Plugins. To remove a Facebook "Like" through REEDS.com, place your cursor in the "grayed out" Like button and click on the "X" that appears. This removes the "Like" from your Facebook Page, as well as from REEDS Jewelers’ websites. You can also delete comments made while at REEDS.com from your Facebook Page.

If you choose to do this, we may collect information necessary to facilitate social interactions such as friend lists, birthday, check-ins, basic profile information and your profile picture but only if the privacy settings you and your friends set within Facebook or the other social media interfaces allow it. We will use the information we collect to create and facilitate an interactive social experience and to bring you products, services and programs from REEDS Jewelers.
