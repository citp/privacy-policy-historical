# Privacy policy and cookie policy - Retro to Go

**Privacy policy and cookie policy**

At Retro To Go, I have always taken your privacy seriously and have never sought to access any more information than is necessary for the running of the site functionally and commercially. However, it light of GDPR coming into play, I wanted to take the opportunity to add as much clarity / transparency as I can to both my Privacy Policy and in relation to cookies on the site.

The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you what personally identifiable information may be collected and how it may be used. This statement only applies to this website.

 **Information collected and how it is used:**

 **1\. Information voluntarily submitted to the website:**  
We may collect personal information from you such as your name or email address. For example, you may submit information to the website by leaving a comment, subscribing to our newsletter, or getting in touch via the ‘contact us’ page.

 **2\. Information collected from others:**  
We may receive information about you from other sources, for example if you link your website, profile or leave a comment. If you opt to do so, your profile may be displayed at the side of your name.

 **3\. Automatically-Collected Information:**  
We automatically collect certain information about you and the device when you access the website. For example, we will log your IP address, operating system type, browser type, referring website, pages you viewed, and the dates/times when you accessed the site. We may also collect information about actions you take when using the website, such as links clicked.

 **4\. Cookies:**  
We may log information using cookies, which are small data files stored on your browser by the website. We may use both session cookies, which expire when you close your browser, and persistent cookies, which stay on your browser until deleted, to provide you with a more personalised experience on the website.

 **How your information is used:**

The information collected could be used in the following ways:  
To operate and maintain our website.  
To send you promotional information, such as newsletters. Note that every email we send has an opt-out / unsubscribe.  
To respond to your comments or inquiries.  
To track and measure advertising on the website  
To protect, investigate, and deter against unauthorised or illegal activity. Essentially to keep you and fellow users safe.

 **Third party use of information**

We may share your information with third parties when you explicitly authorise us to share your information.  
Additionally, the website may use third- arty service providers to service various aspects of the Website. Each third party service provider’s use of your personal information is dictated by their respective privacy policies.

 **We currently use the following third party providers:**

Google Analytics may capture your IP address, but no other personal information is captured by Google Analytics. Note that for this site, I anonymise data for added protection.

 **Anonymous data**

From time to time, we may use anonymous data, which does not identify you alone, or when combined with data from other parties. This type of anonymous data may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses. Examples of this anonymous data may include analytics or information collected from cookies.
