For example, you may be required to provide us with Contact Information or Relationship Information in order to register for certain services. </p><p>We collect Transaction Information when you use our Site. For example, we may track the coupons you view, submit or redeem, and the comments you make to the forums, bulletin boards, discussion groups, chat rooms or other methods of communication that may be offered on or through the Sites from time to time "<strong><em>Communities</em></strong>"), or to those related to our social media pages or accounts. We use cookies and related technologies to collect information about your computer and your interaction with the Sites and our business partner websites. You can read more about cookies and other technologies in the <a href="#cookies-and-related-technologies">Cookies and Related Technologies</a> section.</p><p>We also collect Transaction Information if you contact us via telephone, email, text, postal mail, social media interaction, or other methods of communication, such as for customer support purposes.</p><p>If you use a social media platform, a mobile device or other third-party method of communication to interact with RetailMeNot or the Sites, that application may have a specific privacy statement that governs the use of Personal Information related to that application. For example, if you use a RetailMeNot mobile application and your mobile device's settings allow it, we may collect Location Information from your device. Our application may be designed to collect information even if you are not logged into one of the Sites. If you have questions about the security and privacy settings of your mobile device, please refer to instructions from your mobile service provider or the manufacturer of your device to learn how to adjust your settings.</p><p>We may receive additional Personal Information from third parties. For example, we may collect Personal Information from third parties to enhance other information we have about you, to help us better understand you, and to otherwise enhance the Sites or RetailMeNot services.</p><h2 id="how-rmn-uses-personal-information">3. How RetailMeNot Uses Personal Information</h2><p>RetailMeNot uses Personal Information to:</p><ul> <li>Operate and improve our Sites;</li> <li>Provide users with coupons for products and services from participating merchants, including coupons based on variables such as stated and anticipated user interests, personal characteristics, or location;</li> <li>Evaluate eligibility of users for certain coupons, products or services;</li> <li>Provide card-linked offers</li> <li>Evaluate the types of coupons, products or services that may be of interest to users;</li> <li>Track redemption of coupons and perform other analytics;</li> <li>Provide user support, including to our merchants or business partners;</li> <li>Fulfill requests for RetailMeNot services;</li> <li>Communicate and provide additional information that may be of interest to you about RetailMeNot and our merchants and business partners, such as RetailMeNot news, special offers and coupons, announcements, and marketing materials;</li> <li>Send you reminders, technical notices, updates, security alerts and support and administrative messages service bulletins, or marketing;</li> <li>Provide advertisements to you through the Sites, third-party sites, email messages, text messages, applications, or other methods of communication;</li> <li>Administer surveys, sweepstakes, contests, or other promotional activities or events sponsored by us or our partners; </li> <li>Manage our everyday business needs such as Site administration, forum management, analytics, fraud prevention, Terms of Use or to comply with the law; and</li> <li>Allow you to apply for a job, post a video or sign up for special offers from third parties through the Site.</li></ul><h2 id="when-and-why-rmn-discloses-personal">4. When and Why RetailMeNot Discloses Personal Information</h2><p>We may share your Personal Information as required or permitted by law as described below:</p><ul> <li>With affiliated companies (e.g., subsidiaries and other companies owned by or controlled by RetailMeNot) who may only use the Personal Information for the purposes described in Section 3 above;</li> <li>With our service providers that provide services for us such as sending emails on our behalf, processing payments, and facilitating card-linked offers. Our service providers are bound by law or contract to protect Personal Information and are only allowed to use the Personal Information in accordance with the terms of our service agreements with them;</li> <li>Merchants, but only to the extent you have redeemed a coupon offered by the merchant, or participated in an offer, contest or other activity sponsored or offered through RetailMeNot on behalf of the merchant; </li> <li>RetailMeNot business partners or advertisers, as part of an offer, contest, or other activity that is provided by or in conjunction with RetailMeNot and its business partners and in which you have elected to participate. For example, if you are referred to RetailMeNot from a business partner's website or through an invitation facilitated by or in conjunction with a RetailMeNot business partner, RetailMeNot may provide that business partner with Contact Information and Transactional Information to validate the referral and to support the terms of the relationship between RetailMeNot and the business partner, which may allow such business partner to contact you directly and to advertise to you;</li> <li>To effect a merger, acquisition, or otherwise; to support the sale or transfer of business assets; to enforce our rights or protect our property; to protect the rights, property or safety of others, investigate fraud, respond to a government request; or as needed to support auditing, compliance, and corporate governance functions. We may also disclose Personal Information to defend ourselves in litigation or a regulatory action, and when required or advised to do so by law, such as in response to a subpoena, or similar legal process, including to law enforcement agencies, regulators, and courts in the United States and other countries where we operate. If RetailMeNot is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or prominent notice on one or more of our Sites of any change in ownership or uses of your Personal Information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personal Information; or</li> <li>With your consent.<p></p>We encourage RetailMeNot merchants and business partners to adopt and post privacy policies. However, the use of your Personal Information by such parties is governed by the privacy policies of such parties and is not subject to our control. <p></p><p>We may also disclose information about you that is not personally identifiable. For example, we may provide our merchants, business partners, or other third parties with reports that contain aggregated and statistical data about our users.</p></li></ul><h2 id="cookies-and-related-technologies">5. Cookies and Related Technologies</h2><p>When you use our Sites, we collect certain information by automated or electronic means, using technologies such as cookies, pixel tags and web beacons, browser analysis tools, and web server logs. As you use our Sites and applications, your browser and devices communicate with servers operated by us, our business partners and services providers to coordinate and record the interactivity and fill your requests for services and information..</p><p>The information from cookies and related technology is stored in web server logs and also in web cookies kept on your computers or mobile devices, which are then transmitted back to our Sites by your computers or mobile devices. These servers are operated and the cookies managed by us, our business partners or our service providers.</p><p>For example, when you visit our Sites, RetailMeNot and our service providers may place cookies on your computers or mobile devices. Cookies allow us to recognize you when you return, and track and target your interests in order to provide a customized experience. They also help us provide a customized experience and help us to detect certain kinds of fraud. A "<strong><em>cookie</em></strong>" is a small amount of information that a web server sends to your browser that stores information about your account, your preferences, and your use of the Sites. Some cookies contain serial numbers that allow us to connect your Site activity with other information we store about you in your profile or as related to your interactions with the Sites.</p><p>Some cookies are temporary, whereas others may be configured to last longer. "<strong><em>Session</em></strong>" cookies are temporary cookies used for various reasons, such as to manage page views. Your browser usually erases Session cookies once you exit your browser. "<strong><em>Persistent</em></strong>" cookies are more permanent cookies that are stored on your computers or mobile devices even beyond when you exit your browser. We use Persistent cookies for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided (such as your user id if you asked to be remembered), and storing your preferences.</p><p>Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on website pages or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed specific actions. When you access these pages or open email messages, the pixel tags and web beacons generate a notice of that action to us, or our service providers. These tools allow us to measure response to our communications and improve our web pages and promotions.</p><p>We collect many different types of information from cookies and other technologies. For example, we may collect information from the devices you use to access our Sites, your operating system type or mobile device model, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone of your device. Browsers routinely send these types of information to web servers. Our server logs also record the Internet Protocol ("<strong><em>IP</em></strong>") addresses of the devices you use to interact with the Sites. An IP address is a unique identifier that devices use to identify and communicate with each other on the Internet. We may also collect information about the website you were visiting before you came to our Site and the website you visit after you leave our Site, if this information is supplied to us by your browser.</p><p>In many cases, the information we collect using cookies and other tools is used in non-identifiable ways, without any reference to Personal Information. For example, we use information we collect about Site users to optimize our Sites and understand its traffic and usage patterns. In other cases, we associate the information we collect using cookies and related technologies with Personal Information. In that case, this Privacy Statement governs how we use that information.</p><p>Additionally, if the settings on your location-aware device allow us to receive Location Information, we will collect that automatically. If we associate Location Information with other Personal Information, this Privacy Statement governs how we would use that information too.</p><p>RetailMeNot has relationships with third party advertising companies to place advertisements on our behalf onto other websites, and to perform tracking and reporting functions for our Sites and our advertisements. We do not share Personal Information with third party advertising companies; however, these third parties may automatically collect information about your visit to our Sites and other websites, your IP address, your ISP and the browser you use to visit this Site. They do this by using cookies, clear gifs and other technologies. Information collected may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of our Site and the other websites tracked by these third parties. This Privacy Statement does not cover the collection methods or use of the information collected by these third parties, and RetailMeNot is not responsible for cookies or clear gifs in third party ads. We encourage you to review the privacy policies or statements of these third party advertising companies to learn more about their use of cookies and other technologies. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by third party advertisers, please visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org</a>.</p><p>We use Google Analytics to help us understand how visitors interact with our website and to help improve our user experience.</p><h2 id="your-choices">6. Your Choices</h2><p>We think that you benefit from a more personalized experience when we know more about you and the kinds of coupons you like. However, you can limit the information you provide to RetailMeNot, and you can limit the communications that RetailMeNot sends to you.</p><h4>Email</h4><p>You can manage your email preferences by logging into the Community at www.retailmenot.com/community and clicking on the "Email Preferences" link. You can also manage your subscriptions by following subscription management instructions contained in the commercial messages that we send you. You may choose to subscribe to some types of messages, and may choose to unsubscribe from others. You may also update your subscription preferences from time to time. If you wish to opt out of receiving offers directly from RetailMeNot merchants or business partners, you can follow the opt-out instructions in the emails that they send you.</p><h4>Cookies</h4><p>You may manage how your browser handles cookies and related technologies by adjusting its privacy and security settings. Browsers are different, so refer to instructions related to your browser to learn about cookie-related and other privacy and security settings that may be available. You can opt-out of being targeted by certain third party advertising companies online at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp</a>.</p><h4>Mobile</h4><p>If you access any of our Sites through a mobile device or mobile browser, you may manage how your Location Information is shared with RetailMeNot. For example, our mobile device applications provide you the ability to opt-out of sharing your Location Information. You may also manage how your mobile device or mobile browser handles cookies and related technologies by adjusting your mobile device privacy and security settings. Please refer to instructions provided by your mobile service provider or the manufacturer of your device to learn how to adjust your mobile device and mobile browser settings.</p><h4>Connecting through Social Networks</h4><p>You may manage the sharing of certain Personal Information when you register with us through a social media platform or application, such as through Facebook Connect. Please refer to the privacy settings of the social media platform or application to determine how you may adjust our permissions and manage the interactivity between RetailMeNot and your social media account. By registering with RetailMeNot through a social media platform, you grant RetailMeNot permission to access all of the elements of your social network profile information that you have made available to be shared and to use it in accordance with the social network's terms of use and this Privacy Statement.</p><h4 id="facebook-app">RetailMeNot App on Facebook</h4><p>The RetailMeNot App on Facebook (the “App”) provides two separate privacy controls that allow you to control sharing of your actions taken from within the App, such as selecting a favorite store or saving a coupon. First, you can adjust the App's settings in order to control sharing outside of the App (e.g., with other Facebook users who have not authorized the App themselves). Second, you can adjust the App's sharing button to control sharing throughout Facebook (e.g., with all Facebook users regardless of whether they have authorized the App themselves). Both of these controls are explained in more detail below.</p><div style="text-decoration:underline; text-align:center;">The App's Settings</div><p>When you authorize the App, you may select who on Facebook can see activity created by your actions outside of the App. The default setting is “Friends”. The “Friends” setting means that your activity within the App may be shared outside of the App with your friends. For example, some of your friends may see, on your activity feed, newsfeed, ticker, and elsewhere on Facebook, the coupons you save or redeem.</p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto; display:block;" src="http://t.rmncdn.com/ops/fb-auth-dialog.png"><p>During the authorization step, pictured above, you can change this setting to “Public”, “Only Me” or “Custom”. Alternatively, at any time after authorizing the App you can update your settings in Facebook by visiting Account Settings &gt; Apps &gt; RetailMeNot &gt; Edit and changing the selection for "Posts on your behalf:"</p><p>Please note that the “Only Me” setting means that your activity within the App will not be shared outside of the App with other Facebook users. However, the App will continue to post your activity on a unique profile page that is shared with your friends who have authorized the App themselves unless you turn off the App's sharing button as explained below.</p><div style="text-decoration:underline; text-align:center;">The App's Sharing Button</div><p>When you begin using the RetailMeNot App on Facebook, a unique profile page is created to display your actions taken from within the App. This profile page is automatically shared with any of your friends who have also authorized the App. The App's sharing button allows you to control (i) what activities are posted to your unique profile page and (ii) what activities are shared outside of the App.</p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto; display:block;" src="http://t.rmncdn.com/ops/sharing-switch.png"><p>At any time during your use of the App, you can click the sharing button, pictured above, to “OFF” or “ON”. The default setting of the App's sharing button is “ON”. Setting the App's sharing button to “ON” means your activities (regardless of the App's settings described above) will be posted to your unique profile page which is shared with all of your friends who have also authorized the App. </p><p>Turning the App's sharing button to “OFF” will prevent your actions taken from within the App (while the sharing button is set to “OFF”) from being posted to your unique profile page. In addition, your actions taken from within the App while the sharing button is set to “OFF” will not be displayed outside of the App, regardless of the App's settings described above. In this manner, the App's sharing button functions as an override to the App's settings to ensure you may control sharing of your activity from right within the App. If you have any questions concerning these privacy controls, please do not hesitate to <a href="http://www.retailmenot.com/contact/">Contact Us</a>.</p><h4>RetailMeNot SMS Programs</h4><p>To utilize certain features of the Sites, you may be required to enter your mobile phone number. We will only use your mobile phone number to send you specific coupons that you have requested to be sent to your mobile device and to send you alerts, from time to time, related to special coupon offers. You can opt out of RetailMeNot SMS programs at any time by emailing <a href="mailto:appsupport@retailmenot.com">appsupport@retailmenot.com</a> or texting STOP to 42767 from your mobile device.</p><h2 id="accessing-and-correcting-personal-information">7. Accessing and Correcting Personal Information</h2><p>Keeping Personal Information about you current helps ensure that we offer you the best coupons available through our merchants and business partners. You can do several things to help keep Personal Information about you current. You can access, update and delete your Contact Information and the other information you provided us to use in your profile by logging into the Community and clicking on the "Profile" link.</p><p>If you want to close your account or have other questions or requests, please <a href="http://www.retailmenot.com/contact/">Contact Us</a>.</p><p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p><h2 id="security-of-personal-information">8. Security of Personal Information</h2><p>RetailMeNot has implemented an information security program that contains administrative, technical and physical controls that are designed to reasonably safeguard Personal Information.</p><h2 id="notice-to-residents-of-countries-outside">9. Notice to Residents of Countries outside the United States of America</h2><p>RetailMeNot is headquartered in the United States of America. Personal Information may be accessed by us or transferred to us in the United States or to our affiliates, business partners, merchants, or service providers elsewhere in the world. By providing us with Personal Information, you consent to such access and transfers. You also acknowledge and agree that Personal Information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, law enforcement officials, and national security authorities in the United States in accordance with United States laws. We will protect the privacy and security of Personal Information according to our Privacy Statement, regardless of where it is processed or stored.</p><h3>Safe Harbor</h3><p>RetailMeNot complies with the US-EU Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries. RetailMeNot has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.

European Union citizens with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@rmn.com">legal@rmn.com</a>.</p><p>RetailMeNot has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the US-EU Safe Harbor Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus.

Privacy Practices of Third Parties</h2><p>This Privacy Statement only addresses the use and disclosure of information by RetailMeNot through your interaction with the Sites.
