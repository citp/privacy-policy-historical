**Personally Identifiable Information**

Personally Identifiable Data (“PID”) is data about you that is personally identifiable. Examples of personally identifiable data that may be requested include name, address, email address, credit card number or any other information that is not otherwise publicly available. Retargeter.com is committed to making sure that clear choice is provided to all clients before any PID is collected.

###  

### Non-Personally Identifiable Data

Non-Personally Identifiable Data (“NPID”) data is collected by Retargeter.com and our partners, and is used for online site based retargeting. With respect to individuals who visit our clients sites, we, and/or one or more of our ad technology partners, may collect what is known as NPID. This data is anonymous, and can include information such as users IP address, web pages which have been viewed by the user, date and time, domain type, and responses by a user to an advertisement delivered by us or our ad technology partners. Retargeter.com and our ad technology partners use different methods to collect this type of data, including cookies and web beacons (1×1 pixels).

Persons may elect not to provide this NPID by following the NPID opt-out procedures below.

**Retargeter.com’s Use of Cookies and Web Beacons**

Retargeter.com utilizes cookies and web beacons in the delivery of display advertisements to our clients’ users on various sites across the internet. The following is an illustration of how that process works:

A person visits our client’s website. Our cookies and/ or web beacons are running on our client’s site and identify the person as a visitor to our client’s site. Retargeter.com and/or its ad technology partners begin locating this exact person across the web within seconds of their visiting our client’s site. When this person is found by their cookie and/or web beacon Retargeter.com and/or our ad technology partners serve ads to that person.

Reatargeter.com will know the following: the set of people cookied and/or beaconed for each client; whether said persons viewed the ad and if the person clicked on the advertisement upon viewing. This type of information is used in reporting; and can in no way be used to identify a specific person or user of our service. This data will never be shared with third parties or used to display ads for other clients without explicit written permission from both clients. 

The NPID data collected by Retargeter.com in the above highlighted process will be kept by Retargeter.com indefinitely and will be securely maintained and archived. This information is used for reporting purposes and is not tied to personal information. 

###  

### Sharing With Third Parties

All personally identifiable data provided by individuals is maintained in confidence by Retargeter.com. There are instances, however, in which personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information is shared with third parties, as described below.

With respect to personally identifiable information, Retargeter.com may, from time to time, provide information to certain third-party administrative vendors for efficiency purposes in providing administrative services such as billing, delivery and pay-outs, or for other services related to providing the Retargeter.com service. Any such vendor used will be required to enter into a confidentiality agreement with Retargeter.com.

Finally, Retargeter.com may share information on individuals as it deems necessary to comply with a court order or to cooperate with government and law enforcement officials.
