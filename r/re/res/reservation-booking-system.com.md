We collect information of the properties registered with BookingSuite (“ **Clients** ”); if you are a customer of one of our Clients and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our Clients that use our service, please contact the Client that you interact with directly.

BookingSuite may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the provisions in this privacy statement regarding notice and choice and the service agreements with our Clients.

We have teamed up with Booking.com B.V., located at Herengracht 597, 1017 CE Amsterdam, The Netherlands (www.booking.com) (hereafter Booking.com) to offer the customers of our Clients online reservation services. The reservations made by the customers of our Clients are processed through Booking.com.

This may include personal information such as the customer’s name, contact details, payment details, the names of guests traveling with the customer and any customer preferences specified when making a booking. To find out more about the Booking.com corporate family, visit [About Booking.com](http://www.booking.com/content/about.html). Booking.com may process the customer’s personal information for the purposes set out in the [Booking.com privacy policy](http://www.booking.com/content/privacy.en-gb.html).

If you have questions about the processing of personal information by Booking.com, please contact privacy@booking.com. A customer of a Client who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to our Client (data controller) and/or Booking.com (the data controller) via an email to customer.service@booking.com.

BookingSuite will retain personal data we process on behalf of our Clients for as long as needed to provide services to our Client. BookingSuite will retain this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
