# ResellersPanel Terms Of Service

This policy comes in confirmation of our privacy and confidentiality service level guarantee and outlines all conditions we agree to comply with concerning the safe provision of yours and your customers’ online personal registration data and the privacy of yours and your customers’ [web hosting](https://web.archive.org/shared-web-hosting/) accounts.

[](https://web.archive.org/terms/ "Privacy Policy")

**PRIVACY OF CUSTOMER PAYMENT DETAILS**  
We use encrypted SSL connection to process Customers' (resellers and end-customers) credit card information and DO NOT store any customer payment details in our system. The payments are carried out in the background by the PayPal payment processing gateway and go through the HSBC bank's terminal. Working with the two leaders in online payment operations, we guarantee fast and secure processing of Customers' payments. Not only do we NOT make a record of Customers' credit card details in our system, but also - for maximum online security - we do NOT share this information with any third party. 

**PRIVACY OF CUSTOMER ACCOUNT**  
We consider Customers' registration data and the content of all customer messages private and confidential. The header of the messages that Customers send will contain their name (e-mail address) and Internet Protocol (IP) address. We will not intentionally monitor or disclose any customer e-mail content or registration data unless we are required to do so: 

  * to enforce these Terms and Conditions,
  * by law,
  * to defend ourselves in any legal action,
  * to protect our property. 



Since Customers' passwords are essential for protecting their privacy, we encourage all Customers to NOT share their passwords with anyone and change them frequently. Additionally, Customers agree to respect the privacy and confidentiality of others. 

**PRIVACY OF CUSTOMERS' REGISTRATION DATA**  
LiquidNet Ltd. (on behalf of your Reseller Store brand name) collects certain information from Customers during the account registration process. The personally identifiable information that LiquidNet Ltd. collects includes first and last name. LiquidNet Ltd. also collects non-personally identifiable information, such as country, age, gender, etc. Customers may update their Registration Information at any time from their Web Hosting Control Panel - > My Account - > Change Login Credentials section. 

LiquidNet Ltd. will keep the personally identifiable information of all Customers private and confidential, and will NOT share it with any unauthorized third parties. We may disclose aggregate registration statistics in connection with our marketing activities. 

**WHY WE NEED THIS INFORMATION**  
Customers' registration information is needed in order for us to operate the site, to provide support for the customer account, for statistical purposes, etc. LiquidNet Ltd. will NOT send Customers' any unsolicited information, including e-mails, except as mentioned hereby.

LiquidNet Ltd. (on behalf of your Reseller Store brand name) will send a welcome e-mail to each new Customer, containing information about the features provided by the Service, as well as WHCP (Web Hosting Control Panel) and FTP login details. LiquidNet Ltd.
