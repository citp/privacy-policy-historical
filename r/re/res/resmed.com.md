# ResMed - Privacy Notice

In general, visitors to ResMed's Web sites remain anonymous (except for IP address tracking). However, some of ResMed's sites require registration, where personal information (such as name, address, and phone number) may be collected. Where personal information is collected, ResMed will make every reasonable effort to keep that information secure and will not disclose that information beyond the ResMed Group of companies other than to fulfill its business obligations to the visitor.

Where a Reseller agreement or other business relationship document exists, such a document has precedence over this Privacy Policy.

Where personal information is collected in the course of an online business transaction, the visitor consents to reasonable business usage of that information.

ResMed's Privacy Policy does not apply to sites that are beyond ResMed's control, such as linked third-party sites.

Because Internet technologies change rapidly, this Privacy Policy is subject to revision. The latest version will be posted to this site, and visitors are encouraged to review it regularly.
