This regulates the processing of personal data relating to you and grants you various rights in respect of your personal data.

The aim of this statement is to tell you how we will use any personal data you provide through the hoppa.com website or hoppa app. Please read it carefully before you proceed.

**2\. COLLECTION AND RETENTION OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

We collect a range of personal data from you such as your name, address, date of birth, debit card and credit card details (although we do not store all of your credit, debit card or account details for security reasons). We may also collect information about your usage of the website or app and information from any messages you post to the website or app and e- mails and letters that you send us.

**3\. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION AND WITH WHOM WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION**

We use your personal information in order to provide transportation services and any other services and “extras” available to purchase on our website or app from time to time; to personalize your visits to our website or app; to manage your booking; and to bill you.

We may share your personal data with third parties including the third party principal suppliers of the transport services and/or extras for the purpose of processing and managing your booking.

We may employ the services of a third party to help us in certain areas, such as website hosting. In some cases the third party may receive your information. However, at all times, we will control and be responsible for the use of your information.

We may use aggregated information for the purposes of tracking usage of the web site or app and in order to help us improve our website or app and for research and analysis purposes. We may pass this information to third parties. The aggregate information and statistics will not, however, include details that can be used to identify you.

As part of the booking process, we may make credit searches about you at credit reference agencies. The agencies will record details of any search whether or not your application succeeds. This information may be used by other subscribers for credit decisions. We may use credit scoring methods to assess your offer to make a booking and to verify your identity. Credit searches and other information which is provided to us and/or the credit reference agencies about you and anyone with whom you are linked financially may be used by us if credit decisions are made about you and anyone with whom you are linked financially or other members of your household. This information may be used for debt tracing and the prevention of money laundering as well as the management of our service to you. In addition, we may ask you to provide physical forms of identification and/or we may telephone to confirm your identity.

We may use your information if we are under a legal duty to disclose this; or in order to enforce our website terms of use and any other agreement; and/or to protect the rights of Resorthoppa (UK) Limited.

If you have consented, we may also share your details with other carefully selected organisations (including those in the travel industry) to enable such organisations to let you know about goods and services which may be of interest to you (by telephone, text and/or email).
