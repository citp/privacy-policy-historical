                We, at ReserveAmerica Holdings Inc. ("ReserveAmerica" or "we"), have created   this privacy policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to protecting your   personal information and informing you about how we handle it. This privacy   policy only applies to transactions made, and data gathered, on the   ReserveAmerica.com web site (the "Site") and does not apply to any other web   site or offline point of contact between ReserveAmerica and consumers. Please   review this privacy policy periodically to check for revisions as we may update   it from time to time. This privacy policy was last revised on October 18, 2002.   Each time you visit the Site or provide us with information, by doing so you are   accepting the practices described in this privacy policy at that   time.</p>

                Like most e-commerce websites, each time you visit the Site, we may   automatically collect your IP address and the web page from which you came. In   order to administer and optimize the Site for you and to diagnose problems with   our Site, we may use your IP address to help identify you, to gather broad   demographic information about you and for other purposes. </p>
              <p><span class="ti01"><img src="/marketing/html/marketingHTML/nav/arr01.gif" width="8" height="9"> Cookies</span><br>
                Like most websites, the Site uses cookies to keep track of your purchases,   reservations, information you submit and other activity on the Site and to   enhance your experience on the Site. We may also use cookies to deliver content   specific to your interests, to save your password, and to save other personal   and financial information so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit   the Site. Advertisers and other third parties may also place cookies on your   browser. If you wish not to allow or accept these cookies, the "help" portion of   the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how. However, if you set your browser   not to allow or accept cookies, you may not be able to access certain features   or areas on the Site.              </p>

                In order to operate the Site and provide you with information on products and   services that may be of interest to you, we may collect "personal information"   (i.e. information that could be used to contact you such as full name, postal   address, phone number and email address), "financial information" (i.e.   passwords and credit card numbers), "demographic information" (e.g., zip code,   hometown, gender, reservation and purchase history information (other than   public agency reservation information) and age) and "public agency reservation   information" (i.e., information about your planned visit to a specific   government agency-operated or government agency-administered campground or park,   such as dates of stay or number of occupants, other than personal information).   Please note that nowhere on the Site do we knowingly collect personal   information from children under the age of 13.<br>
                <br>
                <span class="ti01"><img src="/marketing/html/marketingHTML/nav/arr01.gif" width="8" height="9"> </span><span class="ti01">Information Other Web Sites Collect From You</span><br>
                On the Site, we place links to other web sites operated by other parties such   as state and federal websites. Some of these other web sites may contain our   brand names and trademarks and other intellectual property that we own; others   do not. When you click on these links and visit these other web sites,   regardless of whether or not they contain our brand names, trademarks and other   intellectual property, you need to be aware that we do not control these other   web sites or these other web sites' business practices, and that this privacy   policy does not apply to these other web sites. Consequently, the operators of   these other web sites may collect different kinds of information about you, and   may use and disclose that information in different ways than we would if it were   collected on the Site. We encourage you to review their privacy policies and   remind you that we will not be responsible for their actions.</p>
              <p><span class="ti01"><img src="/marketing/html/marketingHTML/nav/arr01.gif" width="8" height="9"> How We Use Personal Information and Public Agency   Reservation Information</span><br>
                We use your personal information and public agency reservation information to   help us efficiently perform transactions on the Site, to deliver the services   you have requested and to contact you when necessary in connection with   transactions entered into by you on the Site (including reservation   confirmations, changes and cancellations). We also use your personal information   so that we can send you information, offers, promotional materials and   newsletters. We carefully select the information we send to you and attempt to   send you offers and promotions that are of value to you, such as discounts or   exclusive offers offered by third parties. The Site provides you with the option   of declining (i.e., "opting-out" of) receiving these offers, promotional   materials and newsletters. We will not make direct use of public agency   reservation information, your telephone number or your financial information   (other than telephone numbers or financial information used or collected in   connection with products or services offered by non-government entities) in   order to send you such offers, promotional materials or newsletters. </p>
                <p>To process transactions on the Site, we may share your personal information   and public agency reservation information with our agents, representatives,   contractors and service providers so they can provide us with support services   such as authorization of credit card transactions, order fulfillment,   reservation fulfillment and sweepstakes and promotional fulfillment. We require   these entities not to use your personal information or public agency reservation   information for any other purpose.</p>
                <p>By making reservations on the Site for campgrounds or other services provided   by government entities, you consent to us sharing your personal information and   public agency reservation information with the government agencies and other   third parties associated with the reservation you are making ("Reservation   Partners"). Due to our contractual obligations with certain Reservation   Partners, we cannot offer you the opportunity to opt-out of our sharing of your   personal information and public agency reservation information with them.   Reservation Partners may use your personal information and public agency   reservation information in accordance with their own privacy policies. You will   need to contact those Reservation Partners who contact you to instruct them   directly regarding your preferences for the use of your personal information and   public agency reservation information by them. </p>
                <p>By purchasing, or making reservations for, products or services offered by   non-government entities (such as magazine subscriptions, hotel bookings or   cruises), electing to receive communications (such as emails) or electing to   participate in contests, sweepstakes, or other programs (such as discount or   rewards programs), offered or sponsored by third parties on the Site, you   consent to our providing your personal information to those third parties. Those   third parties may use your personal information in accordance with their own   privacy policies. You will need to contact those third parties to instruct them   directly regarding your preferences for the use of your personal information by   them. Additionally, you agree that we will have the right to use and disclose   all such information submitted by you to such third parties in the same manner   in which we have the right to use and disclose all other information submitted   by you directly to us. </p>
                <p>Your personal information or reservation information may be passed on to a   third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets, or a bankruptcy,   of ReserveAmerica or its corporate parent. We may also disclose specific   information when we determine that such disclosure is necessary to comply with   law, to cooperate with law enforcement or to protect the interests or safety of   ReserveAmerica or other visitors to the Site or users of services or products   provided by ReserveAmerica. We may also disclose your personal information to   our subsidiary and parent companies and businesses, and other affiliated legal   entities and businesses with whom we are under common corporate control.   However, all of these parent, subsidiary and affiliated legal entities and   businesses that receive your personal information from us will comply with the   terms of this privacy policy with respect to their use and disclosure of such   personal information.</p>
                <p>Except as may otherwise be described in this privacy policy, we have no   control over the personal information practices of Reservation Partners and   other third parties. As described above, by making reservations on the Site,   purchasing other products or services from third parties, electing to receive   communications from or to participate in contests, sweepstakes or other programs   associated with, or sponsored by, third parties, or otherwise opting to allow us   to share your information with third parties as permitted in this policy, you   authorize us to share your personal information and reservation information with   Reservation Partners and these other third parties, and you agree that we are   not responsible or liable for any of their actions or omissions. These   Reservation Partners and these other third parties may use your personal   information and reservation information in accordance with our contractual   arrangements with them and in accordance with their own privacy policies, over   which we have no control. You will need to contact them directly in order to   instruct them regarding your preferences for how they use your personal   information and reservation information. <br>

                    <span class="ti01"><img src="/marketing/html/marketingHTML/nav/arr01.gif" width="8" height="9"> How We   Use Financial Information</span><br>
                  We use your financial information to check your qualifications, to bill you   for products and services and to enable you to participate in discount, rebate   and similar programs in which you may elect to participate. By making a   reservation or purchase, or engaging in any other kind of activity that uses   financial information, on the Site, you consent to our providing your financial   information to our service providers and to such third parties as we determine   is necessary to process your transactions, as well as to your credit card issuer   for their purposes. These third parties may include the credit card companies   and banking institutions used to process the transaction. Also, depending on the   circumstances of our arrangements, we may share your financial information with   applicable Reservation Partners, primarily for facilitating your reservation at   the appropriate campsite or other location on the date of your reservation and   to provide customer service. By purchasing, or making reservations for, other   products or services of third parties (such as magazine subscriptions, hotel   bookings or cruises) offered on the Site, or by participating in programs   offered on the Site that are administered by third parties and that require you   to submit financial information in order to use them, you also consent to our   providing your financial information to those third parties as well. Any of   these various third parties, including but not limited to Reservation Partners,   are authorized to use your financial information in accordance with our   contractual arrangements with such third parties and in accordance with their   own privacy policies, over which we have no control.</p>
                <p><span class="ti01"><img src="/marketing/html/marketingHTML/nav/arr01.gif" width="8" height="9"> How We Use Demographic Information</span><br>
                  We use demographic information to tailor the Site and communications to the   interests of our users. We may share anonymous, aggregated (grouped) demographic   information with advertisers and other third parties so that they can tailor   their advertisements and communications to the appropriate audience. If we are   allowed to share with certain third parties your personal information, financial   information or public agency reservation information under this privacy policy,   as described above, then the demographic information that we provide to such   third parties may be linked to such personal information, financial information   or public agency reservation information, so that such third parties will be   able to know about your demographic information on a non-anonymous basis. </p>
                <p><span class="ti01"><img src="/marketing/html/marketingHTML/nav/arr01.gif" width="8" height="9"> Our Security Precautions; Location of Data</span><br>
                  The Site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse   and alteration of the information under our control. Our secure server software   (SSL encryption) is the industry standard and among the best software available   today for secure commerce transactions. We encrypt all of your personal and   financial information as it travels over the Internet and we store your   financial information on our servers in encrypted form. Your information may be   transferred to and maintained on computer networks which may be located outside   of the state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction in which you   reside, and the country or jurisdiction in which these computer networks are   located may not have privacy laws as protective as the laws in your country or   jurisdiction. </p>
                <p><span class="ti01"><img src="/marketing/html/marketingHTML/nav/arr01.gif" width="8" height="9"> How You Can Access and Update Your Account, Email   Preferences and Personal Information</span><br>
                  During the creation of your account on the Site, we will give you the   opportunity to opt-out of the receipt of certain communications from us. We also   give you the opportunity to opt-out and modify information you have provided to   us at any time in the My Reservations section of the Site by signing-in,   clicking on the appropriate "Update" links and changing the provided   information. </p>
                <p>In some cases you may, without creating an account or having your account   referenced, be able to purchase or reserve products or services, elect to   receive communications or elect to participate in contests, sweepstakes, or   other programs (such as discount or rewards programs), offered or sponsored by   third parties on the Site (other than campground or park reservations). After we   collect personal information that you submit in these cases, we may use it to   send you marketing emails. However, if we do so, we will provide a link that you   can click on to opt-out of receiving subsequent marketing emails generated from   the same such information. In many cases we will also provide one or more opt-in   boxes, at the point where you provide such information, so that you can indicate   your preferences before receiving marketing emails.</p>
                <p>Please note that changing or deleting your information in the My Reservations   section, or otherwise opting-out of receipt of email communications from   ReserveAmerica will only change or delete the data in our database for purposes   of transacting future business on the Site and for managing future   communications from ReserveAmerica. These changes and deletions will not change   or delete:</p>
                <p>A) Information already collected as part of a particular reservation in our   transactions database which may be shared with our Reservation Partners   regardless of your email preferences and may be used to contact you regarding   your reservation; or </p>
                <p>B) Information that we may have already forwarded to Reservation Partners,   credit card companies or any other third parties, all as provided above in this   privacy policy. You will need to contact these third parties who may contact you   directly to change your email preferences or your personal information that they   may be using to contact you. </p>
                <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, the   practices of the Site, or your dealings with the Site, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@reserveamerica.com">legal@ReserveAmerica.com.</a></p>
