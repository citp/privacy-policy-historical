        <h1>Resume-Library Privacy Policy</h1>
    </div>
    <p>Resume-Library endeavours to ensure that the information that you submit to us remains private, and that it is used only for the purposes described below. We aim to provide a safe and secure experience for all of our users. We make every effort to comply with our obligations under the 1998 Data Protection Act. Additionally, we understand the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of your Resume and other information stored about you while using the site.</p>

    <h3 class="rlH3 mt20">Account and Resume information</h3>
    <p>When you register to Resume-Library your details, including your Resume, can be made available for searching, viewing over the Internet and downloading by any direct recruiter, employment consultant or other person or organisation who requests Resumes matching your profile to be sent to them. Resume-Library attempts to verify the identity and the nature of the business of such organisations however does not make any warranties as to their authenticity.</p>

    <h3 class="rlH3 mt20">Your personal information</h3>
    <p>When you create or register your Resume with us, we will collect personal information from you, such as your name, contact details, and other details. Once you register with Resume-Library and accept our Terms &amp; Conditions, you are not anonymous to us. We may use information that you provide to alert you to our own products and services. We may contact you regarding site changes or changes to the Resume-Library products or services that you use.</p>

    <h3 class="rlH3 mt20">Disclosure of personal information</h3>
    <p class="mb15">When you register, we store some information about you in your account, but it is protected by your password and may only be accessed by you. It does not form part of our candidate database and cannot be searched or accessed by Resume-Library customers. You can delete your account at any time.</p>
    <p class="mb15">If you choose to create a profile and upload a Resume to our database, we rely on you to ensure that your details are kept up to date. You should update your CV at least every six months, particularly if your contact details have changed.</p>
    <p class="mb15">Please note that Resume-Library reserves the right to remove from our database, Resumes which include any content that we consider to be illegal or offensive.</p>
    <p class="mb15">We do not disclose information about your individual visits to the Resume-Library site, or personal information that you provide, such as your name and personal contact details unless you have given us your permission or we believe that the law requires it. N.B. that by registering with Resume-Library you are granting us permission to disclose this information. We may record and share aggregated information with our clients. Additionally, if you input your information on a co-branded registration page or job application page, eg a Resume-Library client-company registration page then the information that you give becomes the property of both Resume-Library and the client. Resume-Library is not responsible for the information that the client receives.</p>
    <p class="mb15">Resume-Library will also use the aggregate data to identify employment trends across different industries, such as salary averages. This information will not be capable of being linked to any personally identifying information about users.</p>
    <p class="mb15"><strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> Your current employer may be a customer of Resume-Library, or a client of one of our customers. Resume-Library cannot restrict the customers who access profiles on our database and cannot be held responsible for any eventuality.</p>

    <h3 class="rlH3 mt20">Information collection and use</h3>
    <p class="mb15">Like many websites, we routinely capture your IP address information to determine your location. This helps us work out whether you are visiting the site from within the UK, EU or rest of the world, and means we can show you content that's specific to your location and ask the right questions about your eligibility to work in the specific country you are wishing to work in, should you wish to apply for a job on Resume-Library. Resume-Library automatically receives and records information on our web server logs from your browser including your IP address. Resume-Library records IP addresses for anonymous statistical purposes, administration of our website and servers, and to improve our services.</p>
    <p class="mb15">An IP address, or 'internet protocol address', is a unique identifying number given to every device connected to the internet. Like a car license plate, an IP address is a special serial number used for identification.</p>
    <p class="mb15">Information may be gathered from your registration form and your use of our website through "cookies". The information gathered may be used by Resume-Library internally, for purposes relating to your use of the website and for marketing activities, and may be passed to carefully selected third parties to use for marketing activities. If you subsequently decide you no longer wish to receive direct marketing/information from Resume-Library or no longer wish us to pass your information to third parties you should notify us using the Contact page of our website or delete your Resume.</p>
    <p>Resume-Library may set and access cookies on your computer. You can choose whether or not to accept cookies, however, if you do not accept Resume-Library cookies, some of our services may not be available to you. This policy does not apply to companies that Resume-Library does not own or control, or to people that Resume-Library does not employ.</p>

    <h3 class="rlH3 mt20">Statistical information</h3>
    <p>Resume-Library gathers general information about users, for example, what services users access the most and which areas of the Resume-Library site are most frequently visited, the number of Resumes on the database, or the number of visitors to the site and for other lawful purposes. Such data is used in the aggregate to help us to understand how the Resume-Library site is used. We gather this information so that we can continue to improve and develop our services to benefit our users. We may make this aggregated information available to users of the Resume-Library site, to our clients, advertisers, suppliers and other reputable third parties. These statistics are anonymous and contain no personal information and cannot be used to gather such information.</p>

    <h3 class="rlH3 mt20">Security</h3>
    <p class="mb15">The site is protected against unauthorised access using the latest security devices and 'firewalls'.</p>
    <p class="mb15">Similar to the spam you receive in your personal email inbox, fraudsters have started creating false job offers in an attempt to gather personal details. We consistently monitor job postings on the site and we are committed to ensuring that jobs listed on Resume-Library.com are legitimate and comply with our terms &amp; conditions.</p>
    <p class="mb15">At no point during the application process with Resume-Library should you be asked to complete any monetary transactions or provide personal information beyond your resume.</p>
    <p class="mb15">If you notice anything suspicious, we advise you to email us on <a href="mailto:help@resume-library.com">help@resume-library.com</a> and stop communication with the recruiter or employer. For more information on how to spot scam emails, take a look at this blog <a href="http://www.resume-library.com/discover/?p=410" target="_blank">post</a>.</p>

    <h3 class="rlH3 mt20">Other ways of ensuring your privacy:</h3>
    <p class="mb15">You may amend your personal details at any time. These options are available when you login to our website.</p>
    <p class="mb15">You may unsubscribe from any employment or promotional information that we may send to you by in any of the following ways:</p>
