# Privacy Policy - Restoration Games

We are committed to protecting your privacy. We do not generally ask for your personal information as  
part of the ordinary use of the site. We only request personal information for two uses:

**1) Our Newsletter:** To sign up for our newsletter, you must provide us with an email address and may  
provide your name, but are not required to. We do not store this personal information. That information  
is transmitted to our third-party mail service, MailChimp, who maintains the information for use as part  
of the newsletter service. You may view MailChimp’s privacy policy directly on their site. We do not  
share your personal information with anyone other than that.

**2) Our Store:** We do not require you to log in to purchase items from our webstore. However, to process  
payments for purchases, you must provide us with information such as you billing address and payment  
information. We do not store this personal information. That information is transmitted to our third-  
party payment processing services, including Authorize.net. We do not share your personal information  
with anyone other than that.
