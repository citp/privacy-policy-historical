				<p><b>Response Magic Contact and Opt Out Policy</b></p>
				<p>The contact information contained within the Response Magic 
				accounts of our customers is private and confidential.&nbsp; We 
				do not share or sell contact information to Response Magic 
				users.&nbsp; </p>
				<p>Each contact within a Response Magic account may Opt Out of 
				receiving the emails being sent to them by the Response Magic 
				account owner at any time.&nbsp; Each email sent by Response 
				Magic to a recipient contains a link at the bottom which allows 
				for the recipient to Opt Out of receiving emails.&nbsp; In 
				addition, the recipient can choose to opt out of all future 
				emails by either that sender's Response Magic account or 
				globally.&nbsp; If the contact chooses to opt out globally, the 
				email address they provide will be blocked by our system 
				completely, meaning that no Response Magic user can add that 
				email address to their system at any time in the future. </p>
				<p>To globally opt out, please fill out the form found
				<a href="http://www.responsemagic.com/optout.php">here</a></p>
				<p>Opt Outs are handled on an email address basis.&nbsp; If a 
				recipient opts out, they will only be opting out to receive 
				emails to that specific email address.&nbsp; </p>
				<p>Opt Out requests can only be reversed pending contact from 
				the opted-out recipient from the email address that was removed.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

                  <p>Platinum Synergy recognizes the importance of respecting 
                    the privacy of those who decided to entrust their sensitive 
                    information with you. We assure to make every effort to safeguard 
                    their security. Platinum Synergy will never use the information 
                    about the customers you collect within our services to send

                  <p><strong>Cookies </strong></p>
                  <p>Similar to other commercial websites, the technology called 
                    "cookies" may be used to provide you with tailored 
                    information. A cookie is a small piece of data that a website 
                    can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your 
                    hard drive so we can recognize you when you return. You may 
                    be able to set your browser to notify you when you receive 
                    a cookie. Our cookies collect general information that enhances 
                    our ability to serve you and measure the utility of our website.

                    <strong>Information Security </strong></p>
                  <p>We believe that keeping personal information secure is one 
                    of our most significant responsibilities. We restrict access 
                    to Personal Information about you to those employees and others 
                    who need to know that information to assist us in our business, 
                    or to provide products or services to you. We safeguard personal 
                    information, according to established security standards and 
                    procedures, by maintaining physical, electronic, and procedural 
                    safeguards for the information. </p>
                  <p>When we request customers to enter sensitive information 
                    (such as the credit card number), it is encrypted and protected 
                    with the best encryption software in the industry -- SSL. 
                    While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon 
                    at the bottom of web browsers, such as Netscape Navigator 
                    and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed 
                    to unlocked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. </p>
                  <p>All of our customers' information, not just the sensitive 
                    information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. 
                    Only employees who need the information to perform a specific 
                    job (for example, our billing clerk, or a customer service 
                    representative) are granted access to personally identifiable 
                    information.</p>
