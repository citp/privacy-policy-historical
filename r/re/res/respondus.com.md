## **Personally Identifiable Information**

## Definition of Personally Identifiable Information

"Personally identifiable information" is your name, company, address, e-mail address, phone number(s) and credit card information. 

## Where We Collect Personally Identifiable Information

Respondus.com collects personally identifiable information when you (1) register a product, (2) make a purchase, (3) sign up for a beta program, newsletter, or similar program, (4) submit feedback, or other inquiries. 

## How We Use Personally Identifiable Information

Respondus uses your personally identifiable information to bill your credit card for purchases, to confirm your orders, to prevent fraud against you, and to contact you. For example, when you place an order on Respondus.com, we need to know your name, institution, e-mail address, address, and credit card information. This allows us to fulfill your order and notify you of your order status. 

Respondus.com also compiles aggregate data from all of our visitors to prepare internal reports about which pages are popular, how many total unique users visit our site, and different traffic patterns. Respondus does not combine your personally identifiable information with information about pages visited. 

## Who We Disclose Personally Identifiable Information To

Respondus, Inc. will not sell, rent, trade or disclose your personally identifiable information to anyone except as explained in this policy. 

We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, marketing our products, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. These companies have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes or share it with an additional party, 

Respondus may also disclose your personal information to law enforcement personnel, government officials, or others when we, in our sole discretion, believe that disclosure is necessary to prevent violations of the law, injury to person or property, or any harm to Respondus.com or others. 

As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy companies or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the event that Respondus, Inc., or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will likely be one of the transferred assets. 

## Third-Party Service Providers

Individual student purchases of Respondus Monitor will redirect the user to PayPal, a secure web site that automatically encrypts confidential information transmitted from the computer to PayPal using the Secure Sockets Layer protocol (SSL) with 128 bit encryption. Credit card or debit information is used only for that particular transaction and is not stored by Respondus. A name and email address is gathered during the purchase but this information will only be used for matters relating to the transaction itself.
