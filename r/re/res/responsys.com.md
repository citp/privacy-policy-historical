## Information Hosting, Processing and Collection Practices

### Information Regarding Data Hosted for our Clients and Processed on Their Behalf

We may host and process the following kinds of personal information on behalf of our clients:

  * Name, email address, phone number, address, gender, date of birth, preferences, and transaction history.



We use this information to:

  * Administer and provide our services on behalf of our clients.



Responsys hosts information provided to it by its clients and processes that information under the direction of its clients. Responsys has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. Responsys will work with its clients to help them provide notice to their customers concerning the purpose for which personal information is collected.

#### Access to Data Controlled by our Clients

Because Responsys has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes, an individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to Responsys’ client (the data controller). If the client requests Responsys to remove the data, we will respond to their request within 30 days. 

#### Data Retention

Responsys will retain personal data we process on behalf of our clients for as long as needed to provide services to our client. Responsys also will retain and use this personal data as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

### Information Regarding Data Collected From Our Web Site and Service

You can visit the Web site to read information about our company, products, and services without telling us who you are and without revealing any personal information. In operating the Web site, Responsys includes optional information request forms such as white paper or webinar request forms, newsletter subscription forms, and general contact request forms that request your name, company, title, phone number, email address, URL, address and other information to help us determine your needs related to our products and solutions and in order for you to download or view documents or other information through the Web site. We use this information to send updates about our company and to contact you if requested or necessary. Depending upon your request, Responsys may also ask for additional information, such as how you heard about us. This information is provided by you on a voluntary basis only and is not required by us in order for you to use and enjoy the Web site. Responsys uses the information that we collect on the Web site to contact you to further discuss your interest in our company and services, and to send information regarding our company or partners, such as marketing promotions and events. We also use this information to improve the way that we provide our services to our clients, to relay administrative information, and to verify login information. The information is collected and stored in a manner that is appropriate for the nature of the data that we collect, and the need to fulfill your request. Finally, we may forward to our vendors and business partners information that you provide to us, but only so they can provide us services, such as responding to your request to receive information or providing web analytics services to Responsys.

### Responsys Clients

If you are a client of Responsys (or work on behalf of a Responsys client), through our secure web interface, we also collect your user ID, username and password, and any other information that you provide to us on behalf of the client that you are representing, pursuant to the terms of a license or other agreement between the applicable client and Responsys (the “Client Agreement”). You should refer to that Client Agreement in addition to this Privacy Policy with regard to your use of the Responsys Web site and Service and Responsys’ privacy obligations.

### Automatic Collection

Our servers automatically recognize visitors’ IP addresses (the number assigned to computers on the Internet), domain names, the activity of the visitor’s browser when the visitor is viewing the Web site; the site path of visitors; the time visitors come to the Web site; and length of visit. No personal information about you is revealed in the process. The Web site may also gather anonymous traffic data that does not personally identify you but that may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer, and Responsys reserves the right to use and display such anonymous, aggregate summary information regarding its visitors for promotional purposes.

Responsys uses "cookies" and "web beacons" to collect data. A cookie is a small text file containing a random and unique identifier that either Responsys, or its third party web analytics providers on behalf of Responsys, transfers to your computer's hard drive through your web browser (unless you set your browser to reject cookies) that enables Responsys’ or its third party web analytics providers’ systems to recognize your browser. Responsys uses cookies to track your movement through the Web site and verify the login status of clients using products or services linked directly within the Responsys Web site. Cookies are also used to track point of entry to point of registration for those users participating in our affiliate signup programs or to track and measure the success of a particular marketing campaign. Neither Responsys nor its third party web analytics providers store any personally identifiable information in cookies. Web beacons (also known as clear gifs) are typically transparent graphic images (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that are placed on a site or in an email and used by Responsys and its third party web analytics providers in combination with cookies to help us understand how you interact with the Responsys Web site and Service. We use web beacons to measure visitor and recipient behavior, help us improve visitor experience, and help us manage site content.

### Security and Privacy

Responsys' Web site and Service use security measures to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. We store the information in a database in a secure environment at our data centers. When you enter sensitive information (such as login credentials) we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

Responsys takes care to reinforce to our employees the importance of security and privacy of our clients’ and Web site visitors’ data. Responsys requires unique usernames and passwords that must be entered each time a user logs on to Responsys’ client interface. These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of all data. The bottom line is that because our business involves hosting application accounts, data security is paramount. We are constantly reevaluating and deploying new technologies to enhance our security.

In order to accommodate changes in our business, we may sell or buy companies or assets. In such transactions, visitor information may be one of the transferred assets. In the event assets of Responsys are sold in a transaction, our visitor information may be an asset that is reviewed and transferred. Such a transaction will be disclosed per the "Notification of Privacy Policy Changes" guidelines above. Also, as with the data we collect on behalf of our clients, we reserve the right to disclose any data we collect if required by law or valid order of a court or other governmental authority or to protect the health and safety of Responsys’ employees or the general public.

Responsys is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any other web sites to which we link. We encourage our visitors to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that they visit.

### Updating and Choice/Opt-Out

Visitors who request information on our Web site have the following options for reviewing, modifying and deleting any personally identifiable information that has previously been provided to Responsys, as well as updating their profiles and unsubscribing (opting out) to avoid receiving future communications from Responsys: 

  * Sending an email message to [privacy@responsys.com](mailto:privacy@responsys.com). We will reply within 30 days of receiving your request confirming any corrections or updates requested.
  * If you are subscribed to newsletters or other commercial emails from us, you may send us a request to unsubscribe from receiving such emails at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions within the email. We will comply with your unsubscribe request within 10 business days after receipt of such request (or any shorter time period, if required by law).



Note that if you wish to unsubscribe from emails sent by our clients (as opposed to emails sent by Responsys directly), you will need to follow the unsubscribe or opt-out instructions in such emails.
