        <dt>2. Types of Information Collected and Uses of Collected Information</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                We collect two types of information about our Site Users: Personally Identifiable
                Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Personally Identifiable Information. </strong>Personally Identifiable Information
                    is information that identifies a specific End User. When you engage in certain activities
                    on the Website, such as creating an account, signing in to your account, ordering a 
                    product or service from us or our partners, adding items to your shopping cart, submitting
                    content and/or posting User Content, entering a contest or sweepstakes sponsored by us 
                    or our partners, filling out a survey, posting a review, sending us or our partners 
                    feedback, requesting information about our services, submitting an affiliate agreement, 
                    applying for a job or to be a consultant or supplier, posting a video or signing up for 
                    special offers from third parties through the Website (collectively, "Identification Activities"), 
                    we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself. It is optional for you to 
                    engage in an Identification Activity. If you elect to engage in an Identification Activity, 
                    however, we may ask you to provide us with certain personal information about yourself, 
                    such as your first and last name, mailing address (including zip code), email address, 
                    telephone number, date of birth and Restaurant.com account information. When you order 
                    products or services, we may also ask you to provide us with your credit card number, 
                    expiration date and authentication codes or related information.  We may also know your 
                    location if you access the Site.  Depending on the activity, some of the information 
                    we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some is identified as voluntary. 
                    If you do not provide the mandatory information for a particular activity that requires 
                    it, you will not be permitted to engage in that activity
            </p>
            <p>
                   We may collect, use and store Personally Identifiable Information to provide products 
                   and services to you, make the log-in and checkout process easier, administer sweepstakes 
                   and contests, help you track your past purchases and orders, enhance the operation of the 
                   Site, improve our marketing and promotional efforts to your tastes and location, customize 
                   future shopping interests, analyze Site use, improve our product and service offerings, 
                   and to tailor your experience with third parties as provided in Item 3 of this Privacy Policy.  
            </p>
            <p>    If you provide User Content, such as an email to our customer service or response to a 
                   restaurant survey, we may use your comments and feedback to tell others about our services, and 
                   may post your comment in our marketing materials or on our Website. In connection with such User 
                   Content, we may also display partial information such as first name, initial of last name, city 
                   and state.  Such partial information is not considered Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
            <p>    In addition, if you use our Site to send information or a product to another person, we 
                   may store your personal information, and the personal information of any recipient. We may use 
                   that other person’s contact information to allow him or her to view and accept your gift or to 
                   allow the recipient to access the information you requested we send. As another example, if you 
                   put items in your shopping cart, we may save the items you have selected to make your checkout 
                   process easier in the future, or to remind you about the items you may have forgotten. We may 
                   also use Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, resolve disputes, accomplish 
                   administrative tasks, contact you, enforce our agreements with you, including our Site Terms 
                   of Use and this Privacy Policy, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement 
                   activities. </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</strong> Non-Personally Identifiable Information 
                    is information that does not identify a specific End User. This type of information may include 
                    things like the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the website you visited before coming to our 
                    Website, the URL of the website you visit after leaving our Website, the type of browser you are 
                    using and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. We, and/or our authorized Third Party Service 
                    Providers and Advertisers, may automatically collect this information when you visit our Website 
                    through the use of electronic tools like Cookies and Web beacons or Pixel tags, as described 
                    in Items 4 and 8 of this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>
                    We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, administer the Website, analyze 
                    trends, gather demographic information, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law 
                    enforcement activities. We may also share this information with our authorized Third Party 
                    Service Providers and Advertisers to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, 
                    content, and programming..</p>

        <dt>3. Release of Personally Identifiable Information</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                We will not share your Personally Identifiable Information with other parties except
                as provided below:</p>
            <p>
                <strong>We may share your information with Affiliated Restaurants.</strong> 
                We provide some products or services jointly with particular restaurants. 
                These are known as "Affiliated Restaurants." We share some of your Personally 
                Identifiable Information with Affiliated Restaurants in order to help them provide 
                you with better service and track the value of our program. Sharing this 
                Information will allow an Affiliated Restaurant to market directly to you should 
                they choose to do so. However, we will only share Personally Identifiable Information 
                with an Affiliated Restaurant if you engage in an Identification Activity, 
                and then only to the Affiliated Restaurant involved in that Identification 
                Activity. For example, if you purchase a promotional certificate
                for a particular restaurant, we may share your name, email address and city with
                that restaurant. We may also share your Personally Identifiable Information with
                an Affiliated Restaurant if you choose to make an online reservation using our Website.
                The Affiliated Restaurant needs this information to complete the reservation and
                it may contact you regarding the reservation.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>We may share your information with Affiliated Businesses.</strong> We provide
                some products or services jointly with other retail merchants who offer discounts
                through us. These are known as "Affiliated Businesses." We may share your Personally
                Identifiable Information with an Affiliated Business so they can contact you regarding
                a transaction. Sharing this Information will allow an Affiliated Business to market
                directly to you should they choose to do so. However, we will only share Personally
                Identifiable Information with an Affiliated Business if you engage in an Identification
                Activity, and then only to the Affiliated Business involved in that Identification
                Activity. For example, if you purchase a promotional certificate for a particular
                retail merchant, we may share your name, email address and city with that merchant.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>We may share your information with Marketing Partners.</strong> From time
                to time we may establish a business relationship with third parties. These are known
                as our "Marketing Partners." We may share your Personally Identifiable Information
                with our Marketing Partners to enable them to contact you regarding products, services,
                and special offers that may be of interest to you. Some Marketing Partners may contact
                you from a promotional space on our Website, and others may contact you via email.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>We may share your information with Authorized Third Party Service Providers.</strong>
                We provide some of our services and products through third parties. These "Third Party 
                Service Providers" perform functions on our behalf, like sending out and distributing 
                our administrative and promotional emails. We may share your Personally Identifiable 
                Information with such Service Providers to fulfill orders, deliver packages, send 
                postal or email, administer contests or sweepstakes, remove repetitive information 
                and improve information on customer lists and databases, analyze data and activities, 
                provide marketing assistance, provide search results and links, process credit card payments, 
                operate the Website, troubleshoot, and provide customer service. We may also collect personal 
                information from individuals and companies ("Affiliates") with whom we have business 
                relationships and may have to also share their information with Service Providers to 
                accomplish our administrative tasks. For example, when you order a service, we release 
                your credit card information to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment for the service 
                and, if applicable, release your address to the delivery service to deliver the service. 
                Likewise, we may release an Affiliate’s information to our bank to send out a payment. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We encourage Affiliated Restaurants, Affiliated Businesses, Marketing Partners and
                Third Party Service Providers to adopt and post privacy policies. However, the use
                of your Personally Identifiable Information by such parties is governed by the privacy
                policies of such parties and is not subject to our control.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>We may share your information in a Business Transfer.</strong> As with any
                other business, we could merge with, or be acquired by another company. If this
                occurs, the successor company would acquire the information we maintain, including
                Personally Identifiable Information. However, Personally Identifiable Information
                would remain subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>
                We may share your information for our Protection and the Protection of Others. We
                may also disclose Personally Identifiable Information when we believe release is
                appropriate to comply with the law or a court order; enforce or apply this Privacy
                Policy, our Website Terms of Use or other agreements; or protect the rights, property
                or safety of the Website, its Users or others.</p>

                We may disclose or share Non-Personally Identifiable Information with Partners,
                Affiliates and Advertisers. For example, we may share aggregated demographic information
                (which does not include any Personally Identifiable Information) with "Third Party
                Advertisers" or "Third Party Advertising Companies" and other parties as provided

            <p>
                We use Third Party Advertising Companies to serve ads when you visit our Website.
                These companies may use Non-Personally Identifiable Information about your visits
                to this and other websites in order to provide, through the use of network tags,
                advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. Some of
                these Third Party Advertising Companies may be advertising networks that are members
                of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"). If you would like more information
                about any NAI member company, or you would like to opt-out of targeted advertising
                from any NAI member company, click here: <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp</a></p>
            <p>
                We also use Third Party Service Providers, like Omniture, to track and analyze Non-Personally
                Identifiable usage and volume statistical information from our Users to administer
                our Website and constantly improve its quality. We may also publish this information
                for promotional purposes or as a representative audience for Advertisers. Please
                note that this is not Personally Identifiable Information, only general summaries
                of the activities of our Users. Such data is collected on our behalf, and is owned
                and used by us. If you would like more information about this policy, including
                how to opt out, please visit: <a href="http://www.omniture.com/privacy.html" target="_blank">

                We believe that you should have the ability to access and edit the Personally Identifiable
                Information you provide us. You may change any of your Personally Identifiable Information
                by: (1) updating your account at <a href="http://www2.restaurant.com/accountmanager/account/login/my-home.asp?pgn=x" target="_blank">
                    http://www.restaurant.com/accountmanager/account/login/my-home.asp</a> (2) <a href="mailto:info@restaurant.com">
                        emailing us</a>; or (3) writing to us at the address below. Please indicate
                your name, address and email address, and what information you would like to update
                when you contact us.</p>
            <p>
                We encourage you to promptly update your Personally Identifiable Information if
                it changes. You may ask to have the information on your account deleted or removed;
                however, because we keep track of past transactions, you cannot delete information
                associated with past transactions on the Website. In addition, in may be impossible
                for us to completely delete all of your information because we periodically backup
                information.</p>

        <dt>6. User Choices on Collection and Use of Information</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, although it
                may be required to engage in a certain activity on the Website.</p>
            <p>
                As a condition of account registration, we require your permission to send you Administrative
                and Promotional emails. We will send you information regarding your account activity
                and purchases as well as updates about our products and promotional offers. You
                cannot opt-out of Administrative Emails. "Administrative Emails" relate to a User’s
                activity on the Website, and include emails regarding a particular User’s account,
                requests or inquiries, and purchases of products and services. In contrast to Administrative
                Emails, however, you do have a choice with respect to Promotional Emails. Promotional
                Emails update you about new services available on our Site, and advertise our products
                and services, including exclusive sales and other offers, and/or the products and
                services of our Advertisers and Affiliates. We send Promotional Emails to Users
                who register with us and have not opted-out of receiving Promotional Emails. If
                you do not want to receive Promotional Emails from us, you may elect to opt-out
                of receiving Promotional Emails at any time after registering by (1) adjusting your
                account preferences at <a href="http://www2.restaurant.com/accountmanager/account/login/">
                 http://www.restaurant.com/my-restaurant.asp;</a> (2) <a href="mailto:info@restaurant.com">
                emailing us</a>; (3) writing to us at the address found below, or (4) hitting
                the "unsubscribe" button at the bottom of any of our promotional emails. When contacting us,
                please indicate your name, address, email address, and what Promotional Emails you
                do not want to receive. For SMS Text Messaging, reply “Stop” and we will remove you from 
                receiving SMS Text Alerts.  Please note that this paragraph applies to Promotional Emails
                only if another agreement (like an Incentive or Loyalty Solution ("ILS") Division
                agreement or Affiliate agreement) does not supersede this term of the policy. If
                you received a promotional certificate through our ILS division, please either <a href="mailto:corpsalesinfo@restaurant.com">contact us</a> or contact the company
                that gave you the certificate to determine if our Promotional Email Policy applies
                to you.</p>
            <p>
                You also have a choice with respect to the sharing of your Personally Identifiable
                Information with Affiliated Businesses and Marketing Partners for direct marketing
                purposes (but not with Affiliated Businesses for transaction-related purposes, Affiliated
                Restaurants, or Third Party Service Providers). As described above, if we share
                your Personally Identifiable Information with Affiliated Business or Marketing Partners,
                such companies may contact you regarding products and services that may be of interest
                to you. If you do not want us to share your Personally Identifiable Information
                with Affiliated Businesses or Marketing Partners for direct marketing purposes,
                you may elect to opt-out of such information sharing after you sign up as a registered
                User by (1) adjusting your account preferences at <a href="http://www2.restaurant.com/accountmanager/account/login/">
                    http://www.restaurant.com/my-restaurant.asp;</a> (2) <a href="mailto:info@restaurant.com">
                        emailing us</a>; or (3) writing to us at the address found below. When contacting
                us, please indicate your name, address, email address, and what information you
                do not want us to share with Affiliated Businesses or Marketing Partners. Please
                note that because email addresses and names are one mechanism used by Affiliated
                Restaurants to track the success of our service, we must share your name and address
                with an Affiliated Restaurant when you purchase or redeem a promotional certificate
                to that particular Affiliated Restaurant. If you receive unwanted communication
                from an Affiliated Restaurant, contact such Affiliated Restaurant directly to address
                such communications.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please note that opting out of our Promotional Emails or information sharing as
                described above will only affect future communications from us. This means, for
                example, that while we will promptly stop sharing such information once we receive
                your opt-out request, if we shared your information with an Affiliated Business
                or Marketing Partner before your request, you must contact such Marketing Partner
                or Affiliated Business to directly opt-out of its communications.</p>
            <p>
                If you are a restaurant partner and you provided us with your email address, you
                will receive service-oriented Partner Emails from us regarding your account. You
                have the choice of whether you would like to receive these emails. If you do not
                wish to receive account updates, you can opt-out by (1) <a href="mailto:partnersupport@restaurant.com">
                    emailing us</a>; (2) writing to us at the address found below; or (3) hitting
                the unsubscribe button at the bottom of an account email. If you wish you receive
                our promotional emails, you must opt-in to those emails on our consumer Website.
                Please note that opting-out (once you have opted-in) of Promotional Emails will
                not result in your opting out of Partner Emails and vice versa.

                We take security seriously and take numerous precautions to protect the security

                you do not share your password with anyone. In addition, your Personally Identifiable
                Information resides on a secure server that only selected personnel and contractors
                have access to. We encrypt certain sensitive information using Secure Socket Layer

                Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can
                be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we employ commercially reasonable
                security measures to protect data and seek to partner with companies which do the
                same, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted to or from
                the Website, and are not responsible for the actions of any third parties that may

                Companies to display advertisements on our Website. As part of their service,

                promotions, or we may allow our Third Party Service Providers to use these devices on our 
                behalf.  These tools are software code that allows us to determine what pages you visit, 
                whether you have performed a specific action, etc. When you access these pages or open or 
                click an email, these tools generate a notice of that action. These tools allow us to 
                measure and improve our understanding of visitor traffic and behavior on our Website, 
                as well as give us a way to measure our promotions and performance. We may also utilize

                Partners for the same purposes.</p>
