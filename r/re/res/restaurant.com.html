<b>Privacy Policy</b> <br>
<br>
This online privacy policy tells you about the information Restaurant.com collects 
through our website(s), www.restaurant.com (the "Website"), how we use that information 
and how you can opt out of certain uses of information we may collect. If you 
have any questions about our privacy policy or our use of your information, you 
can e-mail us at <a href="mailto:info@restaurant.com">info@restaurant.com</a>. 
</p>
<p>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY BEFORE USING ANY OF RESTAURANT.COM 
SERVICES. BY USING ANY SUCH SERVICES AND/OR NAVIGATING THROUGH THE WEBSITE YOU 
ARE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS POLICY AND THAT YOU AGREE 
TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS 
PRIVACY POLICY, SIMPLY EXIT THIS PAGE WITHOUT ACCESSING OR USING ANY OF OUR SERVICES. 
</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms of the Restaurant 
Terms of Use Agreement, which is also posted at the Website. This Privacy Policy 
was last updated on July 1, 2003. </p>
<p>Below you will find information on a number of topics, including: </p>
<ol>
<li>What personally identifiable information of yours is collected from you through 
the Website; </li>
<li>How the collected information is used; </li>
<li>With whom such information may be shared; </li>
<li>What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution 
of the information; </li>
<li>The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse 
or alteration of information under our control; and </li>
<li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information. </li>
</ol>
<p><b>A Special Note About Children.</b> Children are not eligible to use our 
service and we ask that minors (under the age of 13) do not submit any personal 
information to us or use the service. Restaurant.com does not collect or maintain 
information from those actually known to be under the age of 13, and no part of 
our Website is structured to attract anyone under the age of 13. </p>
<p><b>General Information Collection and Use </b></p>
<p>Restaurant.com is the sole owner of the information collected on the Website. 
We will not sell, share or rent this information to others in ways different from 
what is disclosed in this policy, without first obtaining your consent. Generally, 
we request this information when registering visitors to the Website, when visitors 
to the Website and/or registered users request a particular service, or when website 
visitors enter a sweepstakes or contest. This information collected is used to 
register the user for the selected service and to contact the user about such 
service (e.g. e-mail address). Information required to be submitted to become 
a registered user includes name, e-mail address and street address. Information 
required to be submitted to become an affiliate includes name, website name and 
URL, e-mail address, phone number, taxpayer identification number, name to which 
checks should be written and tax classification. In addition to the foregoing, 
for purposes of allowing targeted marketing to such individuals, applicable restaurant 
owners are provided with access to the name and e-mail information for each purchaser 
of a gift certificate for their restaurant once such certificate has been validated. 
Certain of our clients (e.g. participants in the affiliate program) have the ability 
to sign up to receive e-mails from Restaurant.com, however no such e-mails will 
be sent to a client unless such client has requested to receive it. </p>
<p>Some of our services may be offered in conjunction with partner companies, 
affiliates or other companies or websites with which we work. In order for us 
to provide these services to you, it may be necessary for us to share your personal 
information with one of such entities. These parties are not allowed to use personally 
identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services. If 
you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer 
by not using that particular service. </p>
<p><b>Customer Service Correspondence </b></p>
<p>If you send us correspondence, including e-mails and faxes, we may retain such 
information in the records of your account. We may also retain customer service 
correspondence and other correspondence from Restaurant.com to you. We retain 
these records in order to measure and improve our customer service, and to investigate 
potential fraud and violations of our Terms of Use Agreement. We may, over time, 
delete these records if permitted by law. </p>
<p><b>Cookies</b> </p>
<p>A "cookie" is a piece of data stored on a user's hard drive containing information 
about the user. As part of offering and providing personalized services, we may 
use cookies in an effort to save you time while on our Website. If a user rejects 
the cookie, he or she may still have limited use of the Website. Generally we 
use cookies to: </p>
<ol>
<li>Remind us who you are and to access your account information; </li>
<li>Track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our 
Website; and </li>
<li>Estimate our audience size and measure certain traffic patterns. </li>
</ol>
<p><b>IP Addresses </b></p>
<p>Every computer connected to the Internet is given an IP address. We use IP 
addresses to analyze trends, administer the Website, track users' movement and 
gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked 
to personally identifiable information, and our web servers do not record the 
e-mail addresses of our visitors. </p>
<p><b>Sharing</b> </p>
<p>As a general rule, except as described in this privacy policy, we will not 
disclose any of your personally identifiable information except when we have your 
permission or under special circumstances (such as when we believe the law requires 
it). We may disclose or share aggregated demographic information with certain 
partners, affiliates and advertisers, however, except as described above, this 
is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person 
or company. In addition, Restaurant.com may disclose account or other personal 
information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is 
necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be 
causing injury to or interference with Restaurant.com's rights or property, other 
Website users or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. </p>
<p>Restaurant.com may also release personal information to appropriate governmental 
authorities under the following circumstances: </p>
<ul>
<li>Where release is required by law (for example, a subpoena) or regulation, 
or is requested by a government agency conducting investigations or proceedings; 
or </li>
<li>Where our records indicate a company may be engaged in fraudulent activity 
or other deceptive practices that a governmental agency should be made aware of. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>As with any other business, it is possible that Restaurant.com in the future 
could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, 
the successor company would have access to the information maintained by Restaurant.com, 
including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this 
Privacy Policy unless and until it is amended as described herein. </p>
<p><b>Links</b> </p>
<p>This Website may contain links to other websites. Please be aware that we are 
not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites, as this privacy 
policy applies solely to the Website. We encourage our users to remain vigilant 
when they leave our Website and to read the privacy statements of each and every 
website that collects personally identifiable information. </p>
<p><b>Surveys</b> </p>
<p>From time-to-time our Website may request information from users via surveys 
(e.g. within the Feedback section of the Website). Participation in these surveys, 
to the extent we run any, is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a 
choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may 
include contact information (such as name and shipping address) and demographic 
information (such as zip code and age level). Survey information will be used 
for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of the Website. 
</p>
<p><b>Security</b> </p>
<p>This Website takes numerous precautions to protect our users' information. 
When users submit sensitive information via the Website (e.g. [credit card information]), 
such information is protected both on- and offline. <b>[We encrypt certain sensitive 
information using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to ensure that our visitors' 
information is safe as it is sent over the Internet to our server. SSL works by 
using a private key to encrypt data that is transferred over the SSL connection]</b>. 
In addition, all of our users' sensitive information is restricted in our offices. 
While Restaurant.com employs commercially reasonable security measures to protect 
our data and seeks to partner with companies which do the same, we cannot absolutely 
guarantee the security of any data transmission over the Internet or any wireless 
network. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless 
network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and we therefore are not responsible 
for any breach of security or for any actions of any third parties that may receive 
any such information. </p>
<p><b>Correction/Updating Personal Information </b></p>
<p>If your personally identifiable information changes at any time, please send 
an e-mail to <a href="mailto:info@restaurant.com">info@Restaurant.com</a>. </p>
<p><b>Choice/Opt-out</b> </p>
<p>Our users are given the opportunity to "opt-out" of receiving communications 
from Restaurant.com by sending us an e-mail at <a href="mailto:info@restaurant.com">info@Restaurant.com</a>. 
</p>
<p><b>Notification of Changes </b></p>
<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes under 
the appropriate link on the "home page" of our Website so our users are always 
aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances, 
if any, we disclose it. The new terms shall be effective immediately upon being 
posted on the Website. It is the responsibility of each user to review the latest 
terms from time to time, and if any user does not agree with any updates to the 
privacy policy, such user should immediately cease use of the Website and any 
purchased services. <br>
