      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <h4>Our Commitment to Your Privacy</h4>
      <p>Your privacy is important to resellrightsonline.com. To
better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our
online information practices and the choices you can make about the way
your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to
find, we make it available on these pages and at every point where
personally identifiable information may be requested.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
      <br>
      <b>The Information We Collect</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
      <br>
This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the
resellrightsonline.com website. On some pages, you can order products,
make requests, and register to receive materials or make use of our
private forums. The types of personal information collected at these
pages may be any or all of the following:<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
      <br>
Name<br>
Address<br>
Phone Number<br>
Email Address<br>
IP Address (required for use on our private forum)<br>
Credit/Debit Card Information<br>
      <br>
      <br>
The credit and payment services we utilize to process your order have
their own privacy statements which may be different from those found
here at resellrightsonline.com. It is therefore recommended that you
carefully read the privacy statements located on these other sites to
help protect your privacy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
      <br>
      <b>How We Use Your Information</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
      <br>
We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order
only to complete that order. We do not share this information with
outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
      <br>
We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an
order only to ship the product and to confirm delivery. We do not share
this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to
complete that order.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
      <br>
We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such
addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with
outside parties or collected in a database.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
      <br>
You can register with our website if you would like to receive updates
on our new products and services. Information you submit on our website
will not be used for this purpose unless you fill out the registration
form.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
      <br>
We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our
website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an
advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our
website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our
registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be
used to identify those individuals.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
      <br>
Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information
provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above
without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise
prohibit such unrelated uses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
      <br>
      <b>Our Commitment to Your Data Security</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
      <br>
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the
correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical,
electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the
information we collect online.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
      <br>
      <b>Our Commitment to Children's Privacy</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
      <br>
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important to us
at resellrightsonline.com. And for that reason, we never collect or
maintain information at our website from those we actually know are
under the age of 13. No part of our website is structured to attract
anyone under the age of 13.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
      <br>
Also, if we hear of, are informed of, or are witness to any illegal
activity with, to, or directed at children, we will promptly report
such parties to the proper authorities for prosecution.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
