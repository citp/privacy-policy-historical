What Personal Information About Customers Does Research and Markets Gather?

The information we learn from customers helps us personalise and continually improve your delivery of business information. 

###### Here are the types of information we gather:

  * _Information You Give Us:_ We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customising future shopping for you, improving our products, and communicating with you.

  * _Automatic Information:_ We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies", and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses Research and Markets.

_Note:_ Your browsing and purchasing patterns for market research information may be commercially sensitive. We recognise this. A number of companies offer utilities designed to help you visit Web sites anonymously. Although we will not be able to provide you with a personalised experience at Research and Markets if we cannot recognise you, we want you to be aware that these tools exist.

  * _E-mail Communications:_ To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from Research and Markets if your computer supports such capabilities. We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your Customer Communication Preferences.

  * _Information from Other Sources:_ We might receive information about you or your organisation from other sources and add it to our account information.
