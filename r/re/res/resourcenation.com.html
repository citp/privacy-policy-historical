<p>OVERVIEW</p>
<p><strong>Request for Quote forms</strong><br>
Resource Nation, Inc. allows businesses and consumers to request price quotes for certain services. In order to request a quote, you must first complete the quote request form to provide us with your name, company name, title, phone number, address and email address. After you complete the form, Resource Nation will identify and match you with NO MORE THAN 6 vendors that may be qualified to provide a price quote. We then forward this information to each of the matched vendors, and each of those vendors should contact you directly to provide price quotes for the requested service category. Vendors will usually contact you via phone or e-mail. The Vendors may require additional information in order to provide you with an accurate quote.</p>
<p>Every vendor in the Resource Nation network has entered into an electronic contract with us. Our contract with the vendors prohibits them from selling your information to any third party, or using your information for any reason other than providing a quote and providing you the agreed service (if you reach agreement with the vendor).</p>
<p>Resource Nation may follow up with you via phone or e-mail to confirm your project information, request missing information, or otherwise communicate with you in order to best provide our matching service.</p>
<p>Resource Nation collects personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on our Web site (see "Information Collection and Use" below).</p>
<p><strong>Vendor sign up form</strong><br>
Vendors may request to join the Resource Nation network by filling out a form and agreeing to our Vendor contract. By filling out the form and agreeing to the contract, the Vendor gives us permission to forward the Vendor's information to businesses or consumers who have requested quotes for service in categories you have requested to receive leads. The Vendor's personal identifying information will not be sold to any third parties.</p>
<p>Resource Nation may communicate or promote the fact that the Vendor's company is a member of the Resource Nation network.</p>
<p>Resource Nation collects personally identifiable information from Vendors at several different points on our Web site.</p>
<p><strong>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE ResourceNation.COM WEBSITE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Special offers and updates</strong><br>
We will occasionally send you information on new services, special offers, and information articles/newsletters. Out of respect for your privacy, we offer you the opportunity not to receive these types of communications. Please see "Choice and Opt-out" below.</p>
<p><strong>Newsletters</strong><br>
All users who request a quote will be added to our newsletter distribution. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe.  Users may opt-out of newsletters or any other communication from Resource Nation by clicking opt-out on the newsletter or simply sending an e-mail to info@resourcenation.com.  Please see the "Choice and Opt-out" section below.</p>
<p><strong>Customer service</strong><br>
Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you an e-mail with a list of the vendors who we have matched to provide you with price quotes. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, to manage your account, and to obtain missing information. We will communicate with you by email or telephone, in accordance with your wishes.</p>
<p><strong>INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Profile</strong><br>
We store information that we collect through cookies, log files and clear gifs, to create a "profile" of your preferences. We tie your personally identifiable information, and your purchasing history, to information in the profile, in order to provide tailored promotions and marketing offers and to improve the content of the site for you.</p>
<p>We do not share your profile with any third parties, although we will pass the information you provide in the quote request form to NO MORE THAN 6 vendors for each category you request services.</p>
<p><strong>Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</strong><br>
We share aggregated demographic information about our user base with our partners and advertisers. This information does not identify individual users. This information is used to recruit vendors into our vendor network. Typical information shared with vendors may include the number of quote requests, the popular geographic locations of quote requests, and the type of quote requests. We do not share personally identifying information except with Vendors for the specific quote requests that have been matched.</p>
<p>We do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable information.</p>
<p><strong>Personally identifiable information</strong><br>
We DO NOT Share Personally Identifiable Information with third parties, EXCEPT for the NO MORE THAN 6 vendors we match your quote request.</p>
<p><strong>Legally Required Disclaimer</strong><br>
We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information if required to comply with a judicial proceedings, court order, or other legal process.</p>
<p><strong>CHILDREN</strong><br>
Children (persons under the age of 18) are not eligible to use Resource Nation's services.</p>
<p><strong>Log files</strong><br>
As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.</p>
<p>We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the ResourceNation.com website, to track users' movements around our website and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.</p>
<p>We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information with the exception of IP address. IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information so we can attempt to ensure that we are not sending duplicate leads to vendors, and affiliates are not spamming our system or sending erroneous quote requests.</p>
<p>We use a third-party tracking service that uses cookies and log files to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate which is standard information collected for most websites in order to track the effectiveness of our website and identify opportunities for improvement. An example of a tracking service we use on our site is Google Analytics.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site.</p>
<p><strong>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</strong><br>
Our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs) that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see "Choice and Opt-out" below.</p>
<p><strong>Ownership of Data</strong><br>
Resource Nation is the sole owner of the information collected on ResourceNation.com. Resource Nation collects personally identifiable information from our website visitors at several different points on our Web site.</p>

However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send email us at <a href="mailto:info@ResourceNation.com">info@ResourceNation.com</a>.</p>
