  * To a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceeding); and

## **NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION**

### Non-Personal Information We Collect

**"Non-Personal Information"** is any information that does not reveal your specific identity, such as:

  * Browser information
  * Server log files
  * Information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other technologies
  * Demographic information and other non-personally identifiable information provided by you and
  * Aggregated information.



### How We Collect Non-Personal Information

We and our third-party service providers may collect Non-Personal Information in a variety of ways, including:

  * **Through your browser:** Certain information is collected by most browsers, such as your Media Access Control ("MAC") address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, and the type and version of your operating system and browser.
  

  * **Through server log files:** An Internet Protocol ("IP") address is a number that is automatically assigned to a computer by an Internet Service Provider ("ISP"), and is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user visits the Site, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited. We and our service providers use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose server problems and administering the Site.
  

  * **Using cookies:** Cookies allow a web server to transfer data to a computer for recordkeeping and other purposes. We and our service providers use cookies and other technologies to, among other things, enhance and personalize your online browsing and shopping experience and facilitate your ongoing access to and use of the Site, as well as for online tracking purposes. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to decline the use of cookies. To learn more about cookies, please visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org/. If you choose to decline cookies, some or all of the features, functionality and promotions available through the Site − such as the shopping cart, ability to view certain pages of the Site, and even placing orders or reviewing your order history − may not be available to you.
  

  * **Flash Local Stored Objects:** We and our service providers may use a third-party technology, called Flash, in connection with the Site or our online content. Flash provides a facility, referred to as Local Stored Objects ("LSO"), that allows a website operator or online content provider (or their service providers) to store certain information locally on an individual's computer; for example, Flash LSOs can be used to store information regarding an individual's computer. If you do not want Flash LSOs stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using the Website Storage Settings Panel. You can also control Flash LSOs by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash LSOs (referred to as "information" on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without you being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash LSOs that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time). Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with the Site or our online content. We expect our service providers and technology suppliers to honor any decision by you to restrict or limit Flash LSOs, but we cannot guarantee that they will do so.
  

  * **Using pixel tags and other similar technologies:** Pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) are small images that may be used by us and our service providers in connection with some Site pages and HTML-formatted email messages to, among other things, render the Site pages to you on various hardware devices and operating system versions, track the actions of Site users and email recipients, measure the success of marketing campaigns and compile statistics about Site usage and response rates. Pixel tags may collect information such as the pages, features and links accessed by a Site visitor, and the IP address, browser type and operating system of such visitor's computer.
  

  * **From you:** We and our service providers may collect demographic information such as your location, as well as other information, such as your preferred means of communication, your gender and your date of birth, when you voluntarily provide this information to us or our service providers. You may also have the opportunity to provide us with information regarding major events such as weddings, child births and the purchase of a new home. We also maintain a record of your orders, purchases, exchanges, returns, wish lists and gift registries in connection with the Site or our businesses. Unless combined with Personal Information, this information does not personally identify you or any other customer or potential customer of our businesses.
  

  * **By aggregating information:** We and our service providers may aggregate Personal Information collected from our customers and potential customers, for example by using Personal Information to calculate the percentage of such individuals who have a particular telephone area code. Aggregated Personal Information does not personally identify you or any other customer or potential customer.



### How We Use and Disclose Non-Personal Information

Because Non-Personal Information does not personally identify you, we may use and disclose Non-Personal Information for any purpose. In some instances, we may combine Non-Personal Information with Personal Information (such as combining your name with your zip code). If we combine any Non-Personal Information with Personal Information, the combined information will be treated by us as Personal Information while it is so combined.

## **THIRD PARTIES AND THIRD PARTY SITES**

To the extent that you submit any Personal Information to any third party (for example, via a third-party software application or service that is included in, available through or linked to from the Site), such third party's collection, use and disclosure of such information may be governed by its privacy policy, and not by our Privacy Policy. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the privacy policies and practices of any such third parties. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INFORMATION COLLECTION, USAGE, DISCLOSURE OR OTHER PRIVACY PRACTICES OF ANY THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING OUR AFFILIATES, THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND ANY THIRD PARTY OPERATING ANY SITE TO WHICH THIS SITE CONTAINS A LINK. THE INCLUSION OF A LINK ON THE SITE DOES NOT IMPLY ENDORSEMENT OF THE LINKED SITE BY US OR BY OUR AFFILIATES.

## **THIRD PARTY ADVERTISERS**

We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Site. Please note that these companies may use information about your visit to the Site to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. In the course of serving advertisements to the Site, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please visit [http://networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp.](http://networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp)

## **SECURITY**

We seek to use reasonable organizational, technical and administrative measures to protect Personal Information under our control. For example, we seek to use Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") technology for the placement of orders. Unfortunately, no data storage system or data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please exercise caution in submitting Personal Information via the Site, especially if you are accessing the Site using a WiFi hotspot or public network. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account that you might have with us has been compromised, or if you are unable to utilize our Site-related SSL technology), please immediately notify us of the problem and place any orders with us over the telephone or in person, instead of using the Site. You may contact us in such circumstances in accordance with the "Contacting Us" section below.

## **CHOICES AND ACCESS**

### Your choices regarding our use and disclosure of your Personal Information

We give you many choices regarding our use and disclosure of your Personal Information for marketing purposes. You may opt-out from:

  * **Receiving promotional emails or catalogs from us:** If you no longer want to receive promotional emails (such as information about new products, special offers and sales events) or catalogs from us on a going-forward basis, you may opt-out of receiving such communications by: clicking the "opt-out" link in any promotional email; clicking the "opt-out" link on the Site, available at: <http://www.restorationhardware.com/customer-service/email-unsubscribe.jsp> for promotional emails, and at <http://www.restorationhardware.com/customer-service/catalog-cancellation.jsp> for catalogs; or by contacting us in accordance with the "Contacting Us" section below. In each case, please remember that, if you wish to opt-out of receiving all promotional emails from Restoration Hardware, you may need to opt-out separately for each Restoration Hardware brand. When so contacting us, please be sure to include your full name and the email and/or postal address that you used when registering or making a purchase. We will seek to process your requests regarding promotional emails within 10 business days, and to process your requests regarding catalogs within 90 days.
  

  * **Our sharing of your Personal Information with Affiliates, Promotional Partners and other third parties for their marketing purposes:** If you no longer want us to share your Personal Information on a going-forward basis with our Affiliates, Promotional Partners and other third parties for their marketing purposes, you may opt-out of such sharing by contacting us in accordance with the "Contacting Us" section below. In so contacting us, please be sure to include your full name and the contact information that you no longer wish to be shared, and state specifically whether you wish to opt-out of such sharing with (a) Affiliates, (b) Promotional Partners and other third parties, or (c) both. We will seek to process your request within 90 days.



We will try to comply with your request(s) as soon as reasonably practicable. Please note that if you opt-out as described above, we will not be able to remove your Personal Information from the databases of our Affiliates, Promotional Partners and other third parties with which we have already shared your Personal Information (i.e., to which we have already provided your Personal Information as of the date that we implement your opt-out request). Please also note that if you do opt-out of receiving marketing-related messages from us, we may still send important administrative messages to you, and you cannot opt-out from receiving such administrative messages. For example, when you place an order, we will continue to confirm your order and shipment status by email. We may also need to contact you via telephone, email or postal mail with information or questions regarding your order.

### How you can access or change your Personal Information

We welcome your willingness to update your information with us. You may review or ask us to update your Personal Information by contacting us in accordance with the "Contacting Us" section below. In your request, please make clear what information you would like to have changed.
