**Scope and Purpose**

This privacy statement is designed to help you understand how the Science business of Thomson Reuters (“Science”) may collect and use personal information about you as a client, or potential client, of our products and services. 

This privacy statement applies to any personal information you may provide to us via Science’s websites (“Web Sites”). These Web Sites provide direct links to other web sites. This privacy statement does not apply to those web sites.

Any information you may provide to our customer support services, whether directly or through one of our Web Sites, will be covered by this privacy statement. That information may include any personal contact information and business-sensitive information such as system information, search strategies and problem descriptions we may need to provide assistance and information to you. 

Some Science products and services also contain personal information. This information may be embedded in the records comprised in those products or services, extracted from those records or obtained directly from the individuals. This privacy statement does not apply to that information, but if you want to find out more about how Science uses personal information in its products and services or ask questions or comment on any of your personal information in our products and services, please contact us using the details provided in the ‘How to contact us’ section below. 

**How we use and share your information**

Similar to other commercial web sites, our Web Sites use standard technology called "cookies" and web server logs to collect information about how the Web Site is used. Cookies are a feature of web browser software that allows web servers to recognize the computer used to access a web site. Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by a user's web browser on the user's hard drive. Information gathered through cookies and web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Web Site, and the web sites visited just before and just after our Web Site. 

In general, you may browse our Web Sites without providing any personal information. If you want to interact with us via the Web Site, Science may ask you to provide us with some personal information. Science employs cookies in order for its server to recognize a return visitor as a unique user. These cookies are placed by the Science server and are readable only by Science - OUR cookies WILL NOT and cannot access, read or modify any other data on YOUR computer. All web-browsers offer the option to refuse or delete any cookie. If a visitor refuses or deletes cookies, Science does not gather any information on that visitor, but doing so will require you to re-enter certain information at each visit, or prevent us from customizing the site's features according to your preferences. Cookies themselves do not contain any personal information. We do link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. You should consult with your browser's provider/manufacturer if you have any questions regarding disabling cookies. 

**Security policy**

Science takes reasonable steps to maintain the security of the personally identifiable information that we collect, including limiting the number of people who have physical access to our database servers, as well as installing electronic security systems that guard against unauthorized access. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure. Accordingly, Science cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us, so you do so at your own risk. 

**Changes to our privacy policy**

From time to time, Science may change our privacy policies. If Science makes a change, it will not affect the choices you have made about any information you gave us before that change. Any changes will be reflected in an updated privacy statement that will be posted on our Web Sites.
