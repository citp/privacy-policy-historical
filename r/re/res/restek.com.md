The websites [www.restek.com](http://www.restek.com/) and [blog.restek.com](http://blog.restek.com/) ("our websites") are owned and operated by Restek (referred to herein as "we," "us," or "our"). The purpose of our privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") is to inform you about the types of personally identifiable information we gather about you when you visit our websites, how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct, the information.

Our use of such data is strictly internal; it is not sold and it is not shared with companies outside of the Restek's distribution network. We strive to make our websites useful and relevant for our customers through ongoing improvement, which depends on understanding how people use them and how they arrived (i.e., referring pages).
