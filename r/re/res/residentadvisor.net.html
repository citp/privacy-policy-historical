Introduction</span> <br> <br>Resident Advisor Limited ("Us", "We", "Our") is the data controller of your Information for the purposes of all applicable data protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (the "Regulation"). <br> <br>We respect your privacy and we are committed to protecting your personal data as more specifically defined in the Regulation ("Information"). We comply with the principles of the Regulation and aim to maintain consistently high levels of best practice in our processing of your personal data.
<br> <br>This Privacy Policy ("Policy") explains how we collect, use and disclose your Information. This Policy is intended to assist you in making informed decisions about your Information when using our website, one of our apps, or using our online Forums (the "Forums)" (collectively the "Online Services").

If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13 years of age please contact us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5b2b29322d3a38221b293e28323f3e352f3a3f2d3228342975353e2f"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="3040425946515349704255435954555e4451544659435f421e5e5544">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a>.
<br> <br>If we change our Policy and/or procedures, we will post those changes on our website to keep you aware of what personal data we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it. We encourage you to review this Policy regularly. <br> <br>In addition to this Policy, each service offered by us or our group companies may have additional privacy provisions that are specific to the particular service. These supplemental disclosures are made adjacent to the particular service at the time your Information is collected. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br><span class="f24">2.

<br> <br>4.1 Ask for a copy of data we are processing about you and have inaccuracies corrected
<br> <br>You have the right to request a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to have any inaccuracies corrected.

<br> <br>4.2 Object to us processing data about you
<br> <br>You can ask us to restrict, stop processing, or to delete your personal data if:
<br> <br>• you consented to our processing the personal data, and have withdrawn that consent;
<br>• we no longer need to process that personal data for the reason it was collected;
<br>• we are processing that personal data because it is in the public interest or it is in order to pursue a legitimate interest of Resident Advisor or a third party, you don't agree with that processing, and there is no overriding legitimate interest for us to continue processing it;
<br>• the personal data was unlawfully processed;
<br>• you need the personal data to be deleted in order to comply with legal obligations;
<br>• the personal data is processed in relation to the offer of a service to a child.
<br> <br>4.3 Obtain a machine readable copy of your personal data, which you can use with another service provider
<br> <br>If we are processing data in order to perform our obligations to you, or because you consented, if that processing is carried out by automated means, we will help you to move, copy or transfer your personal data to other IT systems.
<br> <br>If you request, we will supply you with the relevant personal data in CSV format. Where it is technically feasible, you can ask us to send this information directly to another IT system provider if you prefer
<br> <br>4.4 Make a complaint to a Supervisory Authority
<br> <br>If you are unhappy with the way we are processing your personal data, please let us know by contacting us at email <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7202001b0413110b320017011b16171c061316041b011d005c1c1706"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="9aeae8f3ecfbf9e3dae8ffe9f3fefff4eefbfeecf3e9f5e8b4f4ffee">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a>.
<br> <br>If you do not agree with the way we have processed your data or responded to your concerns, an alternative is to submit a complaint to a Data Protection Supervisory Authority.
