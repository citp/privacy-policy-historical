### Personal Information: Definition and Requirement to Obtain Lawfully

The Department of Parks and Recreation may collect and maintain personal information only through lawful means.

Personal information also includes statements made by, or attributed to, the individual. Specifically it includes information acquired through job applications and employee personnel files, grant applications, contracts for services from individuals, and public comments or questions via mail or electronic mail.

### Restrictions on Collection and Use of Personal Information

The purposes for which the Department of Parks and Recreation may collect personal information will be specified at or prior to the time such information is collected. The personal information collected is relevant to the purpose for which it is needed. Any subsequent use of the information will be limited to and consistent with the fulfillment of those purposes previously specified.

The Department of Parks and Recreation will not disclose, use for any purpose other than as specified at the time it was collected, or make available any personal information collected, except with the written consent of the subject of the information or as otherwise permitted by law or regulation.

The State may provide or distribute certain lists and statistical reports of regulatory information as provided by law, but no personal information is distributed, and all relevant legal protections still apply to the State’s web sites.

### Protection of Personal Information

We strive to protect personal information against loss, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or transfer. The Department of Parks and Recreation employees responsible for the collection, use, maintenance, and/or dissemination of records containing personal information are trained to take appropriate precautions, including but not limited to authentication, monitoring, auditing, and encryption to ensure that proper administrative, technical, and physical safeguards are established and followed in order to protect the confidentiality of such information. Employees are trained to remove or redact personal information when data disclosures are necessary.
