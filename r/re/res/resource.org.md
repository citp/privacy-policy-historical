## Information Public.Resource.Org gathers and tracks

Public.Resource.Org collects two kinds of information about users: 1) data that users volunteer by signing up to receive news, participate in discussion groups, completing surveys, or donate to us; and 2) aggregated tracking data we collect when users interact with us. 

## Personal information

We use the personal information you provide voluntarily to send information you've requested. The specific use of your personal information varies, depending on how you contact us:

  * When you sign up online to receive Public.Resource.Org Network newsletters, Public.Resource.Org product and company news, and to participate in talkbacks on our sites you must provide your name, email address, and a password. We never sell or rent your email address or other personally identifiable information you provide us under these circumstances.
  * When you register for an Public.Resource.Org conference, or sign up for a conference email list, we will send you email announcements and updates about Public.Resource.Org conferences. We send conference brochures to past conference attendees.



We share your information only as described below: 

  * We release personal information when we believe that release is appropriate to comply with the law, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Public.Resource.Org Media, our users, or others. This may include exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
