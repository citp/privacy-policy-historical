We may sell, rent, or share information about user behavior in the aggregate only.

  * You can delete your data at any time-- all of it, or just a slice of it. You can also delete your account at any time. 
  * We won't spam you, ever. We might occasionally send one-time messages about important RescueTime news. We will likely continue to introduce ways that you can optionally have RescueTime contact you with data that you care about, but you'll always be able to turn this on or off. 
  * Other users can't see any of your data or personal information. In the future, we might introduce a groups/team functionality, where individuals can opt into sharing data, but this will be voluntary and opt-in only.
