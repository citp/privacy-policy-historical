        <h1>Statement on Privacy and Data Protection</h1>

        <h2>SECTION I: General</h2>

        <p>This Statement is an addition to the <a href="application.TermsAndConditions.html">Terms and Conditions</a>. Therefore,
            the general definitions and provisions of the Terms and Conditions apply.
        </p>

        <p>The Provider operates the Service in full compliance with the Directive 95/46/EC and the German laws on privacy and data
            protection. The Provider respects your privacy and therefore protects your personal data. ResearchGate is not one a Web
            service that exists primarily in order to collect personal data.
        </p>

        <p>For your convenience, the Provider has arranged all information on privacy and data protection in a "Questions &amp;
            Answers" section. Nevertheless, this statement is a binding agreement between the Provider and each User. The User
            expressly consents to storage and processing of his/her personal data, as described and defined in this statement.
        </p>

        <h2>SECTION II: Master Data</h2>

        <h3>What is master data?</h3>

        <p>
            Master data, in this statement, means all data related directly to a User as a person, irrespective of your actual usage
            of the Service. This includes i.e. a User’s name, email address and other contact information, birthday, gender,
            research vita, information about what conferences the User attends and what ResearchGate Groups the User is a member of.
        </p>

        <h3>What master data is collected and stored by ResearchGate?</h3>

        <p>
            ResearchGate stores data you enter and submit on the Web service; i.e., if you submit your academic career to your
            profile page, ResearchGate will store it. Or, if you join a group or a conference, ResearchGate will store that
            information.
        </p>

        <h3>What master data is processed by ResearchGate and why?</h3>

        <p>
            ResearchGate will process your data in order to run the Web service, for example, if any internet user visits your
            profile page, we process your data in order to show your profile page. Very basic data (e.g. your name) is visible to
            all users. However, you can choose to make most of your data only visible to your closer friends. ResearchGate will also
            process your master data randomly to provide dynamic Web pages to you that are individually adapted considering your
            master data. Furthermore, ResearchGate reserves the right to process your master data to generate anonymous statistics.
            Such anonymous statistics will contain no information about any individual user.
        </p>

        <h3>Does ResearchGate process my email adress and send emails?</h3>

        <p>
            ResearchGate will process your email address solely to send emails to you containing information or notifications about
            the Service. ResearchGate reserves the right to attach a minor part to such emails containing advertisements for
            products and services of any third party.
        </p>

        <h3>How can I see what master data is stored and how can I change or delete it?</h3>

        <p>
            You can see and edit your data on your profile pages. You can also delete all your master data but your name, your
            email address and your password. If you cancel your ResearchGate subscription (if you wish to do so, please contact
            ResearchGate by email, mail or fax), we will delete all your data. Unlike some other Web services, ResearchGate will
            definitely not store any personal data of former users.
        </p>

        <h2>SECTION III: Traffic Data</h2>

        <h3>What is traffic data?</h3>

        <p>
            Traffic data is data about your ResearchGate usage. This is mainly tracking information on log-in times, duration, and
            activities while logged in Traffic data also includes your IP address/es and information sent automatically by your Web
            browser such as your browser software, preferred languages, and the name of your operating system.
        </p>

        <h3>
            What traffic does ResearchGate collect and store?
        </h3>

        <p>
            ResearchGate collects your traffic data, as defined before, and will store that data for the duration of your session (a
            session starts when you log in and ends when you log out. The session automatically times out after approx. 60 minutes
            of inactivity). After your session ends, ResearchGate reserves the right to store traffic data for one day. During that
            period, your data is only connected to your IP address and not to your user account, which has your personal
            information. ResearchGate will not be able to attach any individual user’s name to traffic data. However, it is possible
            that someone else (i.e., your internet service provider) could do so. After this one day, ResearchGate will only store
            information about how many profile pages you viewed within thirty days. Only the number of pages are saved. Information
            about which pages you have viewed and when are not stored.
        </p>

        <h3>
            What traffic data is processed by ResearchGate and why?
        </h3>

        <p>
            During your session, ResearchGate needs to process traffic data to provide the Web service. After the session,
            ResearchGate reserves the right to process traffic data (within one day, as mentioned above) to generate anonymous
            statistics. ResearchGate uses this information to improve its services and user experience. ResearchGate may also
            process traffic data for security and fraud-detection reasons. The number of profile pages you viewed is a security
            measure for the protection of personal data. Processing this information helps ResearchGate detect and prevent "data
            harvesting", meaning automatic retrieval of profile pages to gain many users’ personal data.
        </p>

        <h3>
            How can I view stored traffic data, change or delete it?
        </h3>

        <p>
            Please contact the ResearchGate support team for any requests related to viewing, changing or deleting your traffic
            data. When you cancel your ResearchGate subscription, we automatically delete your personal traffic data.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Does ResearchGate use external tracking software?
        </h3>

        <p>
            We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service operated
            by Google, Inc., California, USA (“Google”). Google processes the data on behalf of ResearchGate. Google Analytics uses cookies,
            which are text files placed on your computer to help the website analyze how individuals use the site. Any information generated
            by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers
            in the United States of America. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the site, compiling
            reports on website activity for website operators, and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage.
            Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law.
            For Google Analytics, your IP address will be masked by truncating the last octet, in order to protect your privacy. More
            information about data privacy &amp; security in Google Analytics can be found
            <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://support.google.com/analytics/topic/2919631">here</a>.
            Please see <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/">Google’s terms and policies</a> for further information.
        </p>

        <a name="cookies"></a>

        <h2>SECTION IV: Cookies</h2>

        <h3>
            What are cookies?
        </h3>

        <p>
            Cookies are small pieces of data that a website requests to be stored by your internet browser software on your computer.
            These data are then read by the site whenever you use the website again.
            Cookies can be overwritten and renewed, but if they are not, they expire after a given period of time.
        </p>

        <h3>
            ResearchGate cookies
        </h3>

        <p>
            ResearchGate uses cookies for functionality where the use is strictly necessary.
            The login cookie is set when you select “Keep me logged in” on the login dialog.
            If the cookie is set, you don’t need to log in manually on the same computer (using the same browser) each time you visit the
            ResearchGate website.
            While this is convenient, it’s also a security risk: anyone with access to the computer may log in to your ResearchGate account
            without a password.
            Thus, you must not tick the “Keep me logged in” box on a computer not used exclusively by you.
        </p>

        <p>We also use targeting cookies so we can show you content that best suits you and is tailored to your scientific interests.</p>

        <h3>
            Cookies from third parties
        </h3>

        <p>
            The ResearchGate website may contain embedded content from third parties. When your internet browser downloads such embedded
            content, the remote server that hosts that content can set and read cookies (but it can only read cookies from that exact third
            party).
        </p>

        <p>
            ResearchGate reserves the right to use certain Google services, operated by Google, Inc., California, USA (“Google”). The Google
            services may include Google Analytics, a web analytics service, Google Analytics Advertising Features, namely for Remarketing
            with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting, and
            integrated services that require Google Analytics to collect data via advertising cookies and anonymous identifiers, and
            Google’s DoubleClick Services. Google uses cookies to help analyze how individuals use the site. Any information generated by
            the cookies about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in
            the United States of America. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the site, compiling
            reports on website activity for website operators, and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage.
            Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law. Your IP address will be masked in
            order to protect your privacy by truncating the last octet. More
            information about data privacy &amp; security in Google Analytics can be found
            <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://support.google.com/analytics/topic/2919631">here</a>. Please see Google’s page on

        </p>

        <p>
            If you decide to log in through your Facebook or LinkedIn account (but only then), the respective provider may read or set
            cookies. Both Facebook Inc. and LinkedIn Corporation are companies located in California, USA. See the Facebook and LinkedIn
            websites for those services’ respective terms and policies.
        </p>

        <p>
            Google, Inc., Facebook Inc., and LinkedIn Corporation are each Safe Harbor certified; they have each notified the U.S.
            Department of Commerce that they adhere to the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce in
            coordination with the European Commission. The U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework provides guidance for U.S. organizations on how to
            provide adequate protection for personal data from the EU as required by the European Union's Directive on Data Protection.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Limiting the use of Cookies
        </h3>

        <p>
            Most internet browsers allow you to adjust cookies acceptance settings, i.e. not to store cookies persistently. You are usually
            able to see the content of cookies and delete certain or all cookies. Many browsers also offer an ‘incognito mode’ that does not
            accept persistent cookies. Please consult your browser’s help section (or use a search engine) if you need assistance with these
            browser features.
        </p>

        <h2>SECTION V: Private Messages</h2>

        <h3>
            How does ResearchGate process private messages?
        </h3>

        <p>
            Messages sent privately within ResearchGate will be processed in order to deliver them to the respective recipient(s).
            ResearchGate may also process the message (including eventual attachments) randomly in order to investigate it and
            extract information, such as – but not necessarily limited to – anti-SPAM and anti-virus checking. Results of such
            processing (but not the message content itself) may be stored permanently for ResearchGate’s own purposes. ResearchGate
            respects the confidentiality of private communications, therefore, the process is fully automated and, unless the fully
            automated processing indicates a security threat or abusive behavior, no person but the recipient(s) will be cognizant
            of the message.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Will ResearchGate share private messages with third parties?
        </h3>

        <p>
            Private messages will generally not be shared with any third party. ResearchGate may nevertheless be obliged to share or
            grant access to private messages if ordered to do so by a court or a competent judicial authority.
        </p>

        <h2>SECTION VI: Transmission of data</h2>

        <h3>
            Will ResearchGate sell personal data to any third parties?
        </h3>

        <p>
            No. ResearchGate will not sell or otherwise share personal data.
        </p>

        <h3>
            What about other third parties processing data on behalf of ResearchGate?
        </h3>

        <p>
            ResearchGate reserves the right to appoint third parties to certain tasks, such as database or software development. For
            that purpose, it might be necessary for personal data to be shared with and processed by such third parties. In this
            case, ResearchGate remains fully responsible for your personal data and will bind any and all third parties to a written
            agreement ensuring they comply with this statement on privacy and data protection. ResearchGate is committed to its
            user's privacy, hence we are dedicated to choosing a contractor that is trustworthy, and who will operate under the
            legal regime of the Directive 95/46/EC.
        </p>

        <h2>SECTION VII: Privacy and Data Protection Supervision</h2>

        <h3>
            Whom can I contact if I have a request or complaint about Privacy or Data Protection?
        </h3>

        <p>
            ResearchGate considers privacy and data protection to be very important issues, as they directly affect the trust
            between us and our valued users. Therefore, ResearchGate has implemented specific measures to supervise data protection
            issues. For any requests or complaints relating to privacy and data protection, please directly contact the data
            protection officer, Mr. Jay Monahan.
        </p>

        <h2>SECTION VIII: Changes to Statement on Privacy and Data Protection</h2>

        <h3>
            How does ResearchGate notify Users of changes in this Statement on Privacy and Data Protection?
        </h3>

        <p>
            By using the Service, you expressly agree to this Statement on Privacy and Data Protection.
        </p>

        <p>
