          <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties or individuals that we do not own, control, manage or employ, including, but not limited to, restaurants in the Reserve network (each, a "Restaurant") or any other third party websites, services, or applications that you chose to access or use through the Services or that you chose to use to interact with through the Services.

          <p><strong>Request and Reservation Information</strong></p>
          <p>When you use the Services to request and book reservations at Restaurants, whether with an account or as a guest user, we may also collect and store information related to such requests and reservations including, but not limited to, your first and last name, your phone number, your email, information related to completed reservations, and information Restaurants provide to us when you interact with through the Services (collectively, "Reservation Information").

          <p><strong>Usage Information</strong></p>

          <p><strong>Storage and Security of Your Information</strong></p>
          <p>Your information collected through the Services may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Reserve or its subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities. Reserve may transfer information that we collect about you, including Personal Information, to affiliated entities, or to other third parties across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.  If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or any other country in which Reserve or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <p>The information we collect is securely stored within our databases, and we use standard, industry-wide, commercially reasonable security practices such as encryption, firewalls and SSL (Secure Socket Layers) for protecting your information, such as any portions of your credit card number which we retain (we do not ourselves retain your full credit card information) and reservation information. To be clear, Reserve does not itself store your full credit or debit card information and we do not have direct control over or responsibility for your debit or credit card information. Our contracts with our third party payment processors that receive your credit or debit card information require them to keep it secure.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, as effective as encryption technology is, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our databases or our third party payment processors' databases, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us and/or to our third party payment processors over the Internet or via wireless communication, and any information you transmit to Reserve is done at your own risk. We assume no liability or responsibility for disclosure of your information due to errors in transmission, unauthorized third party access, or other causes beyond our control. </p>
          <p>You also play an important part in keeping your Personal Information secure. You are responsible for selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your Devices and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account. We also recommend that you not disclose your password to anyone.</p>
          <p><strong>Viewing, Changing, and Deleting Your Account Information</strong></p>
          <p>If you have created an account with Reserve, you can view and change your account information by signing into the Services and are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information you submit to us, such as your contact information provided as part of your account registration. You may also remove or update your photo at anytime by signing into your account. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you with the Services, you can also contact us at <a href="mailto:support@reserve.com">support@reserve.com</a>. </p>
          <p>As noted above, you may opt-out of receiving SMS text messages at any time by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@reserve.com">support@reserve.com</a> or by texting STOP in response to the text messages you receive. However, by opting-out of receiving SMS text messages, we may have to temporarily suspend your account, during which time you will no longer be able to use the Services. </p>
          <p>We will retain your information for as long as your account with Reserve is active and as is needed to provide you the Services. Even after your account is terminated, we may retain your information (including, but not limited to, Personal Information and Usage Information) as needed to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations, resolve disputes, conclude any activities related to cancellation of an account (such as addressing chargebacks from your credit card companies), investigate or prevent fraud and other inappropriate activity, to enforce our agreements, and for other business reasons. After a period of time, your data may be anonymized and aggregated, and then may be held by us as long as necessary for us to provide our Services effectively. </p>
          <p><strong>Your Choices About Your Information</strong></p>
          <p>You may, of course, decline to provide us with some or all of your Personal Information, but keep in mind that without certain Personal Information we may not be able to provide you with the Services or certain features of the Services.  </p>
          <p><strong>Children's Privacy</strong></p>
          <p>Our Services are not directed to children under 13 years old. Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Reserve does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register for the Services. If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information to or on Reserve. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@reserve.com">support@reserve.com</a>.</p>
          <p><strong>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</strong></p>
          <p>We're constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time and reserve the right to do so. If we change this Privacy Policy, we will post those changes so as to keep you informed as to what information we collect and how we are using and disclosing that information. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when posted on this page, as indicated by the Last Updated date at the top of this page. By continuing to access or use the Services after a change in this Privacy Policy has been posted, you are agreeing to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
          <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or any of our privacy-related practices, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@reserve.com">support@reserve.com</a>.</p>
