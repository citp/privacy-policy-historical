Our privacy policy explains how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use our Services. By accessing our website, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use. The information contained on Reshareworthy.com is for informational purposes only.

This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which DiscoverMe Technologies, Inc. collects, uses, maintains and discloses information collected from users (each, a “User”) of the http://www.reshareworthy.com website (“Site”). This privacy policy applies to the Site and all products and services (“Services”) offered by DiscoverMe Technologies, Inc. (“DiscoverMe”).

When visiting Reshareworthy.com, we collect no personally identifiable data about you as a visitor. The only exception is when you provide your email address to subscribe to our electronic newsletter, which you can opt out of at any time.

We do not sell, misuse, or otherwise jeopardize your data in any way. Our advertisers may use cookies to serve you better ads (see “Advertising” below).

We use the anonymous information we collect to try to provide a safe, efficient, and customized experience. Here are some of the details on how we do that:

  * **To manage the service.** We use the information we collect to provide our services and features to you, to measure and improve those services and features provided to you. We use the information to prevent potentially illegal activities. We also use a variety of technological systems to detect and address anomalous activity and screen content to prevent abuse such as spam. These efforts may on occasion result in a temporary or permanent suspension or termination of some functions for some users.
  * **To contact you.** For those that have subscribed to our daily newsletter, we may contact you with service-related announcements from time to time.



We do not sell, trade, or rent Users personal identification information to others. We may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal identification information regarding visitors and users with our business partners, trusted affiliates and advertisers for the purposes outlined above.

We may use third party service providers to help us operate our business and the Site or administer activities on our behalf, such as sending out newsletters. We may share your information with these third parties for those limited purposes provided that you have given us your permission.
