# Responsible Travel privacy policy.

We are committed to providing you with the best information on how to travel responsibly, and to protecting your privacy. 

**Emails**

We will email you when you make an enquiry through responsibletravel.com, responsiblevaction.com or via our Help Desk with the details of your enquiry and contact details for the holiday companies that can take your enquiry further. After this transaction, we will email you with other ideas for your trip along with news and articles. We will try to make sure that the content of these transactional emails is relevant to you. 

You can easily unsubscribe from our emails by either clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails or by calling us on 01273 823700 (UK) or sending an email to [rosy@responsibletravel.com](mailto:rosy@responsibletravel.com). We also have an update your preferences link at the bottom of most of our emails. Here, you can choose how often you would like to hear from us and what sort of emails you would like to receive. 

We will never sell or lease your personal details to anyone else. The only details we keep on our database are names and email addresses. If you would like to update any of your details or check what details we have on our database, please email [rosy@responsibletravel.com](mailto:rosy@responsibletravel.com). 

**Information collected by Responsible Travel**

You do not need to enter any personal information to browse Responsible Travel. If you do decide to make an enquiry, we then need an email address. We pass this on to the holiday company who runs the trip you are enquiring about. We may also ask for your phone number as this could be useful to the holiday company in case they need to verify your email address or can’t reach you via email. We will only collect your postal address if you ask us to send you a brochure or written materials. If we do collect your phone number and/or postal address from you we promise it will be automatically deleted two months later. So to clarify, the only information that we will hold about you is your name and email address. This information is held on a very secure server and our firewalls are regularly updated and can only be accessed by Responsible Travel staff or our IT supplier. 

**Cookies and IP addresses**

Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to a visitor’s computer for record keeping purposes. Nearly all sites on the internet use cookies. We use cookies to tell us how and when you use our websites. This helps us understand the most and least popular features of our sites so that we can improve and update the sites, and allows us to show you information relevant to your visit. Responsible Travel will provide aggregated and anonymous data to advertisers, our partners and other third parties. Responsible Travel may also collect IP addresses of those browsing our sites. Again, this is just another way of understanding how our sites are used so that we can improve them. 

We may use your cookie, collected while you were browsing our sites, to advertise targeted holiday ideas relevant to you whilst you are on third party sites, such as social media platforms and Google. You can opt out of seeing these adverts by changing the settings within your social media or search engine provider accounts. You can opt out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting the Google advertising [opt-out](https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/) page. You can also opt out of allowing a third party vendor to use your cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative [opt out](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/) page. 

In addition to using this data to improve the site we also use this information to send you relevant follow-up emails. These act as a reminder of what you have viewed on the site and suggest similar holidays you may be interested in. You can opt out of these by clicking on the update your preferences link in the email. If you opt out of this type of email you will not receive any further follow-up emails when browsing our websites. However, you may still receive emails relating to specific enquiries or bookings you made through the site. You will automatically be re-subscribed to transactional emails when you make any subsequent enquiry. 

**Sharing of data with our partners**

If you request information from one of our tour operator or accommodation owner partners, either by making an enquiry on our site or by contacting our Help Desk, we will pass on your contact details to them so that they can reply to your request. On occasion, we will also pass this information on to other partners who offer similar trips, so you have more options. We cannot be held responsible for the privacy practices of our partners. Responsible Travel will provide aggregated, anonymous data to advertisers, our members and other third parties. This data cannot be linked to any individual and again, we will not sell or lease your information to any other party. Third party links In order to give you the best information on travelling responsibly we will provide links to other sites containing relevant information. Responsible Travel is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these sites. 

We hope this helps reassure you that we keep the minimum amount of your data on file and that it is stored safely. We are committed to using your data carefully, and to only sending you relevant adverts and emails, and we are also committed to your privacy.
