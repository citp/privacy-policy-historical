If you decide to use the site to request information from a member of Responsible Travel we will capture your e-mail address, and either your telephone number or address depending on what information you have requested. This information will be passed to the tour operator or accommodation owner member from whom you have requested information in order for them to reply to your request. If you use the site to send trip or accommodation details to a friend, we will add you to our e-magazine mailing list.
