    <p>We recognize that every visitor to RenéeRouleau.com (the "Site") is concerned about maintaining privacy. Therefore, it is our goal to make each visitor feel secure about accessing and using our Site. Set forth below is an explanation of what information Renée Rouleau collects through the services available on our Site, how we use that information, how you can opt out of certain uses of information we may collect, and a description of the policies we have adopted to help meet your privacy concerns.</p>
<p>PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>Personal information includes your name, address, email address, demographic information, hobbies and activities, product preferences, and the like, which you voluntarily submit to us. The Site uses this information to respond to specific inquiries and requests that you make to our Customer Service Department, provide you with service and support, and maintain the security and integrity of our systems. If you agree, we may use this information to send you product samples, sale coupons, product literature, or new product information. We also collect and store access information related to your account, including email address and password. When you make purchases from our Site, we may collect purchasing information such as product orders, shipping address(es), and credit card information. We use this information to open, maintain, administer, and service your account or membership, as well as to process, service, or enforce transactions you make through our Site.</p>
<p>STATISTICAL USE</p>
<p>We may use information about you for our own internal statistical, design, or operational purposes, such as to estimate our audience size, measure aggregate traffic patterns, and understand demographic, customer interest, purchasing, and other trends among our guests and customers. From time to time we may post surveys on our Site. The surveys may request demographic information (such as age range, gender, areas of interest, and familiarity with Renée Rouleau channels, products, and services) and customer feedback. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary, and with each request you will have the choice of whether or not to disclose information. Such survey information will be used to improve the overall experience on the Site. We may use your personal information to create a convenient and easy-to-use shopping process that includes an online "shopping basket" that allows you to track selected products and proceed through purchase. Also, we may share transactional information with entities as necessary to process credit card payments or other purchasing or delivery systems. Finally, as our business develops, it may sell or buy corporate assets; in such transactions, customer information may be one of the business assets transferred. If Renée Rouleau, its Internet businesses, or substantially all of its assets, is acquired, customer information may be one of the assets transferred. We may outsource all of these tasks to third parties on a confidential basis. Additionally, any information you have given us about your demographics and personal and product preferences may be aggregated with other information to help us analyze how to better develop, market, and promote our products.</p>
<p>REMINDER</p>
<p>The Site will not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you provide it. Therefore, if you do not want the Site to obtain any personally identifiable information about you, do not submit it.</p>
<p>DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>Except as disclosed in this policy, we do not sell or disclose information that identifies our customers personally or makes it possible for other parties to contact them directly without our customers' consent unless we are required to do so by law or as disclosed to you when we request the information from you. We may disclose personal information for the following purposes: (1) to conform with the law, respond to claims, or comply with legal process served on Renée Rouleau (e.g. a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); (2) to enforce or apply our policies or agreements (including to initiate, render, bill, and collect for amounts owed to us); (3) to protect and defend our or our users' rights or property, the Site, our employees, customers or the public, including fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of our Site; or (4) if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure of records without delay.</p>
<p>COOKIES</p>
<p>We may make use of "cookies" on our Site. Cookies are small text files that are stored on a user's computer by a Web server based on the permissions set in a user's browser software.

Therefore, cookies only identify the user's computer to the website, which may correlate other information, including personally identifying information, with the cookie. We use cookies to allow us to automate access and data entry functions of our Site such as to correlate online ordering information for purchases you may make while at the Site (if any), tailor the Site to your preferences or interests, or customize promotions or marketing.

The advertisers and/or other content providers that may appear on this website may also use cookies that are not sent by the Site. Such ads or content may contain cookies that help track and target the interests of users of this website in order to present "personalized" advertisements or other messages that the user might find interesting.

          <p>Renée Rouleau is a celebrity esthetician with 25 years of experience. Early on, Renée recognized that every person’s skin is unique; however, the skin care industry mostly relied on a one-size-fits-all approach to skin care.</p>
          <p>So Renée began formulating her own line of products based on nine distinct skin types to ensure her clients achieved the results they desired. Healthy, beautiful and glowing skin. Welcome to Renée Rouleau.</p>
