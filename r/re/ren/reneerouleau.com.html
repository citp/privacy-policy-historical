From time to time we may post surveys on our Site. The surveys may request demographic information (such as age range, gender, areas of interest, and familiarity with Renee Rouleau channels, products, and services) and customer feedback. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary, and with each request you will have the choice of whether or not to disclose information. Such survey information will be used to improve the overall experience on the Site. We may use your personal information to create a convenient and easy-to-use shopping process that includes an online "shopping basket" that allows you to track selected products and proceed through purchase. Also, we may share transactional information with entities as necessary to process credit card payments or other purchasing or delivery systems. Finally, as our business develops, it may sell or buy corporate assets; in such transactions, customer information may be one of the business assets transferred. If Renee Rouleau, its Internet businesses, or substantially all of its assets, is acquired, customer information may be one of the assets transferred. We may outsource all of these tasks to third parties on a confidential basis. Additionally, any information you have given us about your demographics and personal and product preferences may be aggregated with other information to help us analyze how to better develop, market, and promote our products.</td>
