				<br>

				<h3>COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION</h3>
				<p>In order to ensure that IIC's web sites are useful and effective for its Users, IIC uses log files to analyze information. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track visitor's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. These types of log files are not linked to personal information. IIC uses these statistics to improve site content and usability; this information does not identify visitors personally. Visitors are not required to be IIC or Pro.rentometer.com subscribers in order to gain access to IIC's public web sites, with the exception of specific secured pages. However, when a User enters an IIC subscriber Login Name and Password in order to access to Pro.rentometer.com or other secured pages, a "cookie" may be deployed. If the User clicks "Save Login Information", the User Login Name will be saved in a "cookie" - a small text file stored on the visitor's browser - on the User's computer, so that the User will not have retype the Login Name the next time the User visits the Pro.rentometer.com web site. In addition, the Pro.rentometer.com web site uses the "Secure Sockets Layer" security protocol ("SSL") - a standard industry security technology that protects web communications. The pro.rentometer.com server will write a "temporary cookie" to the User's computer. This cookie enables the web site to "remember" this authentication information during movement from one page to another during a session. This makes it unnecessary to log in again on each page. The temporary cookie only saves assigned identification information for the session and contains no personal information. If you have set your Internet web browser to reject cookies, access may be denied to secured areas of IIC's web sites. IIC also collects limited personal information from Users and prospective Users worldwide in order to provide Pro.rentometer.com services and related services to Users. Examples of this information would be: name, email address, and also other information necessary to process credit card payment for the purchase by Users of subscriptions to Pro.rentometer.com and the purchase of credits and other requested transactions and services on Pro.rentometer.com. In addition, the nature and purpose of Pro.rentometer.com is to organize and store, and subsequently display to User-selected third parties, certain information and files selected by Users, which information is uploaded, in electronic file format, by Users to Pro.rentometer.com. It is the User's choice to include or not include personal information in such files, or to grant permission to third parties to view the User's portfolio. Uploaded files and information are selected and/or created by the User, and can be in virtually any electronic file format (e.g., Word documents, electronic spreadsheets, pdf format files, graphics, video and sound files, and links to other files accessible through the Internet from outside of the Pro.rentometer.com program). Permission to view a User’s real estate advertisements/listings may be enabled in Pro.rentometer.com and may be publicly viewed. Publicly viewed information is determined by the user and is only applicable to real estate advertisements. User detailed portfolio information is not viewable by the public and is protected on secure servers. Protected information includes, mortgage, lease details, tenant data and financial data not disclosed by the User. In addition the user may also choose to keep their personal contact information private while continuing to receive inquiries in private via Pro.rentometer.com servers. This option is selected by the User per property advertisement created. Users may promote and publish links for the purpose of marketing real estate and real estate related services on Pro.rentometer.com. Links may also be transmitted via email to other viewers for the purpose of marketing real estate. Users should be aware that there are laws that govern unsolicited email communications, and Users should seek the consent of the prospective viewer to receive an email from IIC containing a link to Pro.rentometer.com. The permission granted by a User can permit the viewer to provide feedback to the User in the form of comments or an inquiry are sent to the User via Pro.rentometer.com servers. The viewer has the ability to copy or print all or part of the electronic real estate advertisement or to forward the email (with the embedded link) or any of the files in the electronic advertisement to third parties, who would also have the ability to copy, print or forward the information. Transfer of this data to IIC, (i) for storage and display on IIC's servers, (ii) by a User to his or her selected permitted viewers, and (iii) by a viewer to provide inquiries to a User on the User's real estate advertisements, is allowed through the explicit consent of the Users (as subscribers to or licensees/Users of Pro.rentometer.com), and through adherence of IIC to the Safe Harbor Principles. A User who does not desire the transfer of his or her personal information to third parties can prevent such transfer by not including such information in the advertisements created. IIC may access such information for the purposes of obtaining aggregated statistical information regarding use and information stored in Pro.rentometer.com, maintaining Pro.rentometer.com, and responding to service requests, support requests, notices of deficiencies, or operational problems with access to or use of Pro.rentometer.com received from Users or others.</p>

				<br>

				<h3>ACCURACY AND RIGHT OF ACCESS</h3>
				<p>A User has the sole right and power (except in very limited circumstances) to control the selection, correction, storage, access and deletion of any personal information provided for storage in Pro.rentometer.com. Once information becomes part of an electronic portfolio in Pro.rentometer.com, a subscribing User generally will have exclusive control over the correction, continued storage, access and deletion of such information. Pro.rentometer.com subscribers will have access, by logging in to the program, to all information stored in their electronic portfolios during the term of their subscription, and such information may be corrected or deleted, as the subscriber may choose. Subscribers also may view and update their personal account information by accessing the subscriber's account at http://Pro.rentometer.com, available upon login to the subscriber's account. The following paragraphs of this Section of IIC's Privacy Policy ("Accuracy and Right of Access") only apply to personal information other than that stored by Users in the Pro.rentometer.com software site. IIC will use reasonable efforts to ensure that other personal information under its control is as accurate, complete and up-to-date as is necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used. Upon request, IIC will inform an individual as to whether or not IIC holds any personal information about such individual and as to its use and disclosure of such information. If it is not possible to provide a list of the specific organizations to whom information has been disclosed, IIC will provide a list of organizations to whom information may have been disclosed. IIC will provide reasonable access to Users who want to review their personal information maintained by IIC, and to correct any inaccuracies or incompleteness in such information.

Access to personal information also may be requested by emailing feedback@InvestmentInstruments.com or by mailing a request to Investment Instruments Corp. Individuals requesting access should receive confirmation of a request within 2-3 business days. IIC will respond to an individual's request for access within a reasonable time. IIC's response will typically be provided at no cost to the individual, however, IIC reserves the right, depending on the nature of the request, to charge the individual for its costs to process the request and to receive payment of such costs prior to processing such request. If it is demonstrated that personal information is inaccurate or incomplete, IIC will amend the information as required to the extent more accurate information is provided and, if appropriate, will advise third parties having access to the information in question. If a challenge is not resolved to the satisfaction of the individual, IIC will record the substance of the unresolved challenge. IIC is not responsible for verifying the continued accuracy of Users' personal information. In certain circumstances, IIC may be unable to provide access to some or all personal information under its control. Those circumstances will be limited to those permitted or required by applicable law. Where permitted, the reasons for such refusal will be provided to the individual upon request.</p>
				<br>

				<h3>LINKS</h3>
				<p>IIC's web sites contain "links" to other sites, including sites operated by IIC affiliates or their agents. Subscribing Users have the ability to store their own selected web site links in Pro.rentometer.com, as a link in their RentometerPro custom public real estate website available for their individual marketing needs. IIC does not control, and is not responsible for, the content, accuracy, timeliness, security, or the continued availability or existence of outside information. Information or content provided on other sites linked from IIC's web sites, the Pro.rentometer.com program, or in any User's private electronic portfolio or publicly available real estate advertisements/listings or publicly available custom real estate sites, is not necessarily reviewed or screened by IIC, nor does IIC endorse, warrant, or guarantee products or services described or offered on those other sites. IIC is not responsible for the contents of any web sites that choose to link to IIC's web sites with or without IIC's consent. Other organizations linked to IIC's web sites, or through links contained in a User's electronic portfolio, may collect information about you when you view or click on these sites. IIC cannot control this collection of information. You should contact these organizations directly if you have any questions about their use of the information they collect. INFORMATION PROVIDED IN ELECTRONIC PORTFOLIOS TO THIRD PARTIES; RISK OF DISCLOSURE Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information to third parties through electronic communication - by providing email messages, or granting permission to any person to view and have access to your real estate advertisements - that information can be collected and used by others, including making copies or printing of such information and forwarding such information and access to your advertisements or publicly available domain to others. By granting and enabling permission for viewers to view your electronic advertisements, such information, including any sensitive personal information, may be stored, copied, printed, used, published and/or forwarded to others by the viewer, and the privacy of such information cannot be protected. By including sensitive information, such as that pertaining to racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, financial information, or health or sex life, in any electronic advertisement or publicly available domain, you are providing explicit consent to the disclosure of that sensitive information to any viewers that have been granted permission to view your advertisements or public sites. Also, you may receive unsolicited messages from viewers and other parties who obtain access to the information contained in your electronic advertisements or public sites.</p>
				<br>

				<h3>SECURITY</h3>
				<p>Access to a User's RentometerPro portfolios, maintained by IIC, is password-protected so that only the subscribing User may create and manage the User's portfolios. As described above, however, public viewers will have access to any real estate advertisement and real estate marketing pages and viewers may have the ability to provide feedback and inquiries on properties advertised to the subscriber who created the real estate advertisement or public marketing site. IIC may store and process personal information provided by Users, through such Users' subscription to or use of RentometerPro, in the United States or any other country where IIC, its affiliates, agents or transferees are located. IIC staff will have access to Users' portfolios for service, support and maintenance purposes. A subscribing User may edit the User's own information stored in the User's portfolios at any time by logging in with his or her Login Name and Password. IIC strongly urges subscribing Users to not divulge their Login Name and Password to anyone, and to not enable any login storage feature of any web browser or software program, which would permit anyone with access to the subscriber's computer to have access to the subscriber's personal RentometerPro account. IIC also urges Users to completely close their web browser window when they have finished visiting the Pro.rentometer.com web site. This is to ensure that others cannot easily access personal information if the computer is shared or is used at a public place. Subscriber credit card and payment information is not stored in a database or on any servers connected to the Internet. This is to provide the best protection of subscriber payment information. Credit card data transmission in the subscription process is encrypted using SSL or other encryption techniques. IIC has physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in place, including an Information Security Policy, to protect personal information provided to IIC or stored in Pro.rentometer.com from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, alteration and destruction. Although there cannot be a guaranty of the security of personal information provided by Users to IIC or stored in Pro.rentometer.com, IIC believes that its security policies and safeguards are reasonable and appropriate to adequately protect such information, regardless of the format in which such information is held. IIC intends to review and update its security policies and safeguards on a regular basis. IIC requires that its employees keep all personal information confidential and comply with its Information Security Policy and privacy practices. IIC uses reasonable efforts to ensure that upon disposal or destruction of personal information, confidentiality of the information is maintained.</p>
