Rentboard.ca reserves the right to sell, distribute and license data, information, statistics, and reports that are visible to the public. You have a choice of supplying a telephone number, E-mail address or both when entering contact information. The contact information you supply is used by customers to respond to your listing. Your listings may be sent to other rental-related sites for the purpose of giving your listing greater exposure, however all contact information remains on the RentBoard.ca site.

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Our database and our Web server operate separately from each other, and each is protected by an electronic and physical firewall keeping users' data secure.
