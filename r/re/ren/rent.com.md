**Collection of Personally Identifiable Information**

We collect personally identifiable information (name, address, phone number, email address) from you when you set up an account with Rent.com. While you can browse some sections of our site without being a registered member, certain activities (such as searching for properties, viewing property contact information, and registering a property) do require registration. 

Rent.com does not sell, share, or in any other way transmit personally identifiable information (names, address, phone numbers, etc.) to any persons or companies outside Rent.com controlled entities, without your express permission to do so. The Rent.com controlled entities are all subject to the same privacy policy and security measures as Rent.com.

**Use of Demographic and Profile Data**

In our efforts to continually improve our product and service offerings, we collect and analyze demographic and profile data about our users' activity on our Web site. 

We identify and use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information. 

We will occasionally ask you to complete optional online surveys. These surveys may ask you for contact information and demographic information (like zip code, age or income level). We use this data to tailor your experience at our site, providing you with content that we think you might be interested in -- and to display content according to your preferences. 

**Cookies**

A "cookie" is a small piece of information stored by a Web server on a Web browser so it can be later read back from that browser. Cookies are useful for enabling the browser to remember information specific to a given user. Rent.com places both permanent and temporary cookies in your computer's hard drive. Rent.com's cookies do not contain any of your personally identifiable information. 

Our permanent cookies allow us to provide personalized features, such as automatically logging you into your personalized Start page. In order to use this feature, you must set your browser's preferences to allow permanent cookies. You will still be able to use the site if you block permanent cookies. 

We also use temporary cookies (a.k.a. "per-session cookies") to improve the functionality and usability of our site. These temporary cookies are permanently erased from your computer as soon as you log out of your Rent.com account or link to a different Web site from your parent browser window. In order to use Rent.com, you must set your browser's preferences to allow per-session cookies (most Web browsers automatically accept cookies). 

**Links to Other Sites**

Our site links to other Web sites that may collect personally identifiable information about you. Rent.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those linked Web sites. 

**Security Precautions**

Our site has stringent security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Whenever you change or access your account information, we offer the use of a secure server. Once your information is in our possession we adhere to strict security guidelines, protecting it against unauthorized access.
