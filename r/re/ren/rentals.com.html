Scope</h4><p>This Privacy Policy describes how we handle your personal information on the Rentals.com website (the “Website”), Rentals.com mobile applications (collectively, the “App”), and on other related sites, tools, applications, or services. By accepting the Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use when you submit a property contact form on Rentals.com, you expressly consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy, including its transfer to and storage on our servers in the United States or elsewhere in the world where RentPath has facilities.</p><h4>2. Collection</h4><p>When you submit a property contact form on the Website we will collect your name and email address.  Once you give us your email address or any other personal information, you are not anonymous to us. In most cases, the information we hold about you is collected through Rentals.com, but we may also collect information from private-label, co-branded and affiliate websites and/or from third parties with whom we have entered into an arrangement for such collection, or from their respective tools, applications or services (“Other Sites”).

(If we use your personal information to market to you, you will be able to opt-out of such communications; see below under Section 5. Communications and Communications Tools and Section 6. Cookies.)</li><li>connect you with third parties that provide products or services related to moving or relocating.</li><li>make payments to third parties through the Website or the App, should you choose to do so.</li><li>request your review of a property.</li><li>compare information for accuracy and verify it with third parties.</li><li>measure consumer interest in our products and services.</li><li>summarize your information (including personal information) that you provided to us or our affiliates.</li><li>help promote a safe service and detect and prevent error, fraud and other potentially prohibited or illegal activity.</li><li>enforce our agreements, terms, conditions, and policies, and send you notices and alerts.</li><li>provide services as otherwise described to you at the time of collection.</li></ul><h4>4. Disclosure</h4><p>We may provide some or all of your personal information, including email addresses, to: </p><ul><li>Law enforcement offices, third-party rights owners or others in the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our Terms of Use or Privacy Policy; respond to claims that an advertisement, posting or other content violates the rights of a third party; or protect the rights, property or personal safety of our users or the general public.</li><li>Other third parties whose services you agree to use (e.g., online rent payment services), or with regard to whom you have expressed interest or with whom you initiate communication through Property Contact Forms (See Section 5 Communications and Communications Tools). (The information we disclose in this way will be subject to those third parties’ privacy policies.)</li><li>Service providers under contract who help with our business operations (such as fraud investigations, bill collection, invoicing, telecommunication and call monitoring services, rewards programs, co-branded credit cards, etc.).</li><li>Another business entity should we plan to merge with, or sell substantially all our assets to that business entity.

Logs, recordings, and other information related to communication between you and third parties in connection with the services and/or other uses and purposes mentioned herein may be stored, maintained and/or divulged to those third parties by us on an individual basis or in the aggregate. Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy, we will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement, other government officials, or other third parties without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity.</p><h4>5. Communications and Communication Tools.</h4><p>Rentals.com communicates with users, and facilitates communications between users, in a variety of ways, including but not limited to:</p><h5>Property Contact Forms</h5><p>We make tools available that facilitate communications between Renters and Lessors by phone or email. When these tools are used, we may collect certain information related to the communication, like email addresses, contact logs, calling number, call duration, contents of the email communication, and (when notified during the call) call recordings. We may share this information with Lessors so they can manage their communications with Renters, and we will use this information to enforce our rights to collect fees payable by Lessors.</p><h5>Email preferences.</h5><p>We provide all users with the opportunity to opt out of receiving non-essential (promotional, marketing-related) communications from us. To remove your contact information from Rentals.com lists and newsletters, you can click on the “unsubscribe” link that is included at the bottom of any Rentals.com email you receive.</p><h4>6. Cookies</h4><p>We or our service providers may place cookies or web beacons on your computer when you visit portions of Rentals.com. We use permanent cookies to provide personalized features, such as automatically logging you into your personalized home page and to deliver customized services, content, and advertising. We use session cookies, which are deleted when you log out of Rentals.com or browse to a different website, to monitor and improve the functionality and usability of the Website. You can block our cookies by changing the settings on your browser (contact your ISP for help), but doing so may prevent us from delivering certain services to you.</p><p>We may use third-party advertising companies such as Cross Pixel Media, DoubleClick or Yahoo! to serve ads on our and our advertising partners’ behalf. These companies may employ cookies and web beacons to deliver advertising and measure its effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and web beacons is completely anonymous.

Third Parties</h4><p>Except as otherwise expressly included herein, this Privacy Policy addresses only the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to others, whether they are Renters and Lessors or other websites throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. Rentals.com does not control the privacy policies of third parties. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.</p><p>Rentals.com has links to other websites that may collect personal information about you. Rentals.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those linked websites.</p><h4>8. Security</h4><p>Your information (other than credit card or bank account information) is stored on our servers located in the United States. We treat data as an asset that must be protected and use many tools (encryption, passwords, physical security, etc.) to protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from Rentals.com. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.</p><h4>9. Minors</h4><p>The Website and the App are intended solely for use by persons 13 years of age or older. If you are under the age of 13, you may not use the Website, App or other services, or contribute any information to us.</p><h4>10.

To make such a request, please send an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@rentpath.com">privacy@rentpath.com</a>. </p><h4>11. General</h4><p>We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended terms on Rentals.com. We’ll provide you with notice of the changes on the Website. Amended terms take effect upon acceptance for new users and 10 days after they are posted on Rentals.com for all other users.</p><h4>12.
