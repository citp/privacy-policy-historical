Privacy Policy for Rent.com.au (Operations) Pty Ltd, ACN 091 233 680 and its related entities, 'rent.com.au'

Please Read Carefully

### Preface

This is the online Privacy Policy for rent.com.au (also referred to as 'we', 'our' and 'us' in this Privacy Policy) and it applies to all personal information collected by rent.com.au. This policy explains how and why we collect your personal information, how we use it, and what controls you have over our use of it. By using this site, you agree to the Privacy Policy of rent.com.au, which is set out below.

Certain services available through rent.com.au may be subject to additional privacy policies, for example RentCheck, RentBond, RentConnect, finance broking services and our Investor Centre. Some of these services are provided by third parties, so the additional policies may relate to those parties.

### Collection of information

Some information provided to us by clients, customers, contractors and other third parties, including but not limited to real estate agents, real estate industry professionals, trades and service providers, is personal information as it relates to identifiable individuals. Without these details we would not be able to carry on our business and provide our services to you.

In particular, personal information is collected from people in the following situations by rent.com.au:

  * If you contact rent.com.au, we may keep a record of that correspondence;
  * When you submit your email address to our web site mailing list; and
  * When you request any one of the services provided on the web site.



We collect both current and historical personal information which may include information about:

  * your name, contact details, date of birth, identification, payment details, organisation, interests, preferences, opinions and enquiry/complaint details;
  * your property details including location, price, features, description and rental status;
  * your use of our products and services and your other dealings with us, including records of any contact we have with you by telephone, email or online;
  * your tenancy database history, court records, missed rent payments and bankruptcy status; and
  * your linked social media accounts.



We collect personal information directly from you as well as from third parties including tenants, landlords, real estate agents, public sources, our related companies, your organisation, your representatives, information service providers, social media and the parties with whom we exchange information as described here. For example, we may collect information from:

  * the Equifax National Tenancy Database (NTD), government records, court documents, ASIC, and other public databases if you or someone else conducts a RentCheck about you; and
  * your account with a third party service (such as your social media profile) when you use that account to login or connect with us.



Where you provide us with personal information about someone else you must have their consent to provide their personal information to us based on this Privacy Policy.

At or before the time the personal information is collected by us we will take reasonable steps to ensure that you are made aware of who we are, the fact that you are able to gain access to the information held about you, the purpose of the collection, the type(s) of organisations to which we usually disclose the information collected about you, any laws requiring the collection of the information and the main consequences for you if all or part of the information is not collected.

### Use of information collected and disclosure of personal information to others

We use the information we collect from and about you to provide services and features to you, including: 

  * To measure and improve those Company Services and features; 
  * To improve your experience with both our online and off-line services and features by delivering content we believe you are likely to find relevant and interesting, including advertising and marketing messages;
  * To allow you to comment on content, and participate in games, competitions, or rewards programs;
  * To provide you with customer support and to respond to your enquiries. 



When you are not reasonably identifiable in relation to the information collected from or about you it is not personal information and we may use that information for any purpose or share it with third parties. We may also de-identify the information we collect about you so that we can use and disclose it without using or revealing any personal information about you.

We use the information we collect from and about you for these additional purposes:

_To provide our services._ We use the information we collect from and about you to provide our services to you, to fulfil administrative functions associated with these services (for example billing, credit, record management and account management), to enter into contracts with you or third parties and for marketing and client relationship purposes. Where your information is contained within an advertisement which rent.com.au publishes for you, we may also use your information for publication of that same advertisement on other sites or in other media, in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to the initial publication of the advertisement. We may also use your information to improve our services including through research and data analysis by us and our service providers. Where your personal information is contained in a user generated post on our site or in social media, we may publish your name and suburb to identify you as the author of the comment/correspondence if we choose to publish comment/correspondence in any media. We may use and disclose your personal information in other ways expressly disclosed at the point of collection. If you are a competition winner we may disclose your information to relevant regulatory authorities and publish your details in accordance with the competition terms.

_To allow service and content providers to assist us in providing and managing our services and features._ rent.com.au may make your information available to certain third party service and content providers, such as providers of data cloud services, website hosting service providers, debt collection services and direct marketing services, who help us manage or provide our services or provide us with related services. These third parties may be located in a range of different countries including the United Kingdom, United States of America and Singapore. rent.com.au generally requires these service and content providers to comply with relevant privacy laws and not to use personal information which we provide for any purpose other than the specific service they are providing to you and/or us.

_To allow social sharing functionality._ If you log in with or connect a social media service account with our services, we may share your user name, picture, tweets and likes, as well as your activities and comments with other rent.com.au service users and with your friends associated with your social media service. We may also share the same information with the social media service provider. By logging in with or connecting your rent.com.au services account with a social media service, you are authorising us to share information we collect from and about you with the social media service provider, other users and your friends and you understand that the social media service's use of the shared information will be governed by the social media service's privacy policy. If you do not want your personal information shared in this way, please do not connect your social media service account with your rent.com.au services account and do not participate in social sharing on rent.com.au services.

_In connection with co-branded and rebranded services and features._ We may offer co-branded and rebranded services or features, such as competitions or other promotions together with a third party ("Co-Branded and Rebranded Services"). These include RentCheck, RentBond, RentConnect and finance broking services. These Co-Branded and Rebranded Services may be hosted on rent.com.au services or on the third party's service. By virtue of these relationships, we may share the information you submit in connection with the Co-Branded or Rebranded Service with the third party. The third party's use of your information will be governed by the third party's privacy policy. We will advise you when this is occurring or obtain your express consent to share your personal information in these circumstances.

_To deliver relevant advertisements and content._ We and our advertisers may use the information we collect from and about you to deliver relevant ads and content to you when you use the rent.com.au services or another service. 

_To contact you._ rent.com.au may periodically send promotional materials or notifications which it believes might be of interest to you. Promotional materials may include invitations to participate in various activities (such as customer surveys) or special offers.

_To share with business partners._ Where you have expressly consented to this, we may share your information with business partners to permit them to send you marketing communications consistent with your choices.

_To protect the rights of rent.com.au and others._ There may be instances when we may disclose your information, including situations where we are authorised by law or we have a good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary in order to: 

  * Protect, enforce, or defend the legal rights, privacy, safety, or property of rent.com.au, our related companies or their employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements and our terms of use); 
  * Protect the safety, privacy, and security of users of the rent.com.au services or members of the public;
  * Protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; 
  * Comply with the law or legal process in any country; or 
  * Respond to requests from public and government authorities.



_To complete a merger or sale of assets._ If rent.com.au sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of its assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a material part of its business, we may transfer or disclose your information to the party or parties involved in the transaction as part of that transaction and as part of any due diligence processes which take place in contemplation of a potential transaction.
