<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Thank you for visiting a website owned by YapStone, Inc. (“we”, “us” and “our”). Your privacy is important to us. In order to better protect your privacy, we have developed this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”). The Privacy Policy explains our information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used at this website and our services. The Privacy Policy is based on these principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will disclose how we use the information we collect;</li>
<li>We will give you an opportunity to restrict our use of the information;</li>
<li>We will give you an opportunity to tell us not to give the information to others; and</li>
<li>We will give you an opportunity to correct the information in our records when it has been erroneously recorded.</li>
</ul>
<p>These principles and our policy apply whether we collect the information by paper, online or as part of you making a payment.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy (together with our website Terms of Service, agreements we may have entered into with you, disclosures made at the time we collected your information, and any other policies published on our websites) sets out the basis on which any personal or business data (“Personal Data”) we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us. Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your Personal Data and how we will treat it.</p>
<p>By visiting YapStone websites or otherwise submitting information to us, you consent that your data may be used in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<ol>
<li>Information We May Collect from You</li>
</ol>
<p>We may collect and process the following data about you:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">1. Information that you provide by filling in forms, applications, or provide to us to facilitate our customer due diligence procedures. This includes personally identifiable information (PII), information provided at the time of registering for our services, engaging in a transaction, establishing reoccurring transactions, or requesting further services. We may also ask you for information when you report a problem with our website.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">2. If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence regardless of the means.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">3. We may also ask you to complete surveys that we use for research purposes, although you do not have to respond to them.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">4. Details of transactions you carry out through our services and of the fulfillment of your transactions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">5. Details of your visits to our websites including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data, whether this is required for our own purposes or otherwise and the resources that you access.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">6. When you initiate a payment transaction, we also collect financial information such as credit card, debit card, or bank account details. We do so in accordance with the highest level of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS), as YapStone is a Level One provider.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">7. For verification purposes we reserve the right to request proof of identification in an offline format. This may include passport, driver’s license, proof of ownership, utility bill, business data, or other items we deem necessary to establish identity, residence, or place of business. Such proofs of identification may be stored electronically on our servers in order to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">8. Your IP address, computer or device information including device-specific parameters, and access times may be tracked. We do this to prevent fraud, establish your identity, and provide promotional information which may be of interest to you.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">9. Data necessary to detect and prevent fraud may be collected and compiled; we will either do this directly or in conjunction with a third-party who use this data to detect and protect against fraud (“third-party experts”). These third-party experts are subject to privacy and confidentiality obligations.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">&nbsp;10. Competitions, promotions, or giveaways may be made available on our websites or through third parties from time to time. You do not have to participate in these. However, if choose to you may be asked to disclose some personal information. At the time of entering the promotion, we will disclose in its specific Terms and Conditions how your personal information will be used. Please do not participate in any promotion if you do not agree to such usage.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>IP Addresses, Cookies, Tags, Online Tracking, and Click-through URLs</li>
</ol>
<p>We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type. Used for system administration, to perform fraud and risk checks, and to report aggregate information to our partners, this is statistical data about our users’ browsing actions and patterns, and may include IP or device information, this data does not identify any individual. We will not sell or rent the information collected to third parties for their marketing purposes. &nbsp;We may however share the information with partners to provide ads related to YapStone’s services after you have visited one of our websites.</p>
<p>For the same reasons, we may obtain information about your general Internet usage by using cookies. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer’s hard drive. A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser. They help us to improve our website and to deliver a better and more personalized service. They enable us:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">1. To estimate our audience size and usage pattern.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">2. To store information about your preferences, and to allow us to customize our website according to your individual interests.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">3. To speed up the delivery of pages you commonly use.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">4. To recognize you when you return to our website.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">5. To verify your identity.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">6. To prevent fraud.</p>
<p>We may use both “<em>session</em>” cookies and “<em>persistent</em>” cookies on our website. Session cookies will be deleted from your computer when you close your browser. Persistent cookies will remain stored on your computer until deleted, or until they reach a specified expiry date. You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our website. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you log on to our website.</p>
<p>We may use third-party cookies to help us improve our website design, user experience and to provide you with information about YapStone through trusted remarking services. &nbsp;Please note that our partners may also use cookies, over which we have no control. Please also note that third-parties may be able to uniquely identify your device or browser even if you have disabled cookies.</p>
<p>We may occasionally use a “<strong>click-through URL</strong>”. When you click one of these URLs, you pass through our web server before arriving at your final destination. We track click-throughs to help us improve the user experience, determine your interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications.</p>
<p>Some web browsers permit you to set Do Not Track (DNT) signals which would prevent websites from tracking your behavior online. The applicable standards are still being developed and as a result, we cannot respond to the DNT signal. This means our service providers are able to compile analytics about your movements on our website and remarket YapStone services to you.</p>
<p>Please be aware that YapStone is not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our website to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Where We Store Your Personal Data</li>
</ol>
<p>The data that we collect from you will be processed and stored in the United States. By submitting your personal data, you agree to the transfer, storing, or processing in the United States.

All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password that enables you to access certain parts of our service or engage with our customer service team, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential and adequately complex. We ask you not to share a password with anyone and change your password every 90 days.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our website; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.</p>

<ol start="6">
<li>Remarketing of YapStone’s Services</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">1. YapStone may partner with third parties to provide you with promotions and advertisements of YapStone’s services on YapStone’s behalf.&nbsp; This service is called “remarketing”.&nbsp; The service will allow third parties to display YapStone ads or promotions to you if you have previously visited one of YapStone’s websites based upon the cookies placed on your computer.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">2. You can prevent remarketing by deleting your cookies or blocking cookies, though certain websites operate more effectively with cookies enabled.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">3. There are some general rules around how remarketing works; here they are:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;">i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will not use or associate personally identifiable information with remarketing lists, cookies, data feeds, or other anonymous identifiers.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;">ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will not use or associate targeting information, such as location, with any personally identifiable information collected from an ad or its landing page.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;">iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will not share any personally identifiable information with any partner ad network through our remarketing tag or any ad-associated product data feeds.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;">iv.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do not send precise location information without obtaining your consent.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;">v.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We abide by Google’s policies for identified <a href="https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/143465?hl=en&amp;rd=1">Sensitive Categories</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;">vi.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will not modify or obscure any notices an ad network may display to users about the remarketing lists they’re on, along with the corresponding domain name.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Your Rights</li>
</ol>
<p>Our websites may contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers, and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Changes to the Privacy Policy</li>
</ol>
<p>Any changes we may make to the Privacy Policy in the future will be posted on this page and, where appropriate, notified to you by email one month prior to the change becoming effective. If we are going to use your personal information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify you via email, if one was provided to us. You will have a choice whether or not to allow us to use your information in this new manner.If you do not contact us stating your refusal to accept the changes to the Privacy Policy within the one month notice period, you will be deemed to have accepted the changes. If you refused to accept the changes, we may be required to shut down or terminate your ability to use the Services. However, if your account with YapStone has been suspended or closed then you will not be contacted and your information will not be used in this new manner.</p>
