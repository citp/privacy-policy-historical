# Privacy Policy - Renaissance Faire

##### Renaissance Entertainment Productions; the producers of the Renaissance Pleasure Faire, the Bristol Renaissance Faire, the New York Renaissance Faire and the Forest of Fear respect your right to privacy. Here’s what you may expect by utilizing our website, signing up for our newsletters, and purchasing tickets online:

## We do not share your information.

##### Renaissance Entertainment Productions utilizes Constant Contact to send emails to users who provide their email addresses with express consent. This information is only used while sending emails about Renaissance Entertainment Productions and is not shared by Renaissance Entertainment Productions with any further third parties. You can find Constant Contact’s privacy policy here: <https://www.endurance.com/privacy/privacy>

##### Renaissance Entertainment Productions utilizes ShowClix to process online ticket sales. Information collected during the order process is only used by ShowClix and Renaissance Entertainment Productions to provide the services you request and is not shared by Renaissance Entertainment Productions with any further third parties. Information is retained by Renaissance Entertainment Productions for no longer than seven years after you terminate services unless we are otherwise required by law or regulation to retain your personal information for longer. You can find ShowClix’s privacy policy here: <https://www.showclix.com/privacy-policy>

## The submission of your information is secure.

##### We use a secured server with an encrypted Secured Socket Layer (SSL) for the transmissions of your information. This protects you from those who would pirate your information.

## You are only signed up for the lists you choose.

##### If you wish to receive information for more of our events, you must subscribe to each one individually. You will only be contacted regarding the event(s) you’ve subscribed to.

## You are never forced to register for our mailings.

##### The only time you are required to give us your email address is during our online ordering process. This is so we may contact you about your order if necessary. We do not use these email addresses for our mailing list. To subscribe, you must use the subscription process.

## We do not send large volumes of mail.

##### We only send to postal addresses once or twice a year. Email newsletters can be as frequent as once a week while an event is in progress or if a deadline for a special offer is approaching. Otherwise, newsletters are sent every 1-2 months as appropriate to keep you informed of what is happening.

## You may unsubscribe at any time.

##### At the time of subscription, you will receive an email describing the unsubscribe process. Additionally, at the bottom of each email is a link to unsubscribe. You may also at any time simply reply to an email and ask to be removed. If you wish to re-subscribe, you are free to do so.

## We utilize a double opt-in method of subscription.

##### Once you have requested a subscription, our system will automatically send a confirmation email to the email address provided. This email will contain a URL that you will need to click on to confirm your subscription. You will then get a second email with the URL to unsubscribe.

### IP Addresses and Click-Stream Data

##### As is the case with many websites, our servers automatically collect your IP address when you visit our Site, and we may associate that with your domain name or that of your Internet access provider. We may also capture certain “clickstream data” pertaining to your Site usage. Clickstream data includes, for example, information about your computer or device, web browser and operating system and their settings, the referring page that linked you to the Site, the pages, content or ads you see or click on during your visit and when and for how long you do so, items you download, the next website you visit when you leave the Site, and any search terms you have entered on the Site or a referral site.
