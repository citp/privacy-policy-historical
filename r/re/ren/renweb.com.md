The primary goal of WilComp in collecting personal information from our customers is to assist our customers in managing the information they provide utilizing our products and services.

We have and will always insist that any such information that needs to be disclosed for any business purpose be considered confidential and not used for any purpose other than the specific business need. That well-understood business policy of confidentiality will be reinforced as needed by contractual agreements with any service provider having access to your data.
