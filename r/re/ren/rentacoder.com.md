Privacy Statement

_**For those who view Rent A Coder**_ Internet user privacy and confidentiality is of the utmost importance to Rent A Coder and its owning company, [Exhedra Solutions, Inc](http://www.exhedra.com/). Its reputation and integrity is directly related to how it serves its web customers. 

As a result,  Rent A Coder openly volunteers its practices of collecting information, its targeting capabilities, and its use of cookies. If you have any questions pertaining to this privacy policy and its contents, please direct your correspondence to [privacy@exhedra.com](mailto:privacy@exhedra.com).

**Credit Card Information, Pay Pal Account Information, Bank Account Information, Real Name, Phone#, Address Information, Social Security/EIN information and other personal information:**  
  
The above information is gathered from either buyer or seller to facilitate payment into or from escrow accounts.  All of this information is used for internal purposes and is not sold to any external companies.

     Social Security/EIN information is required to comply with IRS filing requirements.  We will not issue payments to U.S. citizens over the IRS mandated maximums without this information.  City, state and country information are posted publicly on the web site to allow buyer and sellers in similar locations and time-zones to more easily locate each other. If you feel uncomfortable having your name associated with a city, state and country, we recommend that you make use of the anonymous 'Screen Name' feature to protect your identity.

Other than the address information specified above, none of this information is shared with the other party at any time in the bid request process by Exhedra (with the exception of email address...as follows). Once a buyer accepts a bid from a coder, email address information is released to facilitate the transaction between both parties. At that point, both sides may work out which additional pieces of information (if any) they would like to exchange. 

Additionally...no information will be divulged or sold to any 3rd parties without your permission. If a user signs up for an opt-in email list, they will always be given the opportunity to opt out of it at any time, using a link at the bottom of the email.

**Closing accounts**

  
At the request of any user, we will close out that user's account, disabling all future use of the account. However, we cannot delete information as we may be legally called upon by a 3rd party to report such information.

Exhedra uses the best of its ability, utilizing state of the art techniques to protect all privacy related data from external and unauthorized party access. However no security sytem is 100% full-proof, so should sensitive data be compromised, Exhedra will alert the affected parties immediately via email addresses as registered on the site. Due to the nature of security, Exhedra will not be held liable for any such security compromise, or any resulting loss or action resulting from such a compromise.
