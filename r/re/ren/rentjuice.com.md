_Last Updated: August 4, 2011_

This Privacy Policy describes how RentJuice Corporation ("We," "Us," or "Our") collects, uses and discloses personal information when you use the Web site located at www.rentjuice.com or any of our widgets or applications (collectively, the "Site").

This Privacy Policy applies to personal information collected through the Site.

Personal information does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Site or about a group or category of services or users, from which individual identities or other personal information has been removed. This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information. If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or our privacy practices, please email us at [privacy@rentjuice.com](mailto:privacy@rentjuice.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy).

Once we request a credit report from our vendors, we promptly remove your social security number from our database.

Personal information submitted to the Site or otherwise collected by us will become part of our normal business records and may be transferred to another company that has acquired our stock or assets, for example, as a result of a sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or liquidation. If such a transfer occurs, the acquiring company’s use of your personal information will still be subject to this Privacy Policy, and the privacy preferences you have expressed to us.

When personal information is shared with Service Providers, such Service Providers are prohibited from using such information for anything other than providing the specific services to us for which such information was provided. However, we are not responsible for the actions of Service Providers or other third parties, nor are we responsible for any additional information you provide directly to any third parties, and we encourage you to become familiar with their privacy practices before disclosing information directly to any such parties.

You understand that when you join RentJuice, you will be added to the RentJuice Directory, which is available to all users and which may be made publicly available. Such directory information may include certain personal information you provide to us, such as your name, email and other contact information, unless you opt out of including such information in your directory listing by editing your Company Profile settings within the [Edit Directory Profile](http://app.rentjuice.com/account/settings/company) tab on the Site.

We recommend you be cautious about giving out personal information to others or sharing personal information through the Site.

Nothing herein restricts the sharing of aggregated or anonymized information, which may be shared with third parties without your consent.

## WHAT CHOICES DO YOU HAVE REGARDING THE USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

If you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional emails, such as emails about your accounts or our ongoing business relations.

You may also be given the opportunity to opt-in to our sharing your personal information with select companies that may make available to you products and services that we believe may be of interest to you. However, we will not share any of your personal information with such companies unless you have opted-in or as otherwise disclosed in this Policy.TRANSFER OF DATA ABROAD 

If you are visiting the Site from a country other than the country in which our Web servers are located (currently United States of America) the various communications will necessarily result in the transfer of information across international boundaries. By visiting the Site and communicating electronically with us, you consent to the processing and transfer of your data as set out in this Privacy Policy and you acknowledge that we may store and process personal information in the United States and other countries.

## SECURITY

No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. However, we have endeavored to put into place reasonable security measures in an effort to protect personal information while it is under our control.

For example, when you log in, provide credit card numbers, complete credit reports, send information to us during the registration process or access your account information, we use a secure server with Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") encryption software that makes unauthorized access more difficult. In addition, your account information is accessible online only through the use of a password. Please be aware, however, that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. To protect the confidentiality of personal information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You are responsible for all uses of the Site by any person using your password. Please advise us immediately if you believe your password has been misused. If you have any questions about our security practices, feel free to email us at [privacy@rentjuice.com](mailto:privacy@rentjuice.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy).

These links are provided for your reference and convenience only and do not imply any endorsement of the activities of these third party Web sites nor any association with their operators.
