    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

		<p>PURPOSE OF POLICY. (Updated 2/5/2014) rent-to-own.club ("us," "we," or "Company") is committed to respecting the privacy rights of its customers, visitors, and other users of the Company Website (the "Site") pursuant to the terms contained herein. We created this Rent-to-Own.club Privacy Policy (this "Policy") to give you notice of how your private information will be used as a result of submitting it to our Company. This Policy is only applicable to the Site, and not to any other websites that you may be able to access from the Site, each of which may have data collection and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Policy.<br><br>
		
		NOTICE CONCERNING CHILDREN. We are a general audience site, and do not direct any of our content specifically at children under 13 years of age. We understand and are committed to respecting the sensitive nature of children’s privacy online. If we learn or have reason to suspect that a Site user is under age 13, we will promptly delete any personal information in that user’s account.<br><br>
		
		INFORMATION COLLECTION PRACTICES<br><br>
		
		WHAT BASIC INFORMATION DOES THE COMPANY COLLECT? We collect certain personal information about our users that enables us and/or our affiliates and partners to identify or contact users, and includes, among other things, the user’s full name, address, telephone number and e-mail address, as well as other information we maintain about a person in identifiable form.<br><br>
		
		WHAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION DOES COMPANY COLLECT?<br><br>
		
		(a) AUTOMATIC COLLECTION. Our servers automatically recognize visitors’ domain names and IP addresses (the number assigned to computers on the Internet). No personal information about you is revealed in this process. The Site may also gather anonymous "traffic data" that does not personally identify you, but that may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer.<br><br>
		
		(b) COOKIES. From time to time, we may use the standard 'cookies' feature of major browser applications that allows us to store a small piece of data on your computer about your visit to our Web site. We do not set any personally identifiable information in cookies, nor do we employ any data capture mechanisms on our website other than cookies. Cookies help us learn which areas of our site are useful, which areas need improvement, and to deliver personalized advertisements on ours and other websites. The Help feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Web site of its manufacturer.  However, if you choose to disable this function, your experience at our Web site may be diminished and some features may not work as they were intended.<br><br>
