				  </p>
				  <p>Please
				  Read Carefully
				  
				  </p>
				  <p><b>Preface</b>
				  
				  </p>
				  <p>This
				  is the online Privacy Policy for
				  Rent.com.au (also referred to as 'we',
				  'our' and 'us' in this Privacy
				  Policy) and it applies to all personal
				  information collected by Rent.com.au. This
				  policy explains how and why we collect
				  your personal information, how we use it,
				  and what controls you have over our use of
				  it. By using this site, you agree to the
				  online Privacy Policy of Rent.com.au,
				  which is set out below.&nbsp;
				  
				  
				  </p>
				  <p><b>Collection
				  of information
				  </b>
				  </p>
				  <p>Some
				  information provided to us by clients,
				  customers, contractors and other third
				  parties, including but not limited to real
				  estate agents, real estate industry
				  professionals, trades and service
				  providers, might be considered private or
				  personal. Without these details we would
				  not be able to carry on our business and
				  provide our services to you. We will only
				  collect such personal information if it is
				  necessary for one of our functions or
				  activities.
				  
				  </p>
				  <p>In
				  particular, personal information is
				  collected from people in the following
				  situations by Rent.com.au: 
				  
				  </p>
				  <p>-
				  If you contact Rent.com.au, we may
				  keep a record of that correspondence. 
				  
				  </p>
				  <p>-
				  When you submit your e-mail address
				  to our web site mailing list
				  
				  </p>
				  <p>-
				  When you request any one of the
				  services provided on the web site
				  
				  </p>
				  <p>At
				  or before the time the personal
				  information is collected by us we will
				  take reasonable steps to ensure that you
				  are made aware of who we are, the fact
				  that you are able to gain access to the
				  information held about you, the purpose of
				  the collection, the type(s) of
				  organisations to which we usually disclose
				  the information collected about you, any
				  laws requiring the collection of the
				  information and the main consequences for
				  you if all or part of the information is
				  not collected.
				  
				  </p>
				  <p><b>Use
				  of information collected and disclosure of
				  personal information to others
				  
				  </b></p>
				  <p>We
				  may use or disclose personal information
				  held about an individual for the primary
				  purpose for which it is collected (eg.
				  provision of our services, including
				  administration of our services,
				  notification to you about changes to our
				  services, record-keeping following
				  termination of our services to you and
				  technical maintenance). We may also use
				  such information for a purpose related to
				  the primary purpose of collection and
				  where it would reasonably be expected by
				  you that we would use the information in
				  such a way. This information is only
				  disclosed to persons outside our business
				  in the circumstances set out in this
				  policy or as otherwise notified to you at
				  the time of collection of the information.
				  
				  </p>
				  <p>In
				  addition we are permitted to use or
				  disclose personal information held about
				  you: 
				  
				  </p>
				  <p>-
				  Where you have consented to the use
				  or disclosure; 
				  
				  </p>
				  <p>-
				  Where we reasonably believe that
				  the use or disclosure is necessary to
				  lessen or prevent a serious, immediate
				  threat to someone's health or safety or
				  the public's health or safety; 
				  
				  </p>
				  <p>-
				  Where we reasonably suspect that
				  unlawful activity has been, is being or
				  may be engaged in and the use or
				  disclosure is a necessary part of our
				  investigation or in reporting the matter
				  to the relevant authorities; 
				  
				  </p>
				  <p>-
				  Where such use or disclosure is
				  required under or authorised by law (for
				  example, to comply with a subpoena, a
				  warrant or other order of a court or legal
				  process); 
				  
				  </p>
				  <p>-
				  Where we reasonably believe that
				  the use or disclosure is reasonably
				  necessary for prevention, investigation,
				  prosecution and punishment of crimes or
				  wrongdoings or the preparation for,
				  conduct of, proceedings before any court
				  or tribunal or the implementation of the
				  orders of a court or tribunal by or on
				  behalf of an enforcement body.</p>

				  retains the information you provide to us
				  including your contact and credit card
				  details to enable us to verify
				  transactions and customer details and to
				  retain adequate records for legal and
				  accounting purposes. 
				  
				  </p>
				  <p><b>Your
				  Password</b> 
				  
				  </p>
				  <p>You
				  are solely responsible for keeping your
				  passwords and/or account information
				  secret. You should be careful and

				  is committed to maintaining accurate,
				  timely, relevant and appropriate
				  information about our customers, clients
				  and web-site users.
				  
				  </p>
				  <p>So
				  long as your request for your personal
				  information is in accordance with the
				  National Privacy Principles, then we will
				  give you access to that information. 
				  
				  </p>
				  <p>Inaccurate
				  information will be corrected upon
				  receiving advice to this effect from you.
				  To ensure confidentiality, details of your
				  personal information will be passed on to
				  you only if we are satisfied that the
				  information relates to you.
				  
				  </p>
				  <p>If
				  we refuse to provide you with access or
				  correct the personal information held
				  about you by us, then we will provide
				  reasons for such refusal.
				  
				  </p>
				  <p><b>Complaints
				  </b>
