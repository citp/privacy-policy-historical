# Renault Forums :: Independent Renault forum Our rules

## If you are a business wishing to promote your products or services, [please contact us for permission](http://www.renaultforums.co.uk/sendmessage.php) before posting on the forums or contacting members. Thank you.

###  Rules 

Membership with RenaultForums is currently free. However, we still insist that our members abide by the rules of the forum. Please carefully read these statements, as ignorance of the rules is no defence if you break them. You can find a link to these rules in the left hand menu should you wish to refer to them after your registration is complete

You should consider before registering with RenaultForums that this is an independent community and has absolutely no affiliation with Renault whatsoever

#### 1\. Content

Although the administrators of this web site will attempt to remove as much questionable material as possible, it is simply impossible for us to read every message. All messages express the views of the member who wrote them, and neither the owner of RenaultForums, nor Jelsoft Enterprises Ltd. (the developers of vBulletin) will be held responsible for the content of any message

RenaultForums will review any questionable content when this is brought to our attention. You can do this very easily by clicking this icon:

To help us to avoid the need to "police" the forums, please do not post any messages that are:

a) Obscene or pornographic  
b) Hateful  
c) Threatening  
d) Unlawful (including the posting of software cracks and/or serial numbers)

You should also remember that RenaultForums does not under any circumstances allow the reproduction of copyrighted material. This includes, but is not restricted to:

a) PDF documents such as Dialogys files  
b) Screen prints from commercial software  
c) Information from copyrighted pages on other web sites  
d) Pirated software  
e) Scans of printed documents  
f) etc. etc.

Please do not circulate copyrighted material anywhere on RenaultForums. This includes public areas of the forum and private messages (PMs)

We can not stress highly enough how important it is that this rule is not broken

Radio, infotainment systems and immobilisers have security codes to limit the risk of theft, therefore, whilst it is perfectly reasonable to ask how to input the code, it is not reasonable to ask or provide details of where to obtain that code - apart from a Renault dealership, or any paperwork they have provided. This is so the forum doesn't compromise the integrity of this security feature.

We will also not allow the sale of, or discussions about, devices & techniques aimed at bypassing immobilisers or other security mechanisms

In reference to point c) above it is acceptable to quote material from other web sites but please acknowledge the source of the information and provide a link to the original where you think that this is appropriate

The owners of RenaultForums reserve the right to remove, edit, move or close any thread for any reason. We also reserve the right to maintain the content of your messages should you choose to cancel your account. This allows us to maintain the integrity of the threads

#### 2\. Censorship

This forum is aimed at a mature audience. We therefore have a relaxed censorship policy. A swear-filter is in place but it is possible that you will encounter swearing, rude jokes and other adult material

In order to help you to avoid adult content, certain forums such as the "General Chat" and "Jokes and Funny Stuff" sections have a warning

If you do wish to post adult material please choose the following symbol when creating your thread:

You might also consider adding the widely recognised NSFW (Not Safe for Work) tag to your thread title

We have a strict policy regarding naming and shaming of any company or service provider etc. You are encouraged to report on good service but you may find your posts edited or removed if they contain specific allegations against named individuals or businesses. Other sites, such as [http://www.BView.co.uk](http://www.bview.co.uk/), have a much more relaxed approach to naming & shaming. If you wish to vent your spleen, we would prefer it if you would use an alternative site

#### 3\. Consequential loss

RenaultForums is not responsible for any advice given by our members, either discussed or implied. Answers to questions are offered as information only and no responsibility is accepted by RenaultForums or the site administrators and moderators for any conceivable consequence might be related to any advice given

Further more, our members offer their opinions in order to try to assist other members. It is essential that you take the necessary steps to confirm that the opinion is correct

#### 4\. Advertising

Renaultforums puts the best interest of its members first, and with that in mind, only officially sanctioned advertising will be permitted. By all means, recommend a business you have personally used, but touting a business or website you are connected with (without prior permission), will be considered spamming, and dealt with the same method - a permanent ban.

#### 5\. The law

The issue of ownership of the content of a web site is a grey area in UK law. For this reason it is essential that you read rules 1 to 3 carefully

The owners of RenaultForums will not enter into any debate regarding freedom of speech, censorship or any aspect of the law. The posts made by our members could be considered the opinion of the site owners and as such we prefer to be cautious about such matters

NB. Any threat of legal action will result in the site closing so it is in our member’s best interests to work towards avoiding any such eventuality

#### 6\. Posting

a) Flaming

Flaming is a natural community response to stupid remarks, harassment, deception, insults etc. This forum is aimed at an adult audience and we much prefer that you fight your own battles

With this in mind do not be surprised if reports of flaming are ignored. However, if we consider flaming to be over the top we will take action

b) Dishonesty

We will not tolerate dishonesty. Nobody likes to deal with deception and lying in the real world and the same can be said of online communities. For this reason the following is unacceptable:

i) Registration under multiple accounts  
ii) Lying  
iii) Editing posts to make it appear that you said something different to support an argument

c) Trolling and spamming

Trolling and spamming will not be tolerated and you should expect your threads to be removed if it is clear that they have been created for the purpose of stirring up trouble or, in the case of spamming, posted with no obvious intent

d) Controversy

We do not expect our members to agree on everything. You should not, therefore, expect the administrators or moderators to step in just because someone’s opinion is unpopular

e) Rudeness

It is more than possible that in an argument someone will be rude to you. This is an inevitable fact of life – get over it

However, we will not tolerate vendettas and will deal with anyone waging an online war with another member simply because they do not like them or agree with them

Persistent humiliation of another member, evidence of vendettas and unnecessary hostility will be dealt with on a case by case basis

#### 7\. Profiles

We reserve the right to edit your username, avatar, custom title and signature etc. should we consider that they are inappropriate

If you have posted a message on RenaultForums, we are unable to delete your account. This is to ensure that the stream of any conversations that you have started or participated in is not lost

#### 8\. Enforcement

a) If you feel that a member’s behaviour is not appropriate please click the following icon next to the post in question:

This will bring the post to the attention of the administration team

b) Moderators have been chosen for a reason. Do not tell them how to do their job

c) Administrators and moderators have a right to their opinion. Complaints about administration team members based on a difference of opinion will be treated with contempt. However, administration team members are not immune from flaming BUT this only extends to any expression of their opinion in a thread, and not in relation to their job as an administration or moderator

d) Any accusations of abuse of power by the administration staff will be ignored. Decisions are generally made collectively and you should therefore presume that the entire administration staff is in agreement

e) We don’t operate on precedence. We will decide what disciplinary action is required on a case by case basis

f) Under no circumstances should you change or remove an edit made by an administrator or moderator. The edit is there as an example to others and if we find that you have changed it additional punishment will be forthcoming

g) Failure to comply with the instruction or wishes of a member of the admin staff will result in suitable disciplinary measures being taken against you

#### 9\. The rules

The rules should be used to determine what behaviour is acceptable. Omissions and errors in the rules should not be used as an excuse to justify inappropriate behaviour or as a means to justify your rights or settle an argument

The rules are subject to change at any time. If you point out an omission in the rules in an attempt to justify yourself, the rules will be amended and disciplinary action will be taken regardless of the omission

#### 10\. To close

a) Your participation in the RenaultForums community is appreciated. However, you being here in the first place is a privilege, not a right

b) The rules have been agreed upon by all members of the administration team

Rules last revised 14th January 2009 (marked in red)

### **Usage guidelines**

In addition to our Rules you may wish to consider the following guidelines:

#### 1\. Posting

Please read a few posts and familiarise yourself with how the forum works. Make sure your thread includes a clear description in the title and if you require technical help remember to provide as much information as possible. In order that the information is presented to our members in every thread you create or reply to, you can add information about the car that you drive in the user control panel

#### 2\. Off topic posting

Not only is RenaultForums a rich resource of Renault and automotive content, it’s a thriving community of like-minded people. You will therefore find posts on all sorts of subjects including off-topic posting. All we ask is that you use the correct forum for your posts if they are not automotive. Off-topic posting should be restricted to the "Miscellaneous" forum

#### 3\. Repetition

You may find that your question has already been answered. Before asking your question make sure that you use the forums search facility. You should also look at the FAQ section and check for any sticky posts at the top of the forum

#### 4\. Keep it private!

You should not add personal information to the forum. This includes, but is not restricted to:

a) Your email address

b) Address

c) Phone number

We do ask you for your email address during the registration process, but it is kept private

#### 5\. Duplication

Please do not post the same question in different forums on the site. This is a huge problem and is very frustrating for people who may be trying to help you. Persistent duplication of posts may be considered to be spamming and will be dealt with accordingly

#### 6\. Manners

This may be a virtual community, but you are expected to remember your manners. When asking for help, a please and thank you would not go amiss

Usage guidelines last revised 8th of June 2007
