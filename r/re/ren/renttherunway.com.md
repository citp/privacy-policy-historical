# Privacy - Rent Women's Dresses & Accessories | Rent The Runway

  


#### Overview

  


Rent the Runway, Inc. knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy for the www.renttherunway.com web site (the “Website”). 

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should contact us at legalinfo@renttherunway.com, (212) 462-2342, 163 Varick Street, 4th Floor, New York, NY 10013. This privacy policy covers only information that is collected by and through the Website and does not cover information that may be collected through software downloaded from the site or other means.

#### Notice of Information We Collect And How We Use It

  


Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our service to make your experience safer and easier. We only collect personal information about you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose. 

In general, you can browse the Website without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give us your personal information, you are no longer anonymous to us. 

#### Information We Collect About Anonymous Visitors

We automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on the Website. We use this information to do internal research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and our community.

##### Log Files

Like many web sites, we automatically gather certain information about our Website traffic and store it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, and aggregate it with other pieces of information to analyze trends, to administer and improve the Website, to track users’ movements around the Website and to make inventory purchasing decisions that will best serve our customer base. Pages of the Website may also use devices that permit us to count users who have visited those pages and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity).

We typically do not link this automatically collected data to personally identifiable information. When IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information it is to offer customers the best user experience possible. We use a third-party tracking service that uses log files and cookies, see below, to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to the Website in the aggregate. This service captures usage and volume statistics. 

##### Cookies

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. As noted above, we do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by the Website only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

We use both session ID and persistent cookies.

A session cookie expires when you close your browser. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Website. 

A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.

If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our Website, such as contests or surveys, will be limited.

##### Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)

We employ a software technology called clear gifs, also referred to as web beacons or web bugs, that help manage content on the Website by tracking what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. 

We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails recipients have opened. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see “Choice and Opt-out.”

  


#### Third Party Advertisers

Third party advertising companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this Website and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. These third party cookies do not collect personally identifiable information. For more information about cookies, web beacons and how to opt out of third party data collection, please see the “Cookies” “Clear GIFs” and “Choice/Opt-out sections of this policy.
