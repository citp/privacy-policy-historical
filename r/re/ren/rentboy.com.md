Janet Reno, in her official capacity as Attorney General of the United States (139 F.3d 804, 10th Circuit, 1998), which held that entities which merely distribute content, and have no role in procuring or producing content, are not primary or secondary producers (as such terms are defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2257 and 28 C.F.R. § 75) and, accordingly, are exempt from record keeping requirements.  The content supplied on this site is posted voluntarily by the users of this site.  ERS, therefore, does not participate in the production of the photographs disseminated on this site.  Nonetheless information is herein provided as to where such records are located.
