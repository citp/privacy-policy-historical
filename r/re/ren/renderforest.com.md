### The Personal Information We Collect

We collect different types of personal information about the visitors and users of our website.

You can either anonymously browse our website, become a signed-up user or a subscriber to one of the Renderforest subscription plans. When you choose to sign up or become a subscriber, we will ask you to provide us with certain personal information so that we can create your account and make it possible for you to use Renderforest services. The required information will include your name and email address. You must provide this information in order to obtain an account and Renderforest agrees not to distribute this information to a third party in ways other than described in our Privacy Policy.

When purchasing a subscription you will be required to provide additional information on your payment and billing details so that we can process the transaction. Such third party processors who use your personal information are governed by their respective privacy policies which may or may not contain privacy protections in this privacy policy.

We also collect data generated when you log in to our website; including, your IP address, the type of device you use to log in to our website, your browser type, and operating system.

At Renderforest you are given an opportunity to sign up via Google or Facebook account. If you choose to sign up through one of these social media accounts we may also receive personal information the provider shares with us. In order to gain full understanding to what kind of information the social media platforms share with us, please refer to the provider’s privacy policy. ([Google Privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy), [Facebook Privacy](https://www.facebook.com/policy))

The personal information collected by Renderforest may be used to inform you about your purchase or if you want to purchase a certain product. If you have given your consent to send you email newsletters, we may also use this information to inform you about specific services that you may be interested in.

The video projects you create and the media files you upload from your device are saved on your personal media library. Renderforest may permanently delete your personal files after 60 days from your last activity, if you have not made any purchase.

For certain video templates, Renderforest enabled a new feature based on machine learning algorithms and AI principles, which allows Renderforest editor to generate animated stories from video scripts. By using the information from previously created animated videos, the automated system creates a new animation based on a video script. Collecting and processing such kind of anonymous information has no purpose other than to enhance the user experience within the website.

### The Personal Information You Make Public

Your profile and edited videos will be available only to you as a sole user. The videos you created with Renderforest will be available on My Videos page and are marked _unlisted_ by default. That means only people with the link can see your videos. You can make them private if you do not wish anybody else but yourself to have access to them or you can make them available for other Renderforest users to see or share. In this case, we do not accept responsibility for the way they will use that data.

Also, Renderforest provides its users the opportunity to interact and post content through various social media sites. Your interactions with such websites are publicly viewable outside of the website domain. Each social media site has its own privacy policy which may be more or less protected than our policy. If you do not wish for this information to be disclosed, then you should not use these online tools.

Please, think carefully before giving your information to anyone else or making it publicly available.
