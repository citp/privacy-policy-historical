**IP ADDRESSES, COOKIES AND CLICK-THROUGH URLS**

We may collect technical information about your computer, including for example, where available, your IP address, operating system, and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our Partners. This is aggregate statistical data about our users’ browsing actions and patterns.

For the same reasons, we may obtain information about your general Internet usage by using a cookie. A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer’s hard drive. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser. Cookies help us to improve our Website and to deliver a better and more personalised service. Cookies enable us:

  * To estimate our audience size and usage pattern;
  * To store information about your preferences, and to allow us to customise our website according to your individual interests;
  * To prevent fraud;
  * To speed up the delivery of pages you commonly use; and
  * To recognise you when you return to one of our Websites.



We may use both “ _session_ ” cookies and “ _persistent_ ” cookies on our website. Session cookies will be deleted from your computer when you close your browser. Persistent cookies will remain stored on your computer until deleted, or until they reach a specified expiry date. You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our website. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you log on to our website. Disabling a cookie or category of cookies does not delete the cookie from your browser; you will need to do this yourself from within your browser.  If you have disabled one or more cookies, we may still use information collected from cookies before your disabled preference was set. We stop, however, using subsequent disabled cookies to collect any further information.

We may use third-party cookies to help us improve our website design, user experience and to provide you with information about YapStone through trusted remarketing services.  We may allow selected third parties to place cookies through the Site to provide us with better insights into the use of the Site or user demographics or to provide relevant advertising to you.  These third parties may collect information about a consumer’s online activities over time and across different websites when he or she uses our website. Please note that our Partners may also use cookies, over which we have no control but which will be activated if you click through to our Partners’ websites. Please also note that third-parties may be able to uniquely identify your device or browser even if you have disabled cookies.

We may occasionally use a “ **click-through URL** ”. When you click one of these URLs, you pass through our web server before arriving at your final destination. We track click-throughs to help us improve the user experience, determine your interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications.

You can learn more about cookies at the following third-party websites:

  * AllAboutCookies: <https://www.allaboutcookies.org/>
  * Network Advertising Initiative: <https://www.networkadvertising.org/>



**DO NOT TRACK**

Some web browsers permit you to set Do Not Track (DNT) signals which would prevent websites from tracking your behaviour online. The applicable standards are still being developed and as a result, we cannot respond to the DNT signal. This means our service providers are able to compile analytics about your movements on our website and remarket YapStone services to you.

**WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA**

The data (including personal data) that we collect from you may be processed, transferred and stored in the United States and may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside of the United States including but not limited to: India, Ireland, Switzerland, India, and the Philippines and Ireland.
