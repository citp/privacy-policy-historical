# Privacy Policy :: RentPayment :: E-Payments for Properties

[Print our Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20100103035127id_/http%3A//www.rentpayment.com/images/rp_privacy_policy.pdf)

Thank you for visiting RentPayment. Your privacy is important to us. In order to better protect your privacy, we have developed a privacy policy. Our privacy policy explains our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used at this site. The privacy policy is based on these principles: 

  * We will disclose how we use the information we collect; 
  * We will give you an opportunity to restrict our use of the information; 
  * We will give you an opportunity to tell us not to give the information to others; 
  * We will use commercially reasonable means to minimize the risk of unauthorized disclosures; 
  * We will use commercially reasonable means to maintain the information accurately; and 
  * We will give you an opportunity to correct the information in our records when it has been erroneously recorded. 



These principles and our policy apply whether we collect the information by paper or electronic form. 

We will disclose how we use the information we collect.

Our membership application form requires members to give us contact information (like your address, phone number, and email address). We also collect limited financial information such as a credit card number. We use the personal information primarily to provide membership services. Financial information is used solely for payment of the membership dues.

We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit many of our web pages such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows '95 or Mac OS) and the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink).

We may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our products and services, to respond to your inquiries about our offerings, and to offer you other products or services that we believe may be of interest to you.

We sometimes use this information to communicate with you when we make changes to our subscriber agreements, to fulfill a request by you for an online newsletter, or to contact you about your account with us.

We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer you products, programs, or services.

We will give you an opportunity to restrict our use of the information. We will disclose information we maintain when required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request.

We will use commercially reasonable means to minimize the risk of unauthorized disclosures.

Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Notice. Inadvertent disclosures may result, for example, when third parties misrepresent their identities in asking the site for access to personally identifiable information about themselves for purposes of correcting possible factual errors in the data.

RentPayment will not use or transfer personally identifiable information provided to us in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you with an opportunity to opt out of these unrelated uses.

We will give you an opportunity to correct the information in our records when it has been erroneously recorded.

We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect online.

To protect your privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to help verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
