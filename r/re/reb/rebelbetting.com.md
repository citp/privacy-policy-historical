When registering your username and password, you will only need to submit your email. Your IP address will in some cases be logged. No other information is collected by ClaroBet AB.

If you choose to purchase the full version of RebelBetting you will be forwarded to a selection of payment gateways where you need to be registered with name and address. All payment information (credit card information etc) is handled and stored securely by these payment gateways and can not be accessed by ClaroBet.

#### RebelBetting security

The RebelBetting software communicates with our servers to provide the user with sports arbitrage opportunities. The only information being sent to our servers is the RebelBetting username and password for authentication (both encrypted). Bookmaker usernames or passwords are never sent.

Sensitive information stored in RebelBetting like bookmaker login information is stored on the user’s computer using a master password and a “salt” with an industrial strength encryption.

Optionally, starting the program can require the master password to be entered. This means that even if your computer is compromised, the sensitive information is safe.  
(The master password can also be remembered and will then be saved encrypted bound to your machine and Windows account, we do not recommend this if you want maximum security).

Both our software and our web site is signed by certificates verifying ClaroBet AB as the owner. The software certificate also verifies that the software has not been tampered with since release.

The website rebelbetting.com and our downloads are verified by antivirus service [McAfee SiteAdvisor](http://www.siteadvisor.com/sites/rebelbetting.com).
