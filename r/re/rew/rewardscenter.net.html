				<p><strong>This privacy policy updated October 26, 2009</strong><br>
					<br>
					<strong>Our Commitment To Privacy </strong> <br>
					This  Privacy Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect and  use your personal information in connection with our advertising, content,  e-commerce, promotional and service programs and other business activities (the  "Program") and to assist you in making informed decisions when using  our site and our products and services and the sites of our advertisers.<br>
					<br>
					<strong>What Information We Collect </strong> <br>
					When  you visit our site we may collect two types of information: (a) personal  information you actively choose to disclose and (b) information about you that  is collected automatically by our servers or obtained from third parties in a  way not visible to you.<br>
				</p><ul>
					<li>(a) <u>Information you actively choose to  provide.</u> By choosing to participate in our Program, you must become a  Member by disclosing the following information, such as: your email address,  name, address, phone number and birth date. During the process of registering  on our site, participating in various offers, completing surveys, or sending us  emails or correspondence, we collect additional information that you may  disclose, including for example mobile telephone number, fax number, payment  information (e.g., credit card number and billing address), credit information,  social security number, health information and personal preferences regarding  lifestyle, products or services.</li>
					<li>(b) <u>Passive information collected  automatically by our servers or obtained from third parties.</u> We collect  some information about you simply by virtue of you connecting to our web site.  Our servers automatically identify your computer by its internet protocol  ("IP") address, a unique string of numbers that is assigned to your  computer by your internet service provider. In addition, to participate in our  program you must allow cookies to be active on your system. Cookies are a  feature of web browser software (Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, etc.)  that allows web servers to recognize which computer is used to access a web  site. Cookies simplify subsequent interactions on our site and streamline your  transactions on related web pages. Information collected through cookies may  include the date and time of your visits, the site pages you viewed, the time  spent at each page, and the web sites you visited just before and just after  our site. You can disable the cookie function by following the instructions in  the "help" section of your browser. However, doing so will likely  make it impossible for our system to properly recognize you when you visit our  sites, and consequently may make your participation in our program more  difficult or impossible. In addition to the information you provide or that is  collected automatically from our system, we may obtain information about you from  our marketing partners or other third parties, and we combine that information  with the information you actively provide or that is automatically collected by  our servers.</li>
				</ul>
					<p>The  term "Information" is used in this policy to refer to both types of  information described above, as well as any Information that you provide to us  directly by phone (including any phone number displayed via caller ID), text or  SMS message, U.S. mail or through any other written or oral communication with  us.<br>
					<br>
					<strong>Use of Data  Collected </strong> <br>
	<br>
					<br>
					<strong>OPT-IN NOTICE: By Participating, You  Expressly "Opt In" To Receive Information And Grant Us Permission To  Share Your Information</strong> <br>
					By  signing up for our Program you expressly opt in to receive future information  about products and services from us and from a variety of advertisers to whom  we may provide your Information. We will share your personal information with  third parties for any reason we choose, including without limitation for the  following purposes: (1) to operate our Program (including the transfer of the  information to advertisers or to third parties who maintain on our behalf a  list of persons having registered with our Program), (2) to permit advertisers  or other third parties to use your Information for any purpose such as  contacting you by email, phone, text message, U.S. mail or any other means of  communication for any purpose, (3) to confirm you have completed all of the  necessary steps to receive your gift, and (4) as we are required to do by law,  including to notify the IRS that you received your gift. As a result, we will  transfer your Information to third parties whose privacy policies and practices  are beyond our control.<br>
					In  addition, in the event we consider a transaction involving the purchase or sale  of our assets or stock, other companies may review our records, including your  Information, to make business decisions about the transaction. Likewise, your  Information may be transferred to third parties in the event of the sale or  acquisition of our company or any of its assets. The parties who perform  services for us (credit card processors, merchant banks, our internet service  provider, etc.) also may have access to your information in performing their  services.<br>
					<br>
					<strong>Special Note About Information You Provide  Directly To Our Advertisers.</strong> <br>
					You  are able to access certain advertiser's sites through our site. When you opt to  receive information or sign up for an offer from an advertiser, you may be  doing so through third party sites and with other companies over which we have  no control. You should read those sites' privacy policies to make sure you  agree to them before using such sites. If you wish to opt out of those  advertisers' mailings, you must do so directly with such advertisers or as  otherwise provided on or through their sites.<br>
					<br>
					<strong>Third Party Ad Servers.</strong> <br>
					We  may serve advertisements within our Web Site either ourselves or by allowing  other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to do so. In  addition, some of our advertisers may use the services of third-party ad  networks. Some of these third-party ad networks may place a persistent cookie  on your computer. Doing this allows the third-party ad network to recognize  your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way,  third-party ad networks may compile information about where you, or others who  are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are  clicked on. This information allows a third-party ad network to deliver  targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. We  do not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the  third-party ad servers or third-party ad networks. Those third-party ad  networks that use persistent cookies may offer you a way to opt-out of ad  targeting. You may find more information at the web site of either the  individual third-party ad network or the Network Advertising Initiative  (http://www.networkadvertising.org). <br>
					<br>
					<strong>Security Of Your Information.</strong> <br>
					We  use reasonable technical efforts to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure,  or accidental loss or destruction of Information. However, nearly all Internet  transmissions pass through many servers not controlled by us, and therefore we  cannot guarantee that any information you provide us or we collect will not be  intercepted or altered in that process. Also, as noted above, your Information  is shared with third parties whose privacy policies and practices are beyond  our control. <br>
					<br>
					<strong>How You Can Choose To "Opt Out" Of  Receiving Further Information About Products Or Services</strong><br>
					If  at any time you do not wish to receive further information about products or  services from us and wish us to cease providing your Information to third  parties, you may chose to "opt-out" through the  Unsubscribe/"Opt-Out" page of our site or by written request sent by  U.S. mail to our Customer Service Manager at the following address:<br>
					<br>
					RewardsCenter.net<br>
					221 N. La Salle St<br>
					Suite  1612&nbsp; <br>
					Chicago, IL 60601 <br>
					<br>
					We  will promptly update our records upon receiving your clear instructions to  opt-out, but it may take up to ten (10) business days from our receipt of your  request for the change to be fully effective. If you later give us a clear  statement that you want to receive emails from us or our advertisers after such  date, then that opt-in statement will supersede any earlier opt-out request. If  we have already provided your email address or other information to an  advertiser or other third party before we receive your opt-out request, we cannot  prevent them from sending or continuing to send you information or emails and  you will need to contact such third party directly.<br>
					<br>
					<strong>SMS Offering and Opt-out rights</strong><br>
				By completing  or submitting a registration form or partial registration form you are  consenting to receive SMS, wireless or other mobile offering to your cell  phone. You understand that your wireless carrier's standard charges and rates  apply to these messages. For SMS text messages, you may remove your information  by replying&nbsp; "STOP",  "END", or "QUIT" to the SMS text message you have received  and we will remove your personal information within 10 days of receiving such  request. This website, websites linking to this website, and websites linked from   this website (collectively "We") may make available a service either   directly or through third parties by which you can receive commercial   messages on your wireless device via short message service ("SMS   Service").   Your provider's standard data and messaging rates apply to all SMS   correspondence. All charges are billed by and payable to your mobile   service provider. You represent that you are 18 years of age and the   owner or authorized user of the wireless device on which messages   will be received, and that you are authorized to approve the applicable   charges. Data obtained from you in connection with this SMS Service   may include your name, address, cell phone number, your provider's name,   and the date, time, and content of your messages. The use of this   information will be in accordance with this Mobile Policy. </p>
					<p>If fees are   charged to your wireless account invoice, we may provide your carrier   with your applicable information in connection therewith. Your wireless   carrier and other service providers may also collect data about your   wireless device usage, and their practices are governed by their own   policies. You acknowledge and agree that the SMS Service is provided via     wireless systems which use radios (and other means) to transmit   communications over complex networks. We will not be liable for any   delays in   the receipt of any SMS messages, as delivery is subject to effective   transmission from your network operator. SMS message services are   provided   on an AS IS basis.  We do not guarantee that your use of the SMS Service   will be private or secure, and we are not liable to you for any lack of     privacy or security you may experience.  You are fully responsible for   taking precautions and providing security measures best suited for your   situation and intended use of the SMS Service. You may opt out of the   SMS Service at any time by replying "STOP", "END", or "QUIT" to the SMS   text message you have received. This process impacts only the future   delivery of the particular SMS message offering, so you must send that   message for each offering. <br><br>
	            <strong>How To Correct, Delete Or Access Your  Information</strong> <br>
					If  you wish to access, delete or correct the information you have provided to us  through this site, please contact us through the Contact Us section of our site  or through written request sent by U.S. mail to the Customer Service Manager at  the address listed above.<br>
					<br>
					<strong>Special Rights For Residents Of Certain  States</strong> <br>
					If  you are a California resident or another state with specific laws relating to  the collection and use of Information, you may have specific rights not set  forth in this policy. For example, California residents have the right to  receive: a) information identifying any third party company(ies) to whom we may  have disclosed, within the past calendar year, personal information pertaining  to you and your family for the company's direct marketing purposes; and b) a  description of the categories of personal information disclosed. To obtain such  information you must make a request in writing. Your request must include your  name registration (email address), the site name you visited and a return  address or it will not be processed. We will not honor such requests more than once  per calendar year. Requests made via email will not be accepted. Please mail  your request to Customer Service Manager at the address listed in the footer of  this site or the Contact Us page.</p>
