# RewardIt Promo

Last Updated January 9, 2012 NOT INCREASE YOUR CHANCES OF WINNING.

Sharestakes, LLC. and Rewardit.com (collectively "Rewardit", "We", "Our" or "Us") are committed to protect ing your privacy. This Privacy Policy applies to Rewardit.com and governs data collection and usage includ ing Rewardit website and email services (the "Program"). This Privacy Policy is effective upon acceptance in registration for new registering members, and is otherwise effective on the date noted above for all Rewardit members ("Members"). 

We firmly believe that both our Members and our clients benefit because we market only to people who have given us express permission to do so. 

While the word "privacy" may mean different things to different people, we believe that once you understand how we use your information, the steps we take to protect it, and the resulting benefit to you, you will not only feel confident when sharing information with us, but will also find your participation in the program a most rewarding experience. 

1\. Collection of Information  
Rewardit collects both personal and non-personal information using the methods listed below. Our primary purpose in collecting such information is to provide you with a personalized experience by displaying content and delivering offers that are likely to be of interest to you according to your preferences. 

2\. Information Collected at Registration  
To take advantage of the offers available at Rewardit, you must register for our service and become a Member. We collects personal information when you register with us and when you use the Rewardit ser vices. We may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business part ners or companies. During registration, we require members to give us basic contact information (such as your first name, last name and e-mail address) and demographic information (such as your zip code, age and gender). The registration form information requests may change from time to time. Although additional demo graphic information may be requested at the time of registration, only information marked "required" is neces sary for registration and utilization of our services. 

We do not accept registrations from persons under the age of eighteen. The site will automatically block en rollment of any person once they indicate they are under the age of eighteen. If we later learn that a user is under the age of eighteen, we will terminate the account and delete the user's information. Inherent in the Program is the responsibility of parents and/or guardians to ensure that their children's privacy is protected. Rewardit will not be liable for any content or advertisements viewed by minor children in violation of the terms of this agreement. 

3\. Automatic Information Collected though Participation in the Rewardit Program  
When you sign in to the Rewardit website, the server automatically recognizes you by your cookie. This cookie acts as a unique identifier, and is linked to your personal information, which allows us to personalize the website to your specified interests and allows you to access your personal information. It also allows us to keep track of your activity on our site and allows us to properly credit rewards to your account. This infor mation may be added to your personal profile and used to deliver offers and advertisements that are most relevant to your interests. 

The Program makes active use of third-party cookies; therefore, full participation in the Program is dependent upon you setting your browser configuration to accept third-party cookies. We also use cookies to tailor the Program to your interests and, most importantly, to ensure that only you can access your account. We also review "log-file" data to monitor site performance and analyze traffic patterns and usage of our site. 

Rewardit also retrieves the following information from your browser:   
• Your browser type (e.g., Internet Explorer)  
• Platform-dependent information (e.g., Windows)  
• Requested document (the page you're looking at)  
• Referrer URL (the page you came into the Rewardit site from)  
• Date and time of your visit  
• Your registered Rewardit account information  
• Purchase transaction detail (from merchants on the Rewardit site)  
• IP address associated with member transaction in the system  
Additionally, for each visitor to our website, our server automatically recognizes the following:   
• Host origin of the request (your IP address or that of your ISP if using proxy servers)  
• Requested document (the page you're looking at)  
• Referrer URL (the page you came into the Rewardit site from)  
• Your registered Rewardit account information   
• Date and time of your visit  
This information, sometimes called log-file or clickstream data, is used to monitor site performance and ensure the Program functions properly. It may also be appended to your personal profile so that we may fur- ther tailor the Program to your interests. 

Many of Rewardit advertisers, shopping affiliates and merchants also utilize third-party cookies to identify you as a Member. This enables them to report your purchases back to us so we are able to credit your account with your rewards. 

We and our advertisers currently use third-party cookies and clear pixel GIFs (also referred to as "web bea cons") to measure page views on both Rewardit and advertisers' web sites and email responses. These de vices allow us to identify unique visitors to Rewardit's site, member visits to advertisers' sites, and act as a counter for ongoing monitoring of site, email and corresponding future transaction activity related to a spe cific offer for both Rewardit and its advertisers. These commonly used counters collect absolutely no per sonal information and, as always, this technology is only used to enhance the program and make it more rel evant to your personal interests. 

Third-party cookies are also used to count unique page views, email responses and future transaction activity corresponding to specific offers. Rewardit will also capture and store your transaction details, which may in clude the items and quantities purchased, purchase price, date and time of purchase. This information is used to credit rewards for purchases and to adjust your account balance in the event of returns and ex changes. This information is also used by the Member Services department while assisting you in resolving account inquiries. We may also use your transaction information to provide you more timely relevant offers, products and services. 

4\. Information Collected Via Online Surveys, Sweepstakes and Other Promotions  
We also provide you the opportunity to participate in contests, sweepstakes or surveys. If you choose to par ticipate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice as to whether or not to disclose this infor mation. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping ad dress) and demographic information (such as gender and zip code).   


We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes. We may also use the information gath ered to better personalize your Program experience. 

We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys, contests and sweepstakes. That com pany is prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest, sweepstakes or survey with any third party except as allowed under this Privacy Policy or with your prior notice and choice. 

5\. Information Collected at Enrollment for a Paid or Other Enhanced Product or Service  
If you choose to enroll for any paid or other enhanced product or service beyond a basic registration as de scribed in Section 2 above, you may be required to provide us with certain contact information, such as your name, e-mail address and billing address. We may also require other information necessary to access the paid or other enhanced product or service or process any applicable payment, such as a credit card or debit card number and expiration date. We may use the information you provide us to bill you for products and services you request, or to notify you of additional products and services we may offer. When you sign up for a paid or other enhanced product or service on the Site, you are consenting to our delivery of this information to our service providers, which may include banks and credit card companies that we use to process a transaction or other third parties who may provide all or a portion of the underlying product or service on our behalf. 

6\. Use and Disclosure of Personal Information  
We do not rent, share, trade or sell your personal information to anyone for promotional purposes without your express consent. When we do share data with our advertisers it is in aggregate form and is designed to ensure you are not identified personally. If you purchase a product or service from a third party or agree to co-register on a third party's website, any of which requires you to submit financial and/or personally identifi able information, you are also consenting to our delivery of this information to that party. The offer will notify you if any financial or personally identifiable information will be shared. Such third party will be authorized to use this information in keeping with our contractual relationship with them and in accordance with their own privacy policy and information practices. We do not control these third parties and you agree that Rewardit is not liable for their acts or any failure to act on their part. 

Although we house our data in the United States, it is possible that some of our data processing may occur outside of the United States. While the data protection laws of these countries may vary, we will make every reasonable effort to protect your information based upon the express terms of this Privacy Policy. By enrolling in the Program, you consent to this transfer of your personal data. 

As long as you remain a Rewardit Member, opting not to receive email does not exempt you from receiving   
administrative emails, which include, but are not limited to, notices about vital program and membership   
status changes or alterations to our Terms of Service.  


We may, without your consent, access and disclose your personal information, any communications sent or received by you, and any other information that we may have about you or your account as may be required by law, regulation, rule or court order; pursuant to requests from governmental, regulatory or administrative agencies or law enforcement authorities; or to prevent, investigate, identify persons or organizations poten tially involved in, or take any action regarding suspected fraud, violations of our Terms of Service, or activity that appears to us to be illegal or may expose us to legal liability.   


7\. Member Communications and Email  
Rewardit employs a strict policy against sending unsolicited email. Because email is an integral part of the program, you sign up to receive email targeted to your interests at the time of enrollment. If you later decide you wish to cease participation in this portion of the program, you may do so at any time on this page: http://www.rewardit.com/unsubscribe, by clicking on the opt-out links contained within each Rewardit email or by sending an email to unsubscribe@rewardit.com. 

Please note that opting not to receive email does not exempt you from receiving administrative emails that include but are not limited to, notices about vital Program and membership status changes, Privacy Policy and Terms of Service updates and purchase and redemption confirmation emails. 

Our Member Services Department may contact you in response to your inquiries, to provide services at your request and to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email, telephone or fax in accor dance with your wishes. 

8\. Rewardit Advertisers and 3rd Party Websites  
The Rewardit website and emails contain links to various other sites that are not owned by us. While we make every effort to ensure that our advertisers post clear and complete Privacy Policies and observe appro priate data practices, each of these sites has a privacy policy that may differ from that of Rewardit. The pri vacy practices of other websites and companies are not covered by this policy. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collect personally identifiable infor mation. 

Rewardit may allow other companies, called third party ad servers or ad networks, to display advertisements on the Rewardit website or in Rewardit email. Some of these ad networks may place a persistent cookie on your computer. Doing this allows them to recognize your computer each time they send you an online adver tisement. In this way, ad networks may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. Rewardit does not have access to or control over the cookies that may be placed by these parties on your computer, and has no control over these parties' privacy policies or information collection practices. 

Except as specifically set forth below, it is our policy not to provide your personally identifiable information to our advertisers unless you make the choice to share it with them. We occasionally pass personally identifiable information via a secure interface to certain of our advertisers for the purpose of making it easier for you to sign up for their offers. However, this information is only to be used by the advertiser if you agree to submit the information to the advertiser for the purposes of completing an offer. 

We occasionally use third parties to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, processing transactions, or performing statistical analy sis of our services. We will only provide these third parties the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. 

In the event that we were unable to capture your transaction detail, Rewardit may need to validate your trans action with an advertiser or merchant partner to ensure that your account is credited with the correct number of rewards. The validation information shared is used solely for this purpose and may include your first name, last name, email address, mailing address or date of birth. We will require that these third parties comply with the information practices set forth in this Privacy Promise and that the information not be shared or used for any other purpose. 

9\. Testimonials  
Our users may submit testimonials about Rewardit on our site. In such cases, it is the user's ded choice as to whether their personally identifiable information is posted along with the testimonial. In addition, Rewardit has forums available to its users that allow them to post opinions or testimonials about third-party products and services. You should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit through these forums can be read, collected or used by other users of these forums, which they could then use to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums. 

10\. Refer-a-Friend  
If you elect to use any of our referral services for informing friends about our site, you will be asked to provide your friends' names and e-mail addresses. You may enter this information manually, or you can also choose to import your contacts from your email address book, in which case you will be asked to provide us with your email address and password, which will be used solely for the purpose of importing your contacts within the referral service. We will then automatically send your friends a one-time e-mail, plus a reminder email (both of which may include your name and email address) inviting them to visit our site. We ask for this infor mation for the sole purpose of sending these emails and tracking the success of our referral program. 

11\. Data Verification and Supplementation  
Data verification involves the use of third-party data processing services to standardize and clean your pro vided enrollment information so that it is easily identified and accessed in our database. Data supplementa tion involves appending any publicly available information about you to your personal profile. 

In order to provide you with the most rewarding experience, we might send your information to data proces sors so that they can clean your address and standardize to ensure it is most accurate and up-to-date. Next, we might seek out any information about you that is publicly available on the open market and overlay this data onto ours for comparison purposes. Information collected in this manner could include your spending habits from a mail-order catalogue, demographic information you provided in entering a sweepstakes, or your financial history. All of this results in a program that is tailored to your personal interests and provides you with the most relevant reward-earning opportunities. 

We use this information solely for the purpose of enhancing the offerings of the Program, namely to tailor ad vertisements, updates, and reward-earning and spending offers to your particular interests. All such third party data processors are contractually bound to observe the strict policy stated herein, so you can rest as sured that the confidentiality of your personal information will be maintained. 

12\. Security  
Rewardit has established company-wide industry-standard security practices for your protection. In some instances, we may use contractors or vendors to help us provide some of the services at our site. If we dis close personal information for them to provide the services, it is with the requirement that the information is kept confidential and used only for those services. All contractors and employees are required to familiarize themselves with, and abide by, these safeguards.   


13\. Changes to this Privacy Policy  
We may amend this policy from time to time. If we make any material changes in the way we use your per sonally identifiable information we will notify you by email and at the top of this Privacy Policy web page. For questions and concerns about the information collected or used at this site, please contact memberservices@rewardit.com.  


14\. Mergers; Business Transitions  
In the event Rewardit goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another com- pany, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred, unless such a transfer will violate state or federal law.
