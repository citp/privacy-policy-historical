We take your privacy very seriously at Rewordify.com, and we protect it with the following policies:

**Minimum information.** We want to teach you. That's all. We don't want to spam you, make money off of you, or sell your information to anyone. So, we only ask for the _minimum information_ to register. We don't need (or ask for) your name, or any other personal information. You may register with an anonymous user name or with your email address. We strongly recommend using your email address, so we can help you if you forget your password.

**Data privacy.** We will keep all of your information private. We'll never tell anyone your email address or your username, unless we are given a court order to do so. We do not display your username on documents you create. We display only a partial user name on the screen after you log in, to make it difficult for malicious people to tamper with your account. We don't display social media login buttons, because we don't want giant corporations to collect personally-identifiable data about what you do on our site.

**No spam.** If you register with your email address, we won't send you emails, unless we're responding to a message from you.

**Strong encryption.** We store your password using the strongest encryption method available. If criminals breached our security measures and accessed our user database, it is _extremely unlikely_ that they could discover your password.

**Secure practices.** Everything you do on the site is protected by the strongest TLS security measures available. It is _extremely unlikely_ that anyone could impersonate you, discover your password, or monitor what you do on the site. In addition, we implement our own security measures to make it _extremely difficult_ for a malicious user to access or tamper with your account.

**Anonymous browsing data is collected.** We do collect _anonymous_ information about what users do on our site, such as which pages they visit, what geographical area they're from, etc. We do this so we can improve our site. Nothing we collect is connected in any way with your account.
