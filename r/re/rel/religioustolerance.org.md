# OCRT Privacy statement

### 

**Click Here to Visit our Sponsors.**  

### Overview:

This statement also applies to **ReligiousTolerance.com,** **ReligiousTolerance.ca** and **ReligiousDivrsity.info** which automatically redirect readers to **ReligiousTolerance.org**  

### Why a privacy statement?

Surveys have indicated that almost all users of the Internet are concerned about their personal privacy while surfing the web. ******1** One way of addressing these concerns is for individual web sites to publish their privacy policy. Unfortunately, many have not yet done so.

The _Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance_ has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to our readers' privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: **ReligiousTolerance.org**. We have also added some material on our site's contents and external links. 

If you have any concerns, please [Email us.](mailto:ocrt@religioustolerance.org?subject=PRIVACY)

### Information that we can access:

| | **CIHost:** This is the Texas company that hosts our web site. Like essentially all other web hosting services, they collect information such as IP addresses, time of access, essay URL, etc. from all of the visitors to the web sites on their computers. These data are stored in daily log files in our directory. We are unable to read these files; they cannot be viewed in any programs that we have available. However, we do indirectly access these data once a week. We analyze the files using the _Wusage 7.1_ program. This program supplies us with a statistical report indicating the total number of hits, the distribution of hits as a function of hour of day and day of week, and the numbers of hits that each of our essays received. The statistical report prepared by this program contains no identifying information; it tells us absolutely nothing about individual visitors to our web site.   
---|---  
| **Hitbox.com:** About 10 of our most popular essays contain a _Hitbox.com_ logo. Hitbox collects information about each visitor to these essays. They make selected data available to us in various forms. Almost all of the data (level of traffic, the search engine from where they are referred, the browsers that they use, etc.) are only reported as totals or averages of all visitors. For example, Hitbox tells us that 59% of our visitors use Microsoft Internet Explorer, 41% use Netscape and 1% use other browsers. Almost all use version 4 or 5; 3% use version 3; less than 1% use other browsers. This sort of information helps us design our pages for optimum viewing. The _Last 100 visits_ subsection of their _visitor_ section does list individual host computer names and IP addresses. However, as a matter of policy, we have only viewed this screen on one occasion, in order to see its format.  
  
### What information do we share?

The only information that we share is on our web site for all to see:

### External links from our web site:

### Incoming E-mails:

Any E-mails that we receive which describe a personal problem are answered as quickly as possible, and then deleted.

Unfortunately, our incoming traffic is so high that we cannot answer all E-mails. In particular, we cannot enter into continuing discussions. We would like to, but time does not permit. 

About one out of every thousand E-mails contains a thought provoking theological comment or question that we discuss on our [web site](http://religioustolerance.org/questions.htm). These are questions like " _Who is a Christian?_ " " _What religion should I follow_?" " _Can therapy change gays?_ " etc. We paraphrase the incoming E-mail and remove any identifying information before posting it to our web site. For example, we might identify the Email as coming from a teacher, but we would not reveal the person's name, age, gender, city or state.

### Child visitors:

A [poll of our readers](https://web.archive.org/web/20030622101321id_/http%3A//religioustolerance.org/poll_dat.htm) has indicated that 0.2% are under 13 years of age. The _Children's Online Privacy Protection Act_ became effective in the U.S. on 2000-APR-21. **2** It requires compliance from commercial web sites which:

We do not believe that our site qualifies under either of these criteria.

### Public Forums:

This site makes a message board available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information in the sense that anyone, anywhere in the world has access to it. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal information. 

### Security:

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Our web site is under continual attack by abusive hackers who attempt to modify our essays and menus. Almost all of the modifications have occurred to our essays on abortion, and homosexuality. One hacker was a little more imaginative. They  briefly added an audio file to our home page -- a song about vampires.
