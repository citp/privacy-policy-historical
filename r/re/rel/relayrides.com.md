# Privacy Policy

Last revised: April 11, 2014

RelayRides provides an online marketplace for car rentals. This Privacy Policy describes RelayRides’ commitments to you with respect to RelayRides’ use of information collected in connection with the RelayRides marketplace.

While RelayRides may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time, we will always abide by the terms of the Privacy Policy in place when we collected your information. Please note, if we make any material changes to our Privacy Policy, we will provide you with notice concerning the changes either on this page or through some other reasonable method.

### Information We Collect through the Marketplace

As used in this Privacy Policy, the term “personal information” means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile number, e-mail address, or other account number). Personal information also includes demographic information such as date of birth, gender, geographic area and preferences when that information is linked to other personal information that identifies the individual. Personal information does not include “aggregate” information, which is data we collect about the use of the RelayRides marketplace or about a group or category of products, services or users, if all personal information has been removed.

When you offer your car for rent through the RelayRides marketplace, we will ask you for certain personal information including your name, contact information and information about your car. We may also require additional financial information from you to facilitate payment to you and to process any filings required by applicable tax authorities. When you rent a car through the RelayRides marketplace, we will ask you for your name, contact information, payment information and information concerning your driver’s license and driver’s record. We will maintain records for a reasonable period concerning your registration with and use of the RelayRides marketplace, including any correspondence you have with us.

We automatically collect certain information through the use of “cookies” or clear gifs. Cookies are small data files that are stored on a user’s hard drive at the request of a Web site to enable the site to recognize users who have previously visited them and retain certain information such as customer preferences and history. Clear gifs (also know as web bugs or web beacons) are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on the site or in emails relating to the site to collect certain information and monitor user activity on the site. If we combine cookies with or link them to any of the personally identifying information, we would treat this information as personal information. If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn about these functions. However, if a browser is set not to accept cookies or if a user rejects a cookie, some portions of the site may not function properly.

We reserve the right to review and store the communications you make through the site, including your postings on site pages and your communications to other members using the marketplace’s messaging capabilities. We may use those communications for internal purposes, including to better understand how members use the marketplace, as well as for security purposes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we are not obligated or required to review any communications and make no commitment to do so or to take any specific action with respect to those communications.

RelayRides also logs each visit to each web page on the site. The log may contain information such as the browser type you used, your Internet Protocol address, and the date and time of day of the visit. We may also log your cookie’s identification number and the URL of the last site you visited. This log information is important for security, audit, quality improvement, as well as for monitoring the health of our marketplace.

If your car or a car you rent through the marketplace includes an in-car device, RelayRides will log and retain information recorded by the in-car device, such as location, mileage and other aspects of your use of the car during a rental period. If the in-car device is operated by a third party service, e.g. OnStar, that service may record information about your use of the car. The third party service will be solely responsible to you for its use of such information.

### Use of Information and Information Verification

RelayRides will use your personal information solely for its internal business purposes in connection with the provision of the RelayRides marketplace. That includes use of your information: to facilitate our administration and operation of the marketplace; to understand better how our users engage with the marketplace; to verify your account information; to process your requests and transactions; to provide you with information or services you request; and to inform you about other promotions or products or services we think will be of interest to you.

RelayRides will use third party services to verify the personal information you provide to us and to obtain additional related information and corrections where applicable. You hereby authorize RelayRides to request, receive, use and store such information for a reasonable period of time. In addition, you agree that personal information provided by you may be linked together or merged with other personal information so that we may better understanding of your account information and your use of the marketplace. In any case, this Privacy Policy governs any information we maintain about you and your use of the marketplace.

### Disclosure of Information

RelayRides does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others. We will not share the personal information we collect from you through the marketplace with third parties except as described in this Privacy Policy.

RelayRides enables car owners to offer and rent their vehicles to other individuals. If you agree to a rental transaction through the RelayRides marketplace, RelayRides may provide your personal information to the other party in that transaction as reasonably necessary to facilitate the rental. For example, RelayRides may provide your mobile phone number to facilitate communication or your photograph to facilitate identification.

In addition to information verification providers described above, we may share personal information with vendors and service providers who are engaged by or working with us in connection with the operation of our site and marketplace and who need access to such information to carry out their work for us. In some cases, the service provider may be directly collecting the information from you on our behalf. RelayRides will endeavor to choose service providers that are well established and who have agreed to protect the confidentiality of any personal information the service provider receives. RelayRides is not responsible for the act or omissions of its service providers.

If RelayRides offers or promotes services in conjunction with another company, and you request those services (or additional information about them), you consent to our sharing your personal information with those parties. In those cases, we will only share the information reasonably needed to provide you with the applicable service. We may also share personal information with third parties when you give us your consent to do so. Information that is shared with third parties as described in this paragraph is subject to the privacy policies of those parties, which may differ from this Privacy Policy. RelayRides is not responsible for the acts or omissions of those third parties. We encourage you to become familiar with their practices before disclosing information directly to them.

RelayRides may compile aggregate information about the use of the marketplace. In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and our users’ needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our marketplace. RelayRides may also share aggregate demographic information with advertisers and partners. This policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.

RelayRides may disclose personal information in the good faith belief that we are lawfully authorized or required to do so, or that doing so is reasonably necessary or appropriate to comply with the law or with legal process or authorities, respond to any claims, or to protect the rights, property or safety of RelayRides, our users, our employees or the public. That includes actions we may take to protect RelayRides or our users from fraudulent, abusive, inappropriate or unlawful use of our site or marketplace. Information about our users, including personal information, may also be disclosed or transferred as part of, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition or in any other situation where personal information may be transferred as one of the business assets of RelayRides.

You understand that when you use the site, information you post in your profile or in any other area of the site will be available to other users and in some cases may be publicly available.

### Security

We have endeavored to put into place reasonable security measures in an effort to protect personal information while it is under our control. We are not responsible for any unauthorized disclosure of personal or other information caused by any third party. Your account information is accessible online through the use of a password. To protect the confidentiality of personal information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You are responsible for all uses of our web site by any person using your password. Please advise us immediately if you believe your password has been misused.
