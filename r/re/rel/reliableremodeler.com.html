<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>We at ReliableRemodeler.com, Inc. are committed to respecting your online privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you share with us.</p>

<p>Reliable has established this Online PRIVACY POLICY so that you can understand the care with which we intend to treat your Personal Information.</p>

<p>Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a home or other physical address and an email address or other contact information. In general, you can visit Reliable's Web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself.</p>

<p>If you choose to provide us with your Personal Information on the Web, we may transfer that Information within Reliable, its affiliated companies, its clients or to Reliable's third-party service providers, across borders, and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.</p>

<p>Reliable strives to comply with all applicable laws around the globe that are designed to protect your privacy. Although legal requirements may vary from country to country, Reliable intends to adhere to the principles set forth in this Online PRIVACY POLICY even if, in connection with the above, we transfer your Personal Information from your country to countries that may not require an "adequate" level of protection for your Personal Information. In other words, our goal is to provide protection for your Personal Information no matter where that Personal Information is collected, transferred, or retained.</p>

<h2>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h2>

<p>Some of our Web pages utilize "cookies" and other tracking technologies. A "cookie" is a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect information about Web site activity.

<p>Tracking technologies may record information such as Internet domain and host names; Internet protocol (IP) addresses; browser software and operating system types; clickstream patterns; and dates and times that our site is accessed. Our use of cookies and other tracking technologies allows us to improve our website and your Web experience.

<h2><a name="Notice">Notice</a></h2>
