# Privacy Policy | RELEVANT Magazine

RELEVANT Media Group, Inc. ("RELEVANT," “we” or “our”) respects  
the privacy concerns of the visitors to RELEVANTmagazine.com (the  
"Website"). As a general policy, no personal information is  
automatically collected from users of the site. In the event that we do  
collect any personally identifiable data about visitors to this site,  
that information is only collected on a voluntary basis, and it is only  
known to RELEVANT.

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. Your use of and/or  
registration on any aspect of the Website will constitute your  
agreement to this Privacy Policy. If you cannot agree to the terms and  
conditions of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Website. This  
Privacy Policy does not cover information collected elsewhere,  
including without limitation offline and on sites linked to from the  
Website.

This Privacy Policy may be modified from time to time; the date  
of the most recent revisions will appear on this page, so check back  
often. Continued access of RELEVANTmagazine.com by you will constitute  
your acceptance of any changes or revisions to the Privacy Policy.

**I. THE TYPE OF INFORMATION THE WEBSITE COLLECTS**

The Website may collect personal information with your knowledge and  
consent. For instance, when you enter a sweepstakes or contest,  
complete a survey, make a purchase, subscribe to our magazine or  
newsletter(s), or register for any portion of our services, you may be  
asked to provide information such as your e-mail address, name, address  
or phone number. Additional information such as your age or gender may  
also be requested.

Certain non-personal information of visitors is recorded by the  
standard operation of RELEVANT's Internet servers, including without  
limitation the type of browser software you use, the operating system  
you are running, the website that referred you, and the domain name of  
the visitor's Internet service provider. 

**II. HOW THE WEBSITE USES INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU**

  
RELEVANT uses this information to provide you with the service you have  
requested. For instance, if you subscribe to any of our publications we  
may use your e-mail address to send you a confirmation notice and your  
mailing address to send you the publication. In the same way, if you  
enter an online sweepstakes, we will use this information to notify you  
if you are a winner. We may also use the information to communicate  
with you about new features, products or services, and/or to improve  
the services that we offer by tailoring them to your needs.

All such personal information is retained by RELEVANT and is not  
sold or otherwise transferred outside the company unless we obtain your  
express consent to do so or if we are required by law or by  
court/governmental order to disclose such information in a particular  
circumstance. This data, in aggregate, non-personally-identifying form,  
may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising or other  
uses. If you do not wish to receive further commercial communications  
from us by e-mail, simply follow the unsubscribe instructions contained  
within the e-mail. If you’ve registered on any part of the Website,  
please use the mechanism on the Website that allows you to change or  
update your member preferences or information, if available, to keep  
all such data accurate and up-to-date.

**III. COOKIES**

This site also uses "cookies," which are pieces of information that  
are transferred to an individual user's hard drive for record-keeping  
purposes. RELEVANT never uses cookies to retrieve information from your  
computer that was not originally sent in a cookie and the cookie itself  
does not contain any personally identifying information. Cookies  
function by saving your passwords and site preferences - and as a  
result, it is possible to speed up your future activities at our site  
and allow us to provide you information specifically tailored to your  
interests. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you  
would prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert  
you when cookies are being sent. However, it may be possible that some  
parts of the site will not function optimally if you do so.

**IV. CHILDREN AND PARENTS**

This website is not intended for use by children, especially those  
under age 13. In compliance with the Federal Children's Online Privacy  
Protection Act, no personal information (including name, mailing  
address, telephone number and email address) will be collected from any  
visitor under the age of 13. Minors between the ages of 13 and 17 must  
first obtain verifiable consent from the parent or legal guardian  
before making purchases, including subscriptions, on this site. Parents  
or legal guardians may provide RELEVANT with consent to collect such  
information by e-mail, by facsimile or by postal mail at the  
number/addresses set forth below under "Contact Us."

If your children disclose information about themselves in our public  
discussion forum they may get unsolicited messages from other parties.  
You should consider using parental control tools available from online  
services and software manufacturers to help supervise your children's  
online activities. These tools can also prevent children from  
disclosing their name, address, and other personal information online  
without parental permission. 

If you're worried about your children's activities or their privacy  
on our site, we encourage you to contact us as described below.
