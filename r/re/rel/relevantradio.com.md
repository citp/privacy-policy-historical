# Privacy Statement | Footer | Main Navigation

## 

Relevant Radio® is committed to protecting your privacy. Relevant Radio is a general audience web site, intended for users of all ages. Personal information of all users is collected, used and disclosed as described in this Privacy Statement.

**  
Collection of your Personal Information**

When making donations, Relevant Radio collects personal information, such as your email address, name, home or work address, and telephone number.  If you choose to make online donations, we will collect additional personal information, including your credit card number and billing address, in order to process the transaction.

**  
Use of your Personal Information**

Relevant Radio collects and uses your personal information to deliver the services you have requested (such as email correspondence and credit card billing). Relevant Radio does not use or disclose any personal information without your explicit consent.

Relevant Radio may contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.

Relevant Radio does not sell, rent, exchange or lease its customer lists to third parties.   We may occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. We will only provide those companies the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.  
Relevant Radio may access and/or disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Relevant Radio or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Relevant Radio; or (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Relevant Radio services or members of the public.

Personal information collected on this site may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Relevant Radio or its subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using this site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.

**  
Control your Personal Information**

Relevant Radio offers choices for the collection, use and sharing of personal information. You may choose not to receive marketing material from Relevant Radio. You may also stop the delivery of future promotional email from Relevant Radio by following the specific instructions in the email you receive. The instructions explain how to stop receiving such emails.

There are some Relevant Radio services that send out periodic emails informing you of technical service issues, service surveys, new feature announcements, and news about Relevant Radio products and services. You will not be able to unsubscribe to these mailings, as they are considered a part of the service you have chosen.

**  
Security of your Personal Information**

Relevant Radio is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities. When we transmit highly confidential information (such as a credit card number) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

**  
Use of Cookies**

Relevant Radio may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.  One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you register with the Relevant Radio site or services, a cookie helps Relevant Radio to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to Relevant Radio, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Relevant Radio features that you customized.  
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Relevant Radio services or Web sites you visit.
