							<h2>Salesforce.com RelateIQ Service Web site Privacy Statement</h2>

							<h3>Privacy Statement Effective as of August 7, 2014</h3><p>Salesforce.com, Inc. and its affiliates (“salesforce.com” or the “Company”) are committed to protecting the privacy of individuals who visit the Company's Web sites and individuals who register to use the Services as defined below. This Web Site Privacy Statement describes the Company's privacy practices in relation to the use of the Company's Web sites and the related applications and services offered by Salesforce.com under the “RelateIQ” brand, and which applications and services are accessible via the Company Web site listed below or through Google Play™ or the Apple iTunes App StoreSM (the “RelateIQ Service” or our “Services”). To learn more about the Company's privacy practices relating to content that is accessed, used and maintained in connection with the provision of the Services, please visit the Indexed Content Privacy Statement.</p><p>RelateIQ complies with the U.S. – EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S. - Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal data from the European Union member countries and Switzerland. RelateIQ has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view RelateIQ's certification, please visit http://www.export.gov/safeharbor.</p><p>The TRUSTe program covers the collection, use, and disclosure of information the Company collects through its website, www.relateiq.com, and the Service. While the TRUSTe program does not cover information that may be collected through the Company's mobile applications, RelateIQ strictly applies this privacy policy to our applications on all Devices, as defined below. The use of information collected through our service shall be limited to the purpose of providing the RelateIQ Service to our clients and Customers (as defined below).</p>

								<h3>1. Web Sites Covered</h3>

								<p>This Privacy Statement covers the information practices of the Company's Web sites that link to this Privacy Statement, including www.relateiq.com (collectively referred to as the “Company's Web sites”). The Company's Web sites may contain links to other Web sites. The information practices or the content of such other Web sites are governed by the privacy statements of such other Web sites. The Company encourages you to review the privacy statements of other Web sites to understand their information practices.</p><p>This Privacy Statement also covers the use of the RelateIQ Service through applications on Devices and APIs. A “Device” is any device used to access the RelateIQ Service, including without limitation a computer, mobile phone, tablet, or other electronic device. By using our Services you are consenting to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

								<h3>2. Information Collected</h3>

								<h4>The Information We Collect And Store</h4><p>Salesforce.com collects individually-identifiable information (“Personal Information”) from individuals who visit the Company's Web sites (“Web Site Visitors”) and individuals who register to use the Services (“Customers”). When expressing an interest in obtaining additional information about the Services or registering to use the Services, salesforce.com may require you to provide the Company with personal contact information, including your name, company name, phone number, and email address (“Required Contact Information”). When purchasing the Services, salesforce.com may require you to provide the Company with financial qualification and billing information, such as billing name and address, credit card number, and the number of employees within the organization that will be using the Services (“Billing Information”). Salesforce.com may also ask you to provide, or otherwise allow you to share, additional information, which you may choose to share in your registration for or use of the Services (“Optional Information”). For example, salesforce.com may obtain Optional Information by asking a Customer to import his or her contacts and email history by granting salesforce.com access to the Customer's third party services (for example, the Customer's email account) or to use the Customer's social networking information if the Customer gives us access to his or her account on a social network service. In order to use the RelateIQ Service, a Customer must link a third party email account to the Customer's RelateIQ Service account. We then import, create, and update versions of the Customer's address book and emails for the Customer to access in the RelateIQ Service. A Customer will also have the option to import and update versions of his or her calendar, social media contacts, and mobile phone call history, and the Customer can later choose to upload files to, or provide comments through, our Services. Required Contact Information, Billing Information, and Optional Information about Customers are referred to collectively as “Data About Customers”.   With your permission (which you grant by signing up for or using our Services), salesforce.com collects and stores information you provide or that we collect in order to administer our Services and/or as otherwise described in this Privacy Statement or our Terms of Service. If you or another user uploads a file or data to the RelateIQ Service that has been previously uploaded by you or another user, we may associate all or a portion of the previous file or data with the applicable accounts rather than storing duplicates. In other words, information you provide that relates to a particular person may be added to or associated with data provided by another individual that relates to that same particular person.  If a Customer ceases to use our Services, information that Customer provided may continue to be incorporated into data provided through the RelateIQ Service.</p><p>As you navigate the Company's Web sites or use the Services, salesforce.com may also collect information through the use of commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons (“Web Site Navigational Information”). Web Site Navigational Information includes standard information from your Web browser (such as browser type and browser language), your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, HTTP header information, and the actions you take on the Company's Web sites (such as the Web pages viewed and the links clicked). For additional information about the collection of Web Site Navigational Information by salesforce.com and others, please review Section 3 of this Privacy Statement.</p>

								<h3>3. Web Site Navigational Information</h3>

								<p>Salesforce.com uses commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons, to collect information from your Device as you navigate the Company's Web sites, interact with e-mails sent by the Company on its own behalf, or use the Services (“Web Site Navigational Information”). This section describes the types of Web Site Navigational Information used on the Company's Web sites and in connection with the Services, and how this information may be used.</p><h4>Cookies</h4><p>Salesforce.com uses cookies and Javascript to make interactions with the Company's Web sites easy and meaningful. When you visit one of the Company's Web sites, open e-mail from the Company, or use the Services online, salesforce.com's servers or an authorized third party may send a cookie to your Device. Cookies allow the Company to track overall Web site usage, to determine areas that Visitors prefer, and to make your visits to the Company's Web sites easier by recognizing you and providing you with a customized experience. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you; they merely recognize your Web browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to salesforce.com, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or filling out a Web form (such as a “Contact Me”), you remain anonymous to the Company. For a more thorough explanation of what cookies are and how they operate, including how to see which cookies have been set and how to manage or delete them, please visit www.aboutcookies.org or www.allaboutcookies.org.</p><p>Salesforce.com uses cookies that are session-based and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during one session, i.e., only while you are reading or navigating the Company's Web sites. They disappear from your Device when you close your browser software or turn off your Device. Persistent cookies remain on your Device after you close your browser or turn off your Device. Please note that if you disable your Web browser's ability to accept cookies, you will be able to navigate the Company's Web sites, but the functionality and features of the Services may be affected, and you may not be able to successfully use the Services. Similarly, if you disable JavaScript, some features of the Company's Web sites may not function properly, and some areas of the Company's Web sites may not function at all.

					</tbody></table><p>Cookies that are used as part of the Services (in the proxy) may include cookies of a third party Web site that is being co-browsed, for example, in order to deliver the Web site as intended by the third party Web site operator. The cookie practices of such Web sites are governed by their own respective privacy statements. The Company encourages you to review the privacy statements of other Web sites to understand their information practices.</p><h4>Web Beacons</h4><p>Salesforce.com, or third parties with whom we contract, may use Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about Customers and Web Site Visitors' usage of the Company's Web sites and interaction with emails from the Company. Web beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on your Device, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular Web site tied to the Web beacon, and a description of a Web site tied to the Web beacon. For example, salesforce.com may place Web beacons in marketing emails that notify the Company when you click on a link in the email that directs you to one of the Company's Web sites. Salesforce.com uses Web beacons to operate and improve the Company's Web sites and email communications and track the clicking of links or opening of emails.</p><h4>IP Addresses, URLs, and other Site Data</h4><p>Due to Internet communications standards, when you visit or use the Company's Web sites, we automatically receive the URL of the Web site from which you came and the Web site to which you go when you leave the Company's Web sites. We also receive your Device's Internet Protocol (IP) address (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your Device's operating system, the type of Web browser you are using, and your Internet Service Provider (ISP). We may also collect information about the web page visited before or after you came to our website, information you search for on our website, locale preferences, identification numbers associated with your Devices, your mobile carrier, date and time stamps associated with transactions, system configuration information, metadata, and interactions with the Service.  This information is used to analyze overall trends to help us improve the Service and to track and aggregate non-personal information. For example, salesforce.com uses IP addresses to monitor the regions from which Customers and Web Site Visitors navigate the Company's Web sites.</p><p>Salesforce.com may collect aggregated data regarding use of the Services and the Company's Web sites including, without limitation, the number of Web Site Visitors to the Company's Web sites, frequency and patterns of use, tag usage, and usage trends (“Aggregated Data”). Salesforce.com uses Aggregated Data as a statistical measure and not in a manner that would identify you personally. Aggregated Data enables us to determine how often certain parts of the Company's Web sites or the Services are used so that we can improve them. Salesforce.com may make use of, or make such Aggregated Data available to, third parties, in any manner in our sole discretion.</p><h4>Social Media Features</h4><p>The Company's Web sites may use social media features, such as the Facebook ‘like' button (“Social Media Features”). These features may collect your IP address and which page you are visiting on the Company's Web sites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. You may be given the option by such Social Media Features to post information about your activities on the Company's Web sites to a profile page of yours that is provided by a third party Social Media network in order to share with others within your network. Social Media Features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the Company's Web sites. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the relevant Social Media Features.</p><h4>Do Not Track</h4><p>Currently, various browsers – including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari – offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to Web sites' visited by the user about the user's browser DNT preference setting. Salesforce.com does not currently commit to responding to browsers' DNT signals with respect to the Company's Web sites, in part, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent. Salesforce.com takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.</p>

								<h3>4. Use of Information Collected</h3>

								<h4>Use of Data About Customers</h4><p><em>Data About Customers.</em> Data About Customers is or may be used: (i) to provide and improve our Services, (ii) to administer your use of our Services, (iii) to recommend follow-up reminders, assign tasks, or personalize the service, and (iv) to provide or offer software updates and product announcements. If you no longer wish to receive communications from us that are not required for the Service, please follow the "unsubscribe" instructions provided in any of those communications, or update your account settings information.</p><p><em>Geo-Location Information.</em> Some Devices allow applications to access real-time location-based information (for example, GPS).
