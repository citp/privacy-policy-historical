<p class="mt20"><strong>3.</strong> User Information:</p>
<p class="mt20 ml20"><strong>i.</strong> When you use the Website, we collect and store your personal information from you.

Importantly, we only collect personal information about you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose.</p>
<p class="mt20 ml20"><strong>ii.</strong> In general, you can browse the Website without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. To fully use the Website, you will need to register using our online registration form.
