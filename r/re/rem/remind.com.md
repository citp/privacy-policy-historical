You are responsible for any Content you provide in connection with the Services. We cannot control the actions of anyone with whom you or any other Remind users may choose to share information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that Content you or any user posts on the Services will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. Although we may allow our users to set privacy options that limit access to certain parts of the Services, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable and that we are not responsible for circumvention of any security measures contained on the Services. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of Content may remain viewable in cached pages and archives or if other users have copied or stored your Content. 

You may request removal of Personal Information (as described below) that you have provided to us by contacting us at [contact@remindhq.com](mailto:contact@remindhq.com). We will remove your Personal Information from our database on your request, but this information may remain in our server logs as part of our standard backup procedures. A verified Organization administrator or Organizer may be able to upload and provide information about you to your account; if you would like to remove or amend that information, you may have to contact and work directly with that administrator or Organizer.

##### What this is saying

Please keep in mind that you’re responsible for the content of your account and all your messages.

* * *

### What does this privacy policy cover?

This Privacy Policy explains how Remind collects and uses information from you and other users who access or use the Services, including our treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”). Also, this Privacy Policy covers Remind’s treatment of any Personal Information that our partners share with us, or that you provide to Remind through a third party website or service while using the Services. This policy does not apply to websites, services or practices of companies that we do not own or control, even if they help us operate our Services. 

##### What this is saying

Here’s what this policy covers: all information that you provide to us and that we collect while you’re using Remind. This policy doesn’t cover 3rd party companies that we don’t control but who help us operate our service. Keep reading, there’s more about this later! 

* * *

### How is children’s personal information treated?

We have included some information below related to the Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act (“COPPA”). COPPA requires that online service providers obtain parental consent or provide notice before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13 (“underage users”). Pursuant to COPPA, we may collect an underage user’s name (first name and last initial), date of birth, email address and/or telephone number in order to operate and provide the Services, and we may collect the underage user’s parent’s (or legal guardian’s) email address in order to provide notice to the child’s parent or guardian that we may contact the underage user for the purpose of allowing access to and use of the Services. If Remind does not receive the parent’s email address within a reasonable time period, the underage user will not be able to receive any messages and **his/her personally identifiable information will be deleted**. If an underage user’s Remind account is inactive for at least twelve months (meaning, the account has not received a message through the Services in that period of time), Remind’s policy is to delete the Personal Information. If we learn we have collected Personal Information from an underage user other than pursuant to the above, or if we learn that an underage user has provided us Personal Information beyond what we request from him or her, we will delete that information as quickly as possible after we have identified it. If you believe that an underage user may have provided us Personal Information in violation of this paragraph, please contact us at [report@remindhq.com](mailto:report@remindhq.com). 

##### What this is saying

Remind collects limited Personal Information from users under 13, and notifies their parent or guardian when collecting Personal Information. We delete an underage user’s account if we do not have a parent or guardian’s associated email address, or if the account has been inactive for at least 12 months. Any questions or concerns? Just email us! [contact@remindhq.com](mailto:contact@remindhq.com)

* * *

### What information does Remind display or collect?

When you use the Services, you may set up your personal profile, send messages, perform searches and queries, and transmit information through various channels as permitted by the functionality of the Services. Remind will not display your personal contact information to other users without your permission. The information we gather from users enables us to verify user identity, allows our users to set up a user account and profile through the Services, and helps us personalize and improve our Services. We retain this information to provide the Services to you and our other users and to provide a useful user experience. When you update your information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time in case you need to need to go back to that version. 

##### What this is saying

The information you provide to us by creating an account (or when joining a class or group) is used to deliver our service to you. For example, we use this information to verify your identity and help you create an account on Remind. We will not share personal contact information, besides your full name, to other users on Remind without your permission. 

* * *

### Information you provide to us

We receive and store any information you knowingly enter on the Services, whether via computer, mobile phone, other wireless device, or that you provide to us in any other way. With your express consent, you may be able to upload, import or sync contact information from your mobile device (for example, from your address book) to Remind. This information may include Personal Information such as your name, phone numbers, email addresses, photographs, and, in certain circumstances, your school and/or district, class, group, club, team or Organization affiliation (which may be used to validate your account or to provide you with notifications via the Services from a teacher, school and/or district, class, group, club, team or affiliated Organization (“Notifications”)), or any other information necessary for us to provide our Services. For underage users, we collect a name (first name and last initial), date of birth, email address and/or telephone number, and that underage user’s parent’s email address to provide notice to the parent regarding the Services. You may choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the Personal Information we receive about you to provide you with the Services and also for purposes such as: 

  * authenticating your identity,
  * responding to your requests for certain information,
  * customizing the features that we make available to you,
  * suggesting relevant services or products for you to use,
  * improving the Services and internal operations (including troubleshooting, testing, and analyzing usage),
  * communicating with you about new features
  * and, most importantly, protecting our users and making sure our Services are safe and secure.



You may modify or remove your Personal Information at any time by logging into your account and accessing features to edit your classes, groups, and/or account information. If an Organizer or a verified Organization administrator uploads or adds information about you to your account, you may have to contact and work directly with that Organizer or administrator in order to modify or remove that information. 

##### What this is saying

The information you provide to Remind is also used to analyze usage and improve our products and services. We don’t show or share your personal information without your permission except in the few circumstances described here. We may also review account information to protect the safety of our community. 

* * *

### Information collected automatically

We receive and store certain types of information whenever you use the Services. Remind automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, Remind cookie information, the page you requested, and other usage information such as your activity on the Services, the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components (similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show). None of this information constitutes Personal Information. Certain information that is collected automatically, such as device ID and phone number, will be treated as Personal Information. 

We also may provide to our partners aggregate information derived from automatically collected information about how our users, collectively, use our site. We may share this type of non-personally identifiable, aggregated statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their services as well as Remind. 

##### What this is saying

There is certain information that we gather automatically when you use Remind, such as your IP address and cookie information. Some of this information is collected and used in an aggregate and anonymized way to help improve our service. If Personal Information is included, we treat it carefully like all other Personal Information. 

* * *

#### Mobile application

When users use our mobile application, we automatically collect the IP address, device ID, device type, and what OS the user is running. If you create an account through an SMS invitation, we may ask you for your mobile phone number (even if you have already signed up for the Services some other way such as through your browser). 

We collect users’ IP addresses whenever they use our mobile application, which provides us with a coarse approximation of the user’s location at the city level in order for Remind to, for example: 

  * provide Organizers with a geo-specific long-code (ie, generic phone number with a local area code),
  * support features such as school selection, and
  * enable other internal measurement and Services features.



We also may, with your express consent, request more specific location information in order to provide you with more relevant information (such as nearby classes or relevant groups that you may subscribe to). We will not store or track your device location on an on-going basis or without your permission. We may also collect location-based information from users as part of providing the Services and in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations for the user’s jurisdiction. 

Remind does not automatically collect or store phone numbers of first-time underage users unless he/she has previously used the Services over SMS and we have notified his/her parent; however, if the underage user has properly signed up for the Services through SMS and then downloaded Remind’s mobile application, Remind will have and may use the underage user’s phone number: 

  * to merge the underage user’s accounts,
  * to continue SMS delivery services, and/or
  * as a back-up method of notification.



##### What this is saying

When you use the Remind app, there may be additional information that we collect like your device ID, phone number and approximate location. 

* * *

### Email and text message communications

If you provide us your email address or phone number, Remind may send you administrative messages (such as updates, Notifications, newsletters, and other news) relating to the Services or to respond to communications from you. By maintaining a Remind account and/or not opting out of receiving information from Remind, you acknowledge and agree that you may receive e-mail or text messages on your phone or mobile device from other Remind users, from Remind and/or its agents (as described below) and third parties if you choose to use services or products that they offer. Receiving these messages may cause you to incur usage charges or other fees or costs in accordance with your wireless or data service plan. Any and all such charges, fees, or costs are your sole responsibility. You should consult with your wireless carrier to determine what rates, charges, fees, or costs may apply. We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us if your computer supports this type of program. We only send the communications described above to an underage user upon providing notice to the parent. If you no longer wish to receive administrative email messages from Remind you may opt-out by following the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each message or by emailing us at [contact@remindhq.com](mailto:contact@remindhq.com). Please note that if you do not want to receive legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Policy, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are responsible for reviewing the legal notices for changes. 

To permanently cease receiving SMS text messages, please follow the instructions below: 

  * If you are located in the US or Canada, text STOP, CANCEL, or UNSUBSCRIBE: 

    * in reply to any SMS message from that class/group,
    * to a Remind long-code (a phone number issued by Remind), or
    * in the US, to the Remind short code 81010.
  * To stop receiving messages from a specific class or group, text LEAVE @class or group code to a Remind long-code (a phone number issued by Remind), or in the US, to the Remind short code 81010. 

  * If you are an international user located anywhere outside of the US, please [click here](https://help.remind.com/hc/en-us/articles/202540968-How-do-I-opt-out-of-receiving-messages) to learn how to unsubscribe from receiving messages. 




##### What this is saying

We may send you administrative messages regarding Remind. You can opt out of or unsubscribe from receiving these messages by [clicking here](https://help.remind.com/hc/en-us/articles/202540968-How-do-I-opt-out-of-receiving-messages). 

* * *

### Push notifications

We send notices to you when an Organizer of your class or group has posted something new to your class or group. If you no longer wish to receive such communications, you may turn them off at the device level. If you are a parent of an underage user, you always have the choice to no longer allow your child to receive such communications by contacting us at [contact@remindhq.com](mailto:contact@remindhq.com). Any user may email us at [contact@remindhq.com](mailto:contact@remindhq.com) if such user no longer wishes to receive communications from the Services. 

##### What this is saying

There are different notification options. We may send push notifications to your class; you can always opt out of these. 

* * *

### What about cookies, pixels and local storage?

Cookies are small files that websites place on your computer as you browse the web. Like many websites, Remind uses cookies to discover how people are using our Services and to make them work better. 

A pixel is a small amount of code on a web page or in an email notification. As many services do, we (or our agents) may use pixels to learn whether you’ve interacted with certain of web or email content on our Services. This helps us measure and improve our Services and personalize your experience on Remind. 

Local storage is an industry-standard technology that allows a website or application to store information locally on your computer or mobile device. We use local storage to customize what we show you based on your past interactions with Remind. 

Remind uses these technologies to deliver, measure, and improve our Services in various ways. These uses generally fall into one of the following categories: 

  * #### Authentication and security

    * To log you into Remind. 

    * To protect your security. 

    * To help us detect and fight spam, abuse, and other activities that violate the Remind’s policies. 

For example, these technologies help authenticate your access to Remind and prevent unauthorized parties from accessing your account. 

  * #### Preferences

To remember information about your browser and your preferences. 

For example, cookies may help us remember your preferred language or country that you are in. We can then provide you with Remind content in your preferred language without having to ask you each time you visit Remind. We can also customize content based on your country, such as disabling SMS, or to withhold certain content based on applicable local laws. 

  * #### Analytics and research

To help us improve and understand how people use our Services. 

For example, cookies help us test different versions of our services to see which particular features or content users prefer. We might also optimize and improve your experience on Remind by using cookies to see how you interact with our services, such as when and how often you use them and what links you click on. We may use Google Analytics to assist us with this. 

Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because you will not be able to log in or use many of the Services’ features without cookies enabled. Note that the use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over those cookies. 




##### What this is saying

Cookies are bits of information that tell us you’ve visited Remind before and help the browser remember things about you (such as your language setting). Our cookies do not collect any personal information from you. This only applies to Remind cookies and no one else’s. 

* * *

### Mobile analytics

We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality and improve the performance of our mobile software on your phone. This software may collect, store and use information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. This software may share information it collects with other third parties as part of providing the analytics services and to comply with applicable laws. 

##### What this is saying

When you use the Remind app on your phone or tablet, we have analytics that help us understand how you use the app. This helps us improve the features & design! 

* * *

### What happens when I associate my account with a school or other organization?

Users may have the choice of associating their account with a school or other Organization (such as a team or group). This may be required (for example) for teachers and may be either required or strongly encouraged for other types of Organizers in order to use certain features of the Services. 

By associating your account with an Organization, you acknowledge and agree that a verified Organization administrator, principal, technology specialist, or other party authorized by the school or organization (such as Organizers associated with the same Organization) may be able to view your User Submissions (including your Personal Information and messaging content but not your personal contact information). In addition, verified Organization administrators and Organizers may be able to make administrative changes to your account, such as, adding, removing, or moving you from classes and/or groups, sending messages on your behalf, and more. 

If you are an Organizer affiliated with an Organization, you acknowledge that Remind may enable other users who are associated with the same Organization to contact you -- for example, teachers, students, or parents who are associated with your Organization may communicate with you. Participants may also contact each other (in addition to viewing User Submissions). Remind does not display in a user’s account profile personal contact information of the user to any other users without prior consent. 

##### What this is saying

You may be required to link your account with an Organization. Linking helps to verify your identity and may unlock certain features. If your Organization is managed by a verified administrator, they may also have access to certain information in your Remind account. We will not display your personal contact information to other users without your permission. 

* * *

### Will Remind share any of the personal information it receives?

Remind relies on its users to provide accurate Personal Information in order to provide our Services. We try our best to protect that information and make sure that we are responsible in handling, disclosing, and retaining your data. We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone. If other Remind users or third party products you choose to use have access to your Personal Information (for example, your messaging content), they may use and share that information in ways that Remind cannot, and does not, control. Remind shares your Personal Information in personally identifiable form as described below. 

#### Agents and third party service providers

Advertising is not permitted on the Services. However, we employ other companies to perform tasks on our behalf and help us provide certain features of our Services, and may need to share your information with those companies in order to provide our Services to you. Some examples of services for which we use agents include sending email or SMS, analyzing data, and providing user services. These agents may use Personal Information we share with them, for example, to assist us, to provide their services to you and/or us, and to measure and improve the performance of their services. Please see [here](https://help.remind.com/hc/en-us/articles/203025679-How-is-my-information-used-in-order-for-Remind-to-operate-the-service) for further information about the agents we use as part of the Services (including any of their specific terms or policies that are applicable and that may govern use of your information). You hereby consent to our sharing of information about you (including, in some cases, Personal Information) for such purposes. 

##### What this is saying

Remind does not rent or sell your personal information. We may share your information to provide certain parts of the Remind service, only as provided in this policy. If you have any questions, please reach out to us at [contact@remindhq.com](mailto:contact@remindhq.com). 

* * *

### Business transfers

If Remind (or substantially all of its assets) is acquired by another company, user information may be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by that company. You acknowledge that such a transfer may occur, and that any acquirer of Remind may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on the Services of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personal Information (including the right to delete your information). If Remind goes out of business without a successor, Remind would delete your information. 

##### What this is saying

If Remind is bought by another company, we may need to provide your information to that company. We will be sure to let you know if this ever happens so you can make decisions about your personal information. 

* * *

### Protection of Remind and others

We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to: 

  * comply with the law (for example, responding to a subpoena or other legal process); 
  * enforce or apply our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-service) and other agreements; or 
  * protect the rights, property, or safety of Remind, our employees, our users, or others. This includes, without limitation, exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection or responding to government requests. 



##### What this is saying

We may release your personal information if necessary to protect our community (for example, to comply with legal requests). 

* * *

### With your consent

Except as set forth herein or where Remind determines necessary in order to comply with applicable laws or legal processes, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and you will be given the option to prevent the sharing of this information unless required by law or legal processes. 

##### What this is saying

If there is any other reason we need to share your personal information (other than for legal reasons), we will get your consent first. 

* * *

### Is information about me secure?

If you have created a Remind account, the Personal Information in your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You may help protect against unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account. 

Remind endeavors to protect user information and to ensure that user account information is kept private; however, we cannot guarantee the security of user account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time. For additional information about the security measures we use in connection with the Services, please contact us at [contact@remindhq.com](mailto:contact@remindhq.com). 

When you enter information within the login portion of our site, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). 

The Services contain links to other sites or services. Remind is not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites. When linking to another site you should read the privacy policy stated on that site. This Privacy Policy only governs information collected on the Services. 

##### What this is saying

The security of your personal information is extremely important to us and we take measures internally to make sure your information is safe with us. 

* * *

### Third party services, social media features and widgets

You may be able to access certain third party products through Remind’s Services (such as, a third party payment platform to facilitate your collection and processing of payments). Payment processing services on Remind are provided by Stripe and are subject to the [Stripe Connected Account Agreement](https://stripe.com/connect/account-terms), which includes the [Stripe Terms of Service](https://stripe.com/terms/) (collectively, the “Stripe Services Agreement”). By agreeing to the Agreement, you agree to be bound by the Stripe Services Agreement, as the same may be modified by Stripe from time to time. As a condition of Remind enabling payment processing services through Stripe, you agree to provide Remind with accurate and complete information about you and your entity (if applicable), and you authorize Remind to share it and transaction information related to your use of the payment processing services provided by Stripe. 

Third party products you choose to use on Remind may need to collect and use your Personal Information in order to provide their services to you; in order to use any third party products, you must review and agree to their specific terms and privacy policies. 

Our Services may also include social media features, such as the Facebook “Like” button, and widgets, such as the “Share this” button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Services. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it. 

##### What this is saying

You may choose to use third party products while using Remind. Since these third party products are considered outside of Remind’s core services (and are not covered by our Privacy Policy), you will need to review and agree to their terms before using their products. 

* * *

### What information can I access and modify?

As a Remind account holder, you have access to view and update the following information at your discretion: 

  * information in your user account (such as your email address), 
  * Participant names, 
  * user preferences, 
  * organization (or school) affiliation, and 
  * content in your account (note that once provided, you may not be able to edit or remove certain types of content, such as messages) 



This list may change as the Services change. 

##### What this is saying

You may access and change certain information that you enter into your Remind account. 

* * *

### How do I delete my account?

You can always opt not to disclose information, even though it may be needed to take advantage of certain Remind features. 

You are able to add or update certain information on pages, such as those listed in the “What Information Can I Access” section above. When you update information, however, we often maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records. Certain types of communication you send to other users cannot be removed, such as message content. 

You may request deletion of your Remind account by accessing your account online or emailing [contact@remindhq.com](mailto:contact@remindhq.com). Note, if you are a Participant or Organizer and you request to delete your account, Remind may notify the Organization and the Organizer(s) of the classes and/or groups you are affiliated with of your deletion request. Please note that certain information may remain in our records, server logs and archives after deletion of your account. Remind retains this information for purposes such as diagnosing problems with the service and for auditing legal investigations, but reserves the right to delete this information in accordance with its standard business practices in effect from time to time. Further, information and other content you have provided may remain visible elsewhere to the extent such content was copied or stored by other users. 

For under age users with an account that is inactive for twelve months or more (meaning the account has not received a message through the Services in that time), Remind’s policy is to disable access to Personal Information associated with that account. 

If your or your child’s Personal Information changes, or you no longer desire to use our Services, or you would like to refuse Remind to further contact your child, you may review, correct, update, delete inaccuracies, request deletion of your child’s information, or amend it by logging into your account and making those changes or contacting us at [contact@remindhq.com](mailto:contact@remindhq.com). We will respond to your request as quickly as possible. 

We will retain your or your child’s information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the Services. If you wish to cancel your or your child’s account or request that we no longer use you information to provide Services, contact us at [contact@remindhq.com](mailto:contact@remindhq.com). Note we will retain and use information, for example, to comply with our audit and legal obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce our agreements. 

If the information you are requesting to delete was uploaded or otherwise provided by a verified administrator of an Organization to which you belong (for example, through CSV or SIS integration), then you must request deletion of that information directly from the Organization. Remind may inform the Organizer(s) and/or Organization(s) you are affiliated with when you request to delete your Remind account. 

##### What this is saying

On Remind, you have control over your personal information. As an Organizer or Participant, you may delete your account at any time by logging in online. You also have the option to email us directly at [contact@remindhq.com](mailto:contact@remindhq.com) to delete your account. 

* * *

### Changes to this privacy policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (using the e-mail address specified in your account) or by posting a notice on the Services prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. 

If we make material changes to the types of Personal Information we collect or how we use Personal Information collected from underage users we will notify parents by email in order to obtain verifiable parental consent for the new uses of the child’s Personal Information. 

##### What this is saying

If we update this Privacy Policy, we will let you know! 

* * *

If you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy at Remind or [remind.com](https://web.archive.org/), please send us a detailed message to [contact@remindhq.com](mailto:contact@remindhq.com). We will make every effort to resolve your concerns.
