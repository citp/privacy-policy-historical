# SPECTRUM BRANDS HOLDINGS, INC. PRIVACY POLICY | Remington Products

This privacy policy is effective on August 26, 2011.

This policy describes Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc.’s and its affiliated companies and subsidiaries (collectively “Spectrum”) practices with respect to information it collects and receives from users of this Site, including the types of information collected, how it is used, and with whom it is shared. 

This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect from this Site, and does not apply to any other business activity of Spectrum. By using our site, you consent to the collection, maintenance and use of this information by us. If you do not agree to the terms of this policy and do not consent to the collection, use and maintenance of information as described in this policy, you should leave the Site immediately. 

We reserve the right to revise this policy at any time. When we do, we will give you notice of the revised Privacy Policy by posting the revised Privacy Policy on the Site and by revising the “effective date” at the top of this Privacy Policy. You are responsible for regularly reviewing the current privacy policy. 

**PRIVACY OF CHILDREN**

The Site is a general audience website. We do not intentionally collect personally identifiable information (as defined below) from users of this Site who are under the age of thirteen. If we become aware that a user of our Site is under the age of 13 and has provided information to us (e.g., placed an order, or entered a sweepstakes, contest or other promotion) using our Site, we will remove that child’s personal information from our files. We may use the information to provide notices to the parents of users under the age of 13 where that may be necessary. 

**WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT AND HOW DO WE USE IT?**

We collect and store “personally identifiable information” and “automatic information.”

**Personal Information.** “Personally identifiable information” is information that tells us who you are, such as your first name, your last name, your postal address and zip code, your e-mail address, your telephone number, your hobbies and interests, and/or information regarding your pets and purchases.

We may collect information from you if you register with our site or sign up for our newsletter, purchase products on our site, enter a sweepstakes or contest, submit a rebate or coupon request, or otherwise voluntarily provide the information to us (e.g., via our “Contact Us” web page, or in connection with ratings, reviews, requests for advice, suggestions, testimonials or any user-generated content, such as photographs and/or videos).

You can choose not to provide personally identifiable information to us. However, if you do not provide such information, you will not be able to enter a sweepstakes or contest, and we may not respond to your “Contact Us” inquiry, send our newsletter to you, and/or process your rebate or coupon request.

We may use the personally identifiable information we collect to process a rebate, coupon or other request that has been placed by you, notify you regarding sweepstakes and contests, send our newsletter to you, and/or for marketing Spectrum’s products and services (or those of affiliated companies or marketing partners) via email, postal mail and otherwise.

**Automatic Information.** “Automatic information” is information automatically collected by our web server (which may be hosted by a third-party), or third-party services (such as Google Analytics), that your web browser makes available whenever you visit our Site.

Automatic Information is not generally associated with Personally Identifiable Information but, if it is, the Automatic Information will be treated as Personally Identifiable Information.

We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. This includes HTML "cookies." A “cookie” is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies provide a means for web sites that you visit to keep track of your online patterns and preferences. Among other things, cookies help us identify returning users, and they help us customize our service to a user’s needs. By understanding which areas of the Site a user visits, cookies allow us to present information, products and specials that are of personal interest.

Spectrum may also use Flash cookies, which track a user’s Internet use across websites, and are not deleted or controlled by users in the same manner as standard HTML cookies.

In addition to cookies, for each visitor to the Site, our web server automatically recognizes and/or collects (where possible) certain information, such as your domain name, IP address, type of computer, type of web browser, screen size and characteristics (e.g., color, resolution), and operating system, and the city, state and/or country in which you are located. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer when you connect to the Internet. We may also collect information regarding your Internet browsing history (e.g., the site you visited before accessing our Site, the search engine and search terms that you used, and information about your previous visits to our Site), the length of your visit, the pages you viewed, your Internet service provider, the language settings on your computer, and certain software (e.g., Java support).

We may use such information for purposes of system administration, to improve the design and content of the Site, and/or to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use such information in the aggregate to analyze Site usage and/or to assess the traffic to the Site.

**HOW DO WE SHARE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT?**

We may transfer and otherwise disclose your personally identifiable information and automatic information to third parties that either are subject to this Privacy Policy or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Policy.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we may transfer or otherwise disclose such information to third parties (a) for their marketing purposes, (b) that perform services on behalf of Spectrum, (c) in connection with the sale or purchase of subsidiaries or business units or the sale of Spectrum’s assets, (d) to conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process, (e) to protect and defend the rights or property of Spectrum or its affiliated companies, (f) to identify, contact and/or bring legal action against someone who may have breached our Terms of Use, and/or (g) to act to protect the interests of our site, users or others.

**IS THE INFORMATION COLLECTED SECURE?**

Information transmitted on the Internet and/or stored on systems attached to the Internet is not 100% secure. As a result, we do not ensure, warrant or guarantee the security or integrity of such information. We will not be responsible for disclosure of any information due to errors in transmission or the unauthorized acts of third parties.

**Links to Other Websites**

While you are using this Site, you may be linked or directed to other third party sites outside of the Site that are beyond our control. Each of these third party sites may have a privacy policy different from ours. For example, you might click on a link or banner ad that will take you off the Site. These links and banners may take you to sites of advertisers, sponsors and co-branding partners. Please review the privacy policies of these sites. We are not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.
