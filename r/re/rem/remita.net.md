## 5.0 Cookies

Cookies are small files placed on your computer's hard drive that enables the website to identify your computer as you view different pages. Cookies allow websites and applications to store your preferences in order to present contents, options or functions that are specific to you. Like most interactive websites, and online platforms, Remita uses cookies to enable the tracking of your activity for the duration of a session. Our platform uses only encrypted session cookies which are erased either after a predefined timeout period or once the user logs out of the platform and closes the browser. Session cookies do not collect information from the user's computer. They will typically store information in the form of a session identification that does not personally identify the user. 

We do not have access or control over the cookies of our partners, affiliates, and service providers. We are therefore not responsible for their use of cookies.

## 6.0 How we protect your personal information

We store and process your personal information on our computers in Nigeria, Africa and elsewhere in the world where our facilities are located. We protect your information using physical, technical, and administrative security measures to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure and alteration. Some of the safeguards we use are firewalls and data encryption, physical access controls to our data centers, and information access authorization controls.

## 7.0 How We Share your information with other Relevant Parties

During your transaction, we may provide the corresponding party with information such as your name, account identification details, contact details, shipping and billing address, or other information needed to promote the integrity and security of the transaction. We may also provide details of unsuccessful transactions. 

We work with third parties, including merchants, to enable them to accept or send payments from or to you, using Remita. In doing so, a third party may share information about you with us, such as your email address or mobile phone number, to inform you that a payment has been sent to you or when you attempt to pay a merchant or third party. We use this information to confirm that you are a Remita customer and that Remita as a payment and collection platform can be enabled. We also validate your status as a Remita customer to third parties on your instruction. 

You accept that your pictures and testimonials on all social media platforms about Remita can be used for limited promotional purposes by SystemSpecs or its agents. This does not include your trademark or copyright protected materials.

Where your employee, as part of the process of application for a service from SystemSpecs or a third party, requires his/her data to be provided in support of such an application to SystemSpecs or a third party, SystemSpecs is obligated to avail such request, upon the employee giving the requisite authorisation as the Data Owner, in the form prescribed by SystemSpecs or the third party. 

From time to time we may send you relevant information such as product updates, new functionalities, tips on how to use the platform and new service offerings.

We may also share your personal information in compliance with local or international regulatory requirements, with fraud prevention and risk management agencies with our service providers or in compliance with a court order. 

## 8.0 Security

We will always hold your information securely. To prevent unauthorized access to your information, we have implemented controls and security safeguards at technical and operational levels. This site uses Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) to ensure secure transmission of your personal data. You should see the padlock symbol in your URL address bar once you are successfully logged into the platform. The URL address will also start with https:// depicting a secure webpage. SSL applies encryption between two points such as your PC and the connecting server. Any data transmitted during the session will be encrypted before transmission and decrypted at the receiving end. This is to ensure that data cannot be read during transmission.

## 9.0 Data Confidentiality Rights
