Personal Information MediZine Collects From You

**

If you are receiving MediZine publications and promotional email messages, this is due to your having returned a business reply card to MediZine upon which you included certain Personal Information (defined below) and indicated your interest in receiving such communications.  For purposes of this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" shall mean information that can be used to identify you, including, but not limited to: (a) a first and last name; (b) a home or other physical address, including street name and name of city or town; (c) an e-mail address; or (d) a telephone number.

**How MediZine Uses Personal Information**

MediZine may use your Personal Information to send email communications to you, including email communications sent on behalf of its advertisers and other partners.  If you indicated your interest in receiving health or medical information from third parties, then MediZine may share your Personal Information with such third parties.  MediZine does not share your Personal Information with any third parties other than as specifically stated in this Privacy Policy.  MediZine may use your Personal Information for internal business purposes, such as performing market analysis and analyzing and managing its business.

MediZine may provide subscriber information in aggregate, de-identified form (i.e., in a manner that the data cannot be traced back to you) to its advertisers and other parties. 

MediZine may, in its sole discretion, share or transfer your Personal Data where permitted or required by law, to comply with legal process (for example, MediZine may disclose your information as necessary to comply with an authorized civil, criminal or regulatory investigation), to protect the security or integrity of its databases or the Website, to protect MediZine’s business or reputation, to take precautions against legal liability, in the event of a business transition (see below), to protect and defend the rights or property of MediZine, for required institutional risk control, or for resolving disputes, inquiries or complaints with respect to your use of the Website.

MediZine may also employ other companies and individuals to perform certain functions on its behalf. Examples include sending direct and electronic mail, information technology support, maintaining and removing duplicate information from user lists, analyzing data and providing marketing analysis. The agents performing these limited functions on MediZine’s behalf shall have access to its users’ Personal Information as needed to perform their functions for MediZine but are not permitted to use your Personal Information for other purposes.  All MediZine contractors operate under federal and state laws regarding consumer privacy.

Business Transitions

In the event MediZine goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your Personal Data might be among the assets transferred.

MediZine may use the information stored in its database: (i) to effectuate the purpose or transaction for which the information was originally provided by a user; (ii) to pre-populate information fields in the event a user wishes to purchase products and/or services or sign up for and/or subscribe to services, promotions or other offers in the future; (iii) to ensure that a user will not be repeatedly exposed to the same advertisements, offers and/or promotions while visiting the Website; and/or (iv) to, in connection with regular communication with a user, include offers, promotions or advertisements that were historically, or are likely to be, of interest to that user.
