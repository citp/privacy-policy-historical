# Remodelista Privacy Policy | Remodelista

**Principles of the Remodelista Privacy Policy**  
* We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.  
* We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, to provide a service you have requested, or to protect our rights.  
* We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.

**What This Privacy Policy Covers**  
* This privacy policy governs the use of the Remodelista web site at http://remodelista.com/  
* It covers how Remodelista treats personal information — that is, personally identifiable information like your name, address, email address, or phone number.

**General Information**  
* Remodelista collects personal information when you post a comment on Remodelista, or register for its email list.  
* When you register or post a comment, we ask for your email address.  
* Remodelista receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, and the page you request in order to operate the Remodelista service.  
* Remodelista uses Google Analytics to view aggregate statistics about the usage of the Remodelista service.

**IP Addresses**  
IP Addresses are automatically reported by your browser each time you view a web page. IP addresses may be used for various purposes, including:  
* To diagnose or service technology problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web company or ISP.  
* To estimate the total number of users visiting Remodelista from specific geographical regions.  
* To make sure that people are not voting for themselves or friends during contests or promotions.

**Cookies**  
* Remodelista may let other companies (such as Performics or Commission Junction) that show advertisements on some of our pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other entities’ use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other entities do not have access to Remodelista’s cookies.

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**  
* Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose online (on message boards, in reviews and discussion areas, and within your public profile page, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others. Your account name (not your email address) is displayed to other users when you post comments or send messages on Remodelista and other users can contact you through messages and comments. Any content that you submit to Remodelista may be redistributed through the Internet and other media channels, and may be viewed by the general public.  
* We do not use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send marketing messages unless you’ve opted in to receive such messages. We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major Remodelista Site changes or for customer service purposes).  
* We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous user usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of Remodelista and to create new features, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing user preferences and trends.  
* When you post a comment or message, or engage in other public activities on the Remodelista service, your Remodelista ID or alias that you are posting under is visible to other users.  
* If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Remodelista does not rent or sell your personal information.  
* Remodelista will not share personal information about you with other people or other companies without your consent except to provide products or services you’ve requested and in the following circumstances:  
* Remodelista may be required to disclose personally identifiable information under special circumstances, such as to comply with subpoenas, warrants, court orders or legal process or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;  
* It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities, including without limitation, fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Remodelista’s terms of use, or as otherwise permitted or required by law. We will transfer information about you if Remodelista is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Remodelista will notify you by email or by putting a prominent notice on the Remodelista web site before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. Remodelista may share demographic information with business partners, such as “53% of users who regularly user Remodelista chat are between 18 and 24″ or the like. No personally identifiable information will ever be used without your permission (e.g. we will ask you for a quote or testimonial)  
* We may release personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law) or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant.  
* Remodelista also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that Remodelista believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Member Agreement, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our web site, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Remodelista, our users or others.  
**  
Editing and Deleting Account Information**  
* You can change your Remodelista member name and other account information, at any time.  
* We may send you certain communications relating to the Remodelista service, such as service announcements and administrative messages, that are considered part of your Remodelista account.  
* You can delete your Remodelista account at any time from your account page; however, please note that your identification, billing and contact information may remain in Remodelista’s records for some period.  
* We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.

**Data Security and Change of Control**  
Remodelista uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Remodelista and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Remodelista makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

If Remodelista learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Remodelista may post a notice on the Remodelista Site if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us using by sending e-mail to feedback@remodelista.com.

In the event that Remodelista is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from our Users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors’ rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used.
