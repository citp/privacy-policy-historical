<p><span>Improvement Experts takes its responsibilities about customer information and customer service very seriously. Improvement Experts has adopted the following Do Not Call Policy.</span></p>
<p><span>No employee or agent of Improvement Experts shall engage in telemarketing practices that violate the terms of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, the FTC Telephone Sales Rule, or state regulation.</span></p>
<p><span>IE maintains a record of the name and telephone number for consumers who do not wish to be called. If you don't want to receive sales calls from IE, just ask us to place your name on our Do Not Call List. We will note your request immediately, and will remove your information from active lists within 30 days.</span></p>
<p><span>You can make your request by phone by calling </span><span>1-877-754-1290</span><span>. When you make a request you must include your name, address and telephone number(s) you want to be included on our list. If your information changes, please notify us of the new name, address, and telephone number(s) in order to remain on our Do Not Call List. If you would like us to remove you from our Do Not Call List in order to receive our telephone solicitations, notify us by contacting us at the telephone number.</span></p>
<p><span>Please note that Improvement Experts' Do Not Call Policy does not include independent third parties, so you may continue to receive calls from other companies. If you would like to add your number to the National Do Not Call List, you may call </span><span>1-888-382-1222</span><span>, or visit www.donotcall.gov.</span></p>
<p><span>Also note that being on the Improvement Experts' Do Not Call List restricts telephone solicitations only. We may still contact you about other topics.</span></p>
<p><span>All Improvement Experts personnel involved with telemarketing and/or telephone solicitation for Improvement Experts are trained, informed, and directed to comply with Improvement Experts' Do Not Call Policy.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Thank you for your interest in our Privacy and Do Not Call Policies.</span></strong></p>
