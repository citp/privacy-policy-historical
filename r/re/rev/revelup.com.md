## Revel Systems, Inc. Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: May 24, 2018**

This Privacy Policy applies to all products and services offered by Revel Systems, Inc., and our affiliates (collectively “Revel”, “we”, “us” or “our”), including our websites, products, services, mobile and software applications we own or control (the “Services”).

Our Privacy Policy does not apply to products or services offered by other companies or individuals, such as ** ** payment processing services, hardware, third-party software, or ISP services that customers may use in connection with the Services, including such third-party products or services that a customer may lease or procure through Revel. **  **Our Privacy Policy also does not apply to data that we process as a service provider on behalf of our customers, as our handling of this data is governed by the contract with our customer.

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what data we collect, why we collect it and what we do with it.

### HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION

### INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE

We collect information you provide when you access or participate in certain aspects of our Services, such as when you create any type of account, use our Services, make purchases, leave a review, download one of our mobile applications, complete a survey, or enter contests or other promotions. The information you provide may specifically identify you (“Personal Information”), and includes: your name, email address, postal mailing address, business address, and telephone numbers. We also may use a third-party payment service to collect payment information to process your transactions with us. The amount and type of information you provide depends on the nature of the interaction. We may need to collect and process these types of Personal Information in order to provide requested services to you, or because we are legally required to do so. You may always refuse to supply Personal Information, with the caveat that it may prevent you from using our corresponding Services.

We may receive your Personal Information from other sources, such as public databases, joint marketing partners, social media platforms (including from people with whom you are friends or otherwise connected) and from other third parties.

### INFORMATION AUTOMATICALLY COLLECTED BY USING OR ACCESSING OUR SERVICES

When you access, use or interact with our Services, we collect non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Revel may also collect Personal Information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.

### COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s devices. We use cookies and similar technologies (such as pixel tags) to help us identify and track visitors, their usage of our Services, and their preferences. Revel visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their devices should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using our Services, with the drawback that certain features of our Services may not be available or may not function properly without the aid of cookies. We do not currently respond to browser do-not-track signals.

We use Google Analytics, which uses cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of the Services and report on activities and trends.  This service may also collect information regarding the use of other websites, apps and online resources.  You can learn about Google’s practices by going to www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/, and exercise the opt out provided by Google by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.

We may also request access to certain rights on your devices, such as access to storage or camera, and ability to send push notifications.

### OTHER INFORMATION

We may also collect other information that does not identify or relate to an identified or identifiable individual, such as browser and device information, demographic and other information that does not reveal the individual’s specific identity, and information that has been aggregated in a manner that it no longer reveals an individual’s specific identity.  We may use and disclose such information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.
