[View the Privacy Policy Highlights](https://web.archive.org/web/20120919231226id_/http%3A//revsci.net/privacy-highlights)  |  [View archive version](https://web.archive.org/web/20120919231226id_/http%3A//revsci.net/privacy-archive)

AudienceScience is committed to protecting your privacy. Our technology and the way we use it meets or exceeds all industry standards and legal requirements for protecting your privacy online. This privacy policy applies to all AudienceScience web sites, products and services worldwide that display or link to this notice. The purpose of this privacy policy is to give consumers comprehensive information about the information we collect, how we use that information, and inform you of your choices with respect to the collection and use of data for online behavioral advertising. A shorter version of this policy is available in our [Privacy Policy Highlights document](https://web.archive.org/web/20120919231226id_/http%3A//revsci.net/privacy-highlights). You can also learn more in our [Consumer Guide to Audience Based Advertising](https://web.archive.org/web/20120919231226id_/http%3A//revsci.net/videos/consumer-guide-audience-based-advertising) video.

### About Our Online Behavioral Advertising Services

AudienceScience works with advertisers, publishers and other businesses, to deliver targeted or personalized ads, to consumers. In order to target ads we create and use “audience segments”. These audience segments are based on data that is anonymously collected over time and across the Internet to determine or predict user characteristics, behavior, or preferences. Consumers benefit from receiving more relevant ads. Advertisers and publishers benefit from more effective advertising. 

For example, a consumer that is reading reviews about hybrid cars might be placed into our In-Market Hybrid Car segment. As a result, they might receive ads for Hybrid Cars, rather than ads for trucks or minivans. 

### Personal Information You Provide to Us

We only collect personal information when we are contacted directly by an individual through our web site and they provide that information to us. That information may include name, email address or phone number.

We use this information only to respond to these requests or inquiries. We do not provide this information to third parties.

We do not use this personal information for our online behavioral advertising services.

Anyone who has provided personal contact information through the AudienceScience corporate web site may e-mail AudienceScience at [info@audiencescience.com](mailto:info@audiencescience.com) to update, delete, and/or correct their personal contact information. AudienceScience will respond to such a request within thirty (30) days of the date the request is submitted.

### Non-Personal Information We Collect

For our online behavioral advertising (OBA) services, we collect only non-personally identifiable information. All data collected for those services is anonymous. We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) for use with OBA.

We collect information through the use of common internet technologies, such as cookies and beacons, on the web sites of those companies that participate in our online behavioral advertising services. We do not install software on users' computers or track keystrokes. We may also use third parties cookies or web beacons to collect Non-Personal identifiable information on our or other websites.

**Cookies**  
When you visit a participating web site, AudienceScience places one or more cookies on your computer. Cookies are small text files that can be used by a web site to store information on a users' machine and later retrieve it. We use cookies to store information that can be used to serve ads relevant to your interests. We do not store any personally identifiable information in the cookies. We also use cookies when you opt-out via the industry opt-out page. Should you choose to opt-out, we delete all previously collected information from the cookies, and put new information in the cookie which tells us to stop collecting information from that device.

**Third Party Cookies**  
The use of cookies by our [partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers] is/is not covered by our privacy statement. We do/do not have access or control over these cookies. Our [partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers] use session ID cookies [to make it easier for you to navigate our site, in order for you to use the shopping cart, etc.]

**Web Beacons**  
Web sites and web pages contain links to other web sites. These might be links to images, videos, other web pages, ads or other types of content. We collect data from web sites that place a link to our web servers on their web site. We call this link a beacon. (They are also known as an action tag, clear gif or tracking pixel). A beacon is designed to allow the site owner or a third party to monitor or collect information about a site visitor. The type of information collected might include the IP address of the computer, the web page being viewed, the date/time it was viewed, and user activity on the page. We may use the IP address to infer information, such as geolocation. We do not use the IP address to identify users. We do not collect PII. 

**Data Collection**  
We collect data only from web sites we have a business relationship with. We anonymously collect data over time and across these sites to create usage/behavior/interest-based audience segments. 

We also collect data from third party data providers, which may collect data from online and/or offline data sources, such as demographic, product purchase or registration information. For example, when a consumer signs up for a loyalty card at a retail store, the consumer may agree to allow the retailer to use the purchase data for marketing purposes. The retailer, or a third party they work with, will then repackage the purchasing data of many consumers in a way that it can be used for online marketing. When that data is shared with AudienceScience, any personally identifiable information has been removed. What we receive is a group (audience segment) of anonymous users that are interested in certain products or services, such as cars, electronics, or clothing. We work closely with these data providers to ensure that we don’t receive personally identifiable information when this data is provided to us. 

We contractually require the web sites and data providers we collect data from to follow the OBA principles and practices we adhere to. This includes provides users with a notice on their web site that they collect data and a link to an opt-out.

We provide consumers with a means to opt-out of data collection. To opt-out, please see the “Choices” section below. 

**Sensitive Information**  
AudienceScience does not create nor use any sensitive data segments to tailor ads on behalf of our advertiser clients. However, we recognize that consumers may have differing opinions regarding which data segments are sensitive. In order to provide transparency around potentially sensitive data segments collected and used by AudienceScience, we will provide some examples of them here. For example, we may use health related segments such as Cholesterol and Dental, Oral Care or finance related segments such as Retirement Planners or Real Estate and Mortgage Shoppers.

While we don't consider any of the above data segments to be sensitive, we think its important to provide this transparency to help you have a better idea of which segments might be collected by us, so you can make informed decisions. And we don't use any data segments to determine credit worthiness, for insurance underwriting or similar purposes.

**Children**  
We do not target children under the age of thirteen (13). Children under the age of 13 may be placed into one of our general audience segments, based on the web activity of the computer/browser they are using. We are unable to prevent this as we do not collect personally identifiable information and we don't collect information with the intent of identifying users as being under the age of 13.

### Uses of Non-Personal Information

To make advertising more relevant to you, the audience segments we create are used by us, our clients and partners, including advertisers and publishers, to deliver targeted advertising on the Internet.

In the process of serving an advertisement to a consumer, we, or our partners, may decide to serve an ad based on the audience segment(s) that a particular customer is in, and/or other information we have about the user or site the ad comes from.

The data we collect is also used for reporting purposes, to give our clients more information about the performance of their advertising campaigns, and to improve performance over time.

### Information Sharing

Our OBA services are used by advertisers, publishers and other companies providing online advertising services. We may share aggregated, non-personal information and audience segments with these clients to enable them to deliver targeting advertising. We only share this information with authorized third parties and we require them to follow the same OBA principles and practices we adhere to. When you opt-out of our services, we stop sharing OBA data with these third parties. 

### Information Security and Retention

AudienceScience is committed to protecting the security of the information we collect. We use a variety of technologies and procedures to protect information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. We restrict access to authorized individuals. We conduct regular security audits overseen by independent third parties. While we have taken commercially reasonable efforts to guard information, we cannot guarantee that it will not be disclosed or accessed by accidental circumstances or by the unauthorized acts of others.

Non-PII data collected by AudienceScience for OBA purposes is generally retained for up to 90 days. In some cases, we may retain data for up to two (2) years. As part of these OBA services, we also collect aggregated ad delivery and reporting data. This limited type of aggregated advertising performance data is kept indefinitely.

**Confidentiality**  
AudienceScience keeps all data that it receives from and stores for our clients strictly confidential. We are contractually obligated to maintain such confidentiality and we hold our vendors and subcontractors to the same standards whenever they provide services related to the client's information. We do not permit access to the information except as directed by our clients.
