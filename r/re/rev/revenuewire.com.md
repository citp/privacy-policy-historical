## Information Collection

When you submit information to open an account to either offer your digital download product for sale through the RevenueWire services or you open an account to purchase or promote any products that are being offered by RevenueWire, we may collect personal information including without limitation your name, address, email address, and phone number for the purpose of establishing an account with RevenueWire, the collection of billing information for transaction processing, and recording the transactions when you engage in activities on our web site or through the RevenueWire services. If and when we use a payment processing merchant, we ensure that the same strict privacy criteria are in place.

When creating an account as an Affiliate or Merchant on our site, if you wish to have payments wired to your bank account, we will ask you to submit Bank Account information to us in order to facilitate these payments. The Bank Account information you submit to us is sensitive information and is therefore protected by us using industry-standard SSL Encryption.

From time to time, and provided that we have your consent, we may also send you electronic mail containing information about product updates, new product offerings and other information that may interest you. At any time, you may opt-out of receiving email from us, either by clicking the Unsubscribe link in the applicable email, or by sending an email with your request to privacy@revenuewire.com, and including 'UNSUBSCRIBE' in the subject line.

We respect your privacy and value your trust. We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We will never sell, rent, lease, or give your information to a third party unless required to do so by law.

We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as shipping your order or offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.

We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.

We may also disclose your personal information if RevenueWire is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.

By choosing to enter and submit the requested information when prompted, you are consenting to RevenueWire's collection, use, and disclosure of such information for the purposes as outlined herein.

Any information that you post to a community-based website, personal entry site, chat room, public bulletin, blog or forum is available to all users of that site. RevenueWire cannot control, nor is it responsible for the use, disclosure, or dissemination of such information by any third parties. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at privacy@revenuewire.com. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
