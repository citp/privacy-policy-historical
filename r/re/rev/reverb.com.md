### 1\. Introduction

Reverb.com, LLC, its affiliated companies (“Reverb” or “we” or “us”) and the associated websites were formed to create a community for musicians, collectors, enthusiasts, dealers and the just-plain-curious to gather in a marketplace fully dedicated to buying and selling instruments, gear, equipment and musical recordings.  Therefore, the privacy of all of our members and stakeholders - your privacy - is something we take extremely seriously.  This policy details how we treat the personal information that we collect, what settings we provide for you to control how your information is used on Reverb, and how you can contact us with any questions or concerns. This policy is not a contract between Reverb and its users, but is merely a recitation of Reverb policies.

This policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide when you visit the websites [reverb.com](https://www.reverb.com/), [lp.reverb.com](https://lp.reverb.com/) or any of their affiliated websites (our “Website”) and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information. It also applies to information we collect: (a) in email, text, and other electronic messages between you and this Website; (b) through mobile and desktop applications you download from this Website, which provide dedicated non-browser-based interaction between you and this Website; (c) when you interact with our advertising and applications on third-party websites and services, if those applications or advertising include links to this policy; and (d) through any other sources associated with the Website. 

The policy does not apply to information collected by: (a) us offline; or (b) any third party, including through any application or content (including advertising) that may link to or be accessible from or on the Website. 

Please read this policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. By accessing or using the Website, you expressly agree to this policy. This policy may change from time to time. Your continued use of this Website after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the policy periodically for updates. 

### 2\. Children Under the Age of 18
