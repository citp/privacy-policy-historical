# Reverb Privacy Policy | Reverb

Reverb is built as a community and online listing/auction site for musicians, collectors, enthusiasts, dealers and the just-plain-curious to gather in a marketplace fully dedicated to buying and selling instruments.  Therefore, the privacy of all of our members and stakeholders - your privacy - is something we take extremely seriously.  This policy details how we treat the personal information that we collect, what settings we provide for you to control how your information is used on Reverb, and how you can contact us with any questions or concerns.  This policy explains our privacy practices for Reverb.com and services provided by Reverb.com LLC (â€œReverbâ€).

**Information Collected or Received**

Reverb will not sell or disclose your name, email address or other personal information to third parties without your explicit consent, except as specified in this policy.

In order to create an account with Reverb, you are required to provide a valid email address at registration and choose a username or alias that may represent your identity on Reverb.

Depending on which services you choose to use, Reverb may require additional information, such as a shop name, billing information (including billing address, phone number, credit card information), a mobile telephone number, a physical mailing address, and/or payment information. As a shop owner if you choose to enable direct checkout, Reverb may require information such as your social security number or tax ID, date of birth, bank account information and/or credit card information in order to verify your identity and provide this service to you.

You may optionally choose to provide your full name and other personal information (such as birthday, gender, location) to be publicly displayed in connection to your account and activity.

Your username, Reverb ID or alias is publicly displayed and connected to your Reverb activity. Other people may see your date joined, feedback, ratings, profile information, items listed for sale, shop pages, sold item listings, and comments in community spaces.

For quality control and resolution seeking purposes, Reverb maintains access to all communication between users through offers, orders, and private messaging. 

Reverb automatically receives and records some information from your browser when you visit the site, such as your IP address, cookies and data about which pages you visit on the site through the use of log files provided by our third-party tracking-utility partners. This information helps us analyze and understand how the site works for members and visitors.

Some members or visitors may connect to or register an Reverb account using an external third-party application, such as Facebook. Reverb may receive some data from those connected third-party applications. Connecting your Reverb account to third-party applications or services is optional, and when you connect your account to an external app, you will be given the opportunity to grant permission. You can revoke your permission under your Reverb account settings.

Reverb uses the information described in this policy to provide and improve our services and products, for billing, for identification and authentication purposes, to contact members or interested parties, and for general research and aggregate reporting.  

Reverbâ€™s Terms of Use require all account owners to be at least 18 years of age (or have the permission and supervision of a responsible parent or legal guardian), therefore, this policy does not discuss use of our site or services by minors.  
**  
****Choice & Control** **  
**  
We know members of our community value having control over their own information, and therefore Reverb gives you the choice of providing, editing or removing certain information, as well as choice over how we contact you.

You may change or correct your Reverb account information (except your username) at any time. You may remove certain optional information you no longer wish to be publicly visible, such as your full name.

For various reasons, Reverb may contact you about our services or your activity. Some of these messages are required, service-related messages for members. Other messages are not required, and you can control which optional messages you choose to receive by changing your settings in your account. Learn more in the Messages from Reverb section of this policy.

If you have optionally connected your account to an external, third-party application, such as Facebook, you can remove permission for the app by changing your account settings.

If you no longer wish to use Reverbâ€™s services or receive service-related messages, then you may close your account.  
**  
Messages from Reverb** On occasion, Reverb will send you messages. The default, required form of communication is email. However, we may choose to offer additional ways to reach you, such as through text messaging (SMS) or physical mail.

Some messages from Reverb are service-related and required for members. Examples of service-related messages include, but are not limited to: a welcome/confirmation email when you register your account, notification of an order, or correspondence with Reverbâ€™s support team. These messages are not promotional in nature. You may not opt-out of receiving service-related messages from Reverb, unless you close your account.

As a member, Reverb may also send you messages related to certain features on the site or your activity. Reverb may also send you news or updates about changes to our site or services. By default, members will receive these messages via email, but you may choose to opt-out of getting certain emails under your account settings.

Reverb offers optional email newsletters. You must opt-in or subscribe to begin receiving newsletters, and subscription is available to both members and non-members. Members may subscribe or unsubscribe from optional newsletters under your account settings or by following the instructions contained in the newsletter emails. Non-members may subscribe by providing an email address, which will only be used by Reverb for these newsletters. Non-members may unsubscribe from newsletters by following the instructions contained in the newsletter emails.  
**  
Community** Reverb is both a marketplace and a community. We are continuing to build features such as Forums, Messaging, Feedback, etc. in order to allow our members to communicate with one another.  Please use common sense and good judgement when posting in these community spaces or sharing your personal information with others on Reverb. Be aware that any personal information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by others, or could be used to send you unsolicited messages. Reverb generally does not remove content from community spaces, and your posts may remain public after your account is closed. You are responsible for the personal information you choose to post in community spaces on Reverb.  
**  
Information Sharing & Disclosure**We want to respect your privacy. Reverb will not sell or disclose your name, email address or other personal information to third parties without your explicit consent, except as specified in this policy.

Reverb limits access to your personal information to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.

As part of the buying and selling process, Reverb will share information between the two members involved in the transaction. You may obtain another Reverb member's email address, shipping address, payment information, and/or other information. As described in Reverb's Terms of Use, you have a limited license to use this information only for Reverb-related communications or for Reverb-facilitated transactions. Reverb has not granted you a license to use the information for unsolicited commercial messages. Without express consent from that person, you must not add any Reverb member to your email or physical mailing list.

Reverb may release your personal information to a third-party in order comply with a subpoena or other similar legal procedure, or when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law; prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss; or investigate or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, or violations of Reverb's Terms of Use. We may disclose personally identifiable information to parties in compliance with our Copyright and Intellectual Property Policy, as we in our sole discretion believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity. In such events, Reverb may disclose name, address, country, phone number, email address and company name.

Reverb is or may be affiliated with a variety of businesses and works closely with them. These businesses may offer promotions or sell items or services to you through Reverbâ€™s services. Reverb may also provide services or sell products jointly with affiliated businesses. Due to the nature of our business model, when an affiliated business is associated with your transaction, we may share information that is related to such transaction with that affiliated business. Reverb may share aggregated demographic information with business partners.

Reverb employs other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf, and we need to share your information with them to provide products and services to you. Examples include but are not limited to fulfilling orders, processing payments, handling billing disputes and collections, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance and providing customer service. Reverb may partner with third-party services for fraud prevention and/or identity verification.

In some cases, Reverb may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, member information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Reverb will transfer information about you if Reverb is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Reverb will notify you by email or by putting a prominent notice on the site before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

When you a load a page on Reverb that has a social plug-in from a third-party site or service, such as a Like or Send button, you are also loading content from that third-party site. That site may request cookies directly from your browser. These interactions are subject to the privacy policy of the third-party site.

We can only speak for ourselves; this policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that Reverb does not own or control, or individuals that Reverb does not employ or manage. If you provide your information to others on Reverb or throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to the use or disclosure of the information you provide to them. Reverb does not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. Reverb is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of other websites on the Internet, even those linked to or from the Reverb site. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.

Reverb may partner with third-party services who may use various tracking technologies, such as browser cookies or Flash cookies, to provide certain services or features. These technologies allow a partner to recognize your computer each time you visit Reverb, but do not allow access to personally identifiable information from Reverb. Reverb does not have access or control over these third-party technologies, and they are not covered by our privacy statement.  
**  
Security** The security of your personal information is important to us. Your Reverb account information is protected by a password.

No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.  
**  
Data Retention** Reverb will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.  If you no longer want Reverb to use your information to provide you services, you may close your account. Reverb will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
