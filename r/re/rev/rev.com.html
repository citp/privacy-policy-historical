        <p class="muted">This Privacy Policy was last updated on November 8, 2012.</p>

        <h2>Our Policy:</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the web sites (collectively, the <strong>"Site"</strong>) of
            Rev.com, Inc. (
        <strong>"Rev"</strong>, "we", "us" and/or "our").
            This Site is
        operated by Rev and has been created to provide information about our company and translation
            and
        document related services (the "Services") to our users ("you",
            "your"). This
        Privacy Policy sets forth Rev's policy with respect to information, including personally
            identifiable
        data (<strong>"Personal Data"</strong>), and other information that is collected
            from Site visitors
        and users of the Services.</p>

        <h2>Information we collect:</h2>
        <p>When you interact with us through the Site or the Services, we may collect Personal
            Data and other information
        from you, as further described below:</p>
        <p><strong>Personal Data That You Provide Through the Site:</strong> We collect Personal
            Data from you when you
        voluntarily provide such information such as when you register for access to the Services
            (for example, your
        name and mailing address), use certain Services, contact us with inquiries or respond
            to one of our surveys.
        Wherever Rev collects Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy
            Policy.</p>
        <p><strong>By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our
            use of it in accordance with
        this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data, you acknowledge and agree that such
            Personal Data may be
        transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Rev and the authorized
            third
        parties referred to herein located in the United States.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Non-Identifiable Aggregated Data:</strong> When you interact with Rev through
            the Site or
        Services, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such
            information, which is
        collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically
            identify you.
        Rev may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases
            owned and
        maintained by Rev affiliates, agents or service providers. This Site may use such information
            and pool
        it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our
            Site, the number of
        visitors to each page of our Site, the domain names of our visitors' Internet service
            providers, and how our
        users use and interact with the Services. Also, in an ongoing effort to better understand
            and serve the users of
        the Services, Rev often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and
            behavior based on
        the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled
            and analyzed on an
        aggregate basis. Rev may share this non-identifiable and aggregate data with its affiliates,
            agents and
        business partners, but this type of non-identifiable and aggregate information does
            not identify you personally.
        Rev may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our Services to
            current and
        prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.
        </p>
        <p>In operating this Site, we may also use a technology called "cookies."
            A cookie is a piece of
        information that the computer that hosts our Site gives to your browser when you access
            the Site. Our cookies
        help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more
            accurately. For instance,
        our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Site without
            needing to remember and
        then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site. In all cases in which
            we use cookies, we will
        not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will
            find a "help"
        section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive
            notification when you
        are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave
            cookies turned on because
        they allow you to take advantage of some of the Site's features.</p>

        <h2>Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information:</h2>
        <p>Rev uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy
            Policy. If you
        provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection
            with the reason for which
        it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal
            Data you provide to answer
        your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to
            obtain access to the
        Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services
            and to monitor your use of
        such services. Rev and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the "Related Companies")
            may also use
        your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through
            the Site to help us
        improve the content and functionality of the Site, to better understand our users and
            to improve the Services.
        Rev and its Related Companies may use this information to communicate with you regarding
            the Services
        or to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so, each
            marketing
        communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out"
            of receiving future
        marketing communications. Note however that as user of the Service you cannot opt-out
            of some administrative
        communications that are reasonably necessary to the Service, such as billing or service
            notifications. In
        addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future marketing communications
            or you wish to have your
        name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below.</p>
        <p>If Rev intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with
            this Privacy Policy,
        you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal
            Data is
        collected.</p>

        <h2>Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information:</h2>
        <p>Rev is not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information
            to be a vital part
        of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we
            may share your Personal Data
        with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> As we develop our business, we might sell or
                buy businesses or assets.
            In the event of a corporate sale, merger,
            reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred
                assets.</li>
            <li><strong>Related Companies:</strong> We may also share your Personal Data with our
                Related Companies for
            purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.</li>
            <li><strong>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties:</strong> Rev, like many businesses,
                sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples
                of such functions
            include mailing information, maintaining databases, shipping and fulfillment and processing
                payments.
            When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide
                them with the
            information that they need to perform their
            specific function.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> Rev may disclose your Personal Data if required
                to do so by
            law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal
                obligation, (ii)
            protect and defend the rights or property of Rev, (iii) act in urgent circumstances
                to protect the
            personal safety of users of the Site or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Your Choices:</h2>
        <p>You can use the Site without providing any Personal Data. If you choose not to provide
            any Personal Data, you may
        not be able to use certain Services.</p>

        <h2>Exclusions:</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Data collected by Rev other than
            Personal Data
        collected through the Site or Services. This Privacy Policy shall not apply to any unsolicited
            information you
        provide to Rev through this Site or through any other means. This includes, but is not
            limited to,
        information posted to any public areas of the Site, such as bulletin boards (collectively,
            "Public Areas"), any ideas for new products or modifications to existing
            products, and other
        unsolicited submissions (collectively, "Unsolicited Information"). All Unsolicited
            Information shall
        be deemed to be non-confidential and Rev shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose,
            distribute and
        exploit such Unsolicited Information without limitation or attribution.</p>

        <h2>Children:</h2>
        <p>Rev does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 13. If
            you are under the
        age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Data through the Site. We encourage parents
            and legal guardians to
        monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing
            their children
        never to provide Personal Data on this Site without their permission. If you have reason
            to believe that a
        child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Data to Rev through this Site, please
            contact us, and
        we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.</p>

        <h2>Links to Other Web Sites:</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the Site. This Site may contain links to other
            web sites not operated or
        controlled by Rev (the "Third Party Sites"). The policies and procedures we
            described here
        do not apply to the Third Party Sites. The links from this Site do not imply that Rev
            endorses or has
        reviewed the Third Party Sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information
            on their privacy
        policies.</p>

        <h2>Security:</h2>
        <p>Rev takes reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data provided via the Site from
            loss, misuse, and
        unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet, email
            or other electronic
        transmission is ever fully secure or error free, so you should take special care in
            deciding what information
        you send to us in this way.</p>

        <h2>Other Terms and Conditions:</h2>
        <p>Your access to and use of this Site is subject to our Terms of Service located at:
            <a href="/about/terms">/about/terms</a></p>

        <h2>Changes to Rev's Privacy Policy:</h2>
        <p>The Site and our business may change from time to time. As a result, at times it
            may be necessary for
        Rev to make changes to this Privacy Policy.
        Rev reserves the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time and from
            time to time
        without prior notice. Please review this policy periodically, and especially before
            you provide any Personal
        Data. This Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated above. Your continued
            use of
        the Site after any changes or revisions to this Privacy Policy shall indicate your agreement
            with the terms of
        such revised Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>Access to Information; Contacting Rev:</h2>
        <p>To keep your Personal Data accurate, current, and complete, please contact us as
            specified below. We will take
        reasonable steps to update or correct Personal Data in our possession that you have
            previously submitted via
