# Legal | RevolverMaps - Free 3D Visitor Maps

## Privacy Policy

This privacy policy has been created to point out how the company (Karma Implementor) running this web content protects the privacy of it's users. The following sections describe how and for what purpose data of users of this website on the one hand and data of users of the widget service one the other hand is processed and used. 

### 1\. Person in Charge

Responsible for data processing on this website is Karma Implementor, c/o: Daniel Seifert, Straße der Nationen 12, 09111 Chemnitz, Germany, email: contact@revolvermaps.com, phone: +49 371 233 80 316. 

### 2\. General Information

  * The services hosted by revolvermaps.com do not require a registration. 
  * The services hosted by revolvermaps.com are free of charge. 
  * No non-public data collected by the revolvermaps.com servers is shared with third parties. Data processing and data storage are limited to the purpose of providing the services described in this document. 
  * Privacy information on client side third party advertising integration is available in section 9.3 below. 



### 3\. Servers

The RevolverMaps servers are located in Frankfurt, Germany. 

A basic principle at revolvermaps.com is to keep the server configuration secure while running the minimum of required software and services. 

### 4\. IP Addresses

In order to communicate over a network a server needs to know the IP address of a client and vice versa. For instance, if your browser requests a file or other resource from a server under the domain revolvermaps.com, the IP address of your internet connection must be transmitted to this server due to the nature of the underlying [TCP/IP protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol). 

#### 4.1 Processing and Storage of IP Addresses

All RevolverMaps servers treat IP addresses as a transient information processed in volatile memory only. Any nonvolatile storage like the logging of IP addresses is deactivated on all revolvermaps.com servers by default. Logging of IP addresses may be activated temporarily when it's neccessary for debugging purposes or when it's required to keep a stable and secure server operation for instance. In such cases IP addresses will be deleted as soon as they are no longer required. This occasional logging of IP addresses is for purposes of legitimate interests in accordance with Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. 

#### 4.2 Geolocation and Anonymized IP Addresses for Geolocation

Geolocation is performed on a city level. For RevolverMaps it is technically impossible to gain more accurate position data (like street names and house numbers) due to the method of geolocation and the available data: 

For the determination of the location of a connected client (see widget service) it's anonymized internet IP address is matched against a local database on a RevolverMaps server. The result is an estimation. Furthermore only the first 3 octets of an IPv4 address are used for the geolocation, the last octet is stripped. This practice lowers the precision of the geolocation additionally. Being transformed to a location information on a city level in this way, the result cannot be used to identify a person or an internet connection. The described data processing is required for the delivery of the RevolverMaps service and is for purposes of legitimate interests in accordance with Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. 

IPv6 geolocation is currently not supported by RevolverMaps. 

### 5\. Log Files

If a file is requested from a RevolverMaps server, the following information may be stored for 7 days: 

  * Time and date of the request 
  * The requested file / resource 
  * The HTTP statuscode (OK, NOT FOUND etc.) 
  * The amount of data being transfered 
  * The HTTP referer (the source from which you came to this website) if available and as available. The availability depends on browser settings, metadata (configuration) of the referring website and other factors. 
  * The user-agent string carrying information about your web browser like the name and version of your browser 
  * Information about your operating system like it's name and it's version 



The logged information can be used by Karma Implementor for debugging purposes, internal statistics, quality assurance but will not be published or shared. 

### 6\. Security / HTTPS

The whole RevolverMaps website is accessible through TLS secured connections (HTTPS). Using the world wide web you should generally prefer secure connections over unsecured connections. This ensures that you are connected to the authorized server and avoids data manipulation and data skimming on the route between your client (e.g. your browser) and the server.

RevolverMaps is currently enabled on this website.

#### 9.6 External Links

This website is configured to reduce the HTTP referrer information to the origin portion (https://www.revolvermaps.com or http://www.revolvermaps.com). When you click on a link to an internal or external site this information may be sent to the target host but not the complete URL. This applies to the use of modern browsers. 

### 10\. Widget Service and Public Statistics

#### 10.1 Description

RevolverMaps provides visitor map widgets for the use on websites. The widgets show the locations of visitors of a website using the service. The determination of the location bases on anonymized IP addresses as described under 4.2. (Geolocation and Anonymized IP Addresses for Geolocation). Every widget contains a link to a public statistics page at www.revolvermaps.com. This page exists to provide more detailed information coming along with better accessibility. 

#### 10.2 Installation and Functional Principle

In order to make use of the widget service the administrator of a website installs a piece of code which requests the resources that are required for the correct function of the service every time the page is being loaded by a user. These resources are for instance JavaScript programs, images and location data to be displayed by a particular widget. 

The widget code is freely available without the need of submitting personal data. An unique token (a combination of digits and letters) is installed with the widget code. This token is used to associate visitor data with a particular website. 

In addition to the loading of resources the client side code sends a request that is used to register the client and to perform the geolocation as described. The result of the geolocation is stored in a database and is displayed by widgets and on the live statistics page. 

#### 10.3 Data

The following data is stored and visible to everyone. Please note that the storage of per location data is limited to one data record in an area of 40km². When new data is available for such a cell, the old data will be replaced: 

**Per location data:**

  * The coordinates, rounded to grid cells of 40km²; used to draw location markers 
  * The location name (city, region, country) 
  * The time and date of the request 
  * The total number of visits per location, aggregated for all users 



**Aggregated data (not coupled with location data):**

  * The total number of visits, aggregated for all users 



In addition the URL of the website containing a widget is sent to RevolverMaps and stored privately on the RevolverMaps servers for 1 hour. This data can be used internally for debugging purposes and abuse prevention and is never published or shared. This data collection happens for the purposes of legitimate interests in accordance with Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. 

Data exchange is limited to the client browser executing widget code and RevolverMaps servers. The protocol of the user website is also used for connections to the RevolverMaps servers. Thus users of the service are encouraged to secure their websites with TLS to secure these connections. 

**It is important to state that:**

  * As long as the website using the service does not leak sensitive information (for instance as part of it's URLs), the RevolverMaps service is technically incapable of identifying users as persons. RevolverMaps has no access to data that would be required and does not collect such data. 
  * The RevolverMaps service is free of cookies and does not track users across websites. The system is not designed to identify users by unique id's from cookies or other storage technics. 



#### 10.4 Data Protection Notice

Users have to disclose the use of the widget service in their privacy policy. The user is responsible for the correct content of the notice. It is recommended to specify the purpose of the use and the data being collected and processed (see this document). It is furthermore recommended to provide a link to this document:

#### 10.5 Opt-out

As a user of the widget service you may want to implement an opt-out button on your website. Here is a sample implementation, you can add it for example to your privacy policy. The code can be modified to fit your needs: 

**1\. The code for the opt-out button:**

**2\. Additionally you have to modify your widget code**

Place your widget code _INSIDE_ the single quotes ( _var code=' <script>...</script>'_ )! The variable _alternative_ can be a message to be displayed if the user has opted out the service. Additionally it could link to your opt-out button:
