Other personal information you provide Revolvy is voluntary and may include your full name, profile image, your country, your language, your location, an alternative email address, your birthday, and information you choose to publicly share with others on the site. If you choose, you can link your social media accounts (Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Pinterest, Instagram, Google+) and your website URL.

2\. Cookies and Tracking Technologies. We may automatically collected information through the use of cookies or other technology to make a user's experience better. For example, cookies enable users to not have to re-enter their user name and password information during a visit or on subsequent visits. We may also use collected information to provide customized advertisements, content, and information; monitor and analyze the effectiveness of Revolvy's and third-party marketing activities; and monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed.

Our third-party providers may also use cookies, web beacons and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and information you may have searched and viewed, or on which of the advertisements displayed on Revolvy you may have clicked. This Policy does not cover the privacy practices of any advertisers or ad servers.

3\. Passively or Automatically-Collected Information. We may automatically record certain information from a user's device by using various types of technology, including cookies. This information may include things like IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites visited just before or just after using Revolvy, the pages or other content the user views or interacts with on Revolvy, and the dates and times of the visit, access, or use of Revolvy. We also may use these technologies to determine a user's interaction with email messages, such as whether a user opens, clicks on, or forwards a message.

4\. Geo-location Information. If you are accessing Revolvy from a mobile device or through a mobile application, your geo-location information may be available for us to see to enable personalization of your experience. You may be able to turn off such data collection by accessing the privacy settings of your mobile device.

## II. How Collected Information Is Used

1\. Operations and Improvements. Personal Information you submit to us is used to provide you access to Revolvy, to improve Revolvy, to better tailor the features and performance of Revolvy, and to offer you additional information, opportunities, promotions and functionality from us, our partners or our advertisers. Additionally, information that you have voluntarily provided to us (such as topics you create, comments you make, media you attach to topics, folders in which you save topics) are used (with other users' information) as part of the community-sharing environment of the site, and is publicly viewable by all Revolvy users.

2\. Communications. At times, we may contact a user via email or phone, if that's available, for administrative purposes. This may include customer service, to address intellectual property infringement, right of privacy violations or defamation issues related to the data posted on Revolvy or with updates relating to products and services offered by us and by third parties we work with. We may also use and display your full name and email address when you send an email notification to a friend through Revolvy or the social network from which you have connected to Revolvy.

## VI. Minors and Children’s Privacy

If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under 18 years of age has obtained a Revolvy account, then you may alert us at [support@revolvy.com](mailto:support@revolvy.com) and request that we delete that child’s information from our servers.

## Data Security

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. We maintain appropriate administrative and technical safeguards to protect personal data including firewalls, password protection and other access and authentication controls. We use SSL technology to encrypt data during transmission.

Although we may allow you to adjust your privacy settings to limit access to certain information, please be aware that no security measures, or method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or store on Revolvy, and you do so at your own risk.

Further, we cannot guarantee that information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your information. Additionally, even after information posted on Revolvy is removed, caching and archiving services may have saved that information, and other users or third parties may have copied or stored the information available on Revolvy. We cannot and do not guarantee that information you post on Revolvy will not be viewed by unauthorized persons.
