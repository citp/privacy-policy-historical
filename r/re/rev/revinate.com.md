# Revinate - Privacy Policy

Revinate, Inc. (“Revinate,” “we,” or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy. We have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe to you our practices regarding the Personal Data (as defined below) we collect from users of the Revinate site available at www.revinate.com (the “Site”) and the services we provide through the Site (collectively, the “Service”). Any capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy will have the meanings set forth in the [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/terms) (“Agreement”). 

By submitting Personal Data through the Service or Site or registering for the Service, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the processing of your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Your Personal Data may be processed in the country where it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of Personal Data may be less stringent than the laws in your country. We do not intentionally gather Personal Data about visitors who are under the age of 13. 

  
**1\. Types of Data We Collect**  
We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data from you when you use the Service, visit the Site, and/or when you send us communications. “Personal Data” means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data. “Anonymous Data” means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data; Anonymous Data, by itself, does not permit the identification of individual persons. We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below. 

  
**1.1 Data You Provide to Us.** We receive and store any information you enter on the Service or Site or otherwise provide to us. For example, but without limitation: 

  * We collect Personal Data from you, such as your user name, password, first and last name, title, company name, e-mail address, telephone number, and postal address, when you create a Master Account or User Account. 
  * We collect your credit card billing information if you make payments directly to us for the Service. We may offer you the ability to use a third party service to make payments to us, in which case any Personal Data you submit to such service will be subject to its terms of use and privacy policy. Any such service is not under our control, and we are not responsible for such service.
  * If you contact us by e-mail or through a form on the Site, we may collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail or that you submit to us.



  
**1.2 Data Collected Through Technology.** We collect information about you based on or through your use of the Service or the Site. 

  * Our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information related to your use of the Service or Site, such as browser type and version, operating system, platform, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and a date/time stamp for your visit. 
  * We may use cookies and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) on our Service or Site to gather information about your online activities relating to the Service or Site, such as the date and time of your visit, the information for which you searched and which you viewed, and the sites you visited before and after visiting our Service or Site. We may also use a cookie to save your settings and to provide customizable and personalized services (such as to hold your Master Account or User Account information). A “cookie” is a small data file placed on your hard drive when you visit certain websites. You may disable cookies by adjusting the preferences settings of your browser. Consult the “Help” feature of your browser for specific instructions. Our advertisers and partners may also use their own cookies. We do not control use of these cookies used by advertisers and partners and expressly disclaim responsibility for information collected through them. 
  * We may use software tools such as Flash or JavaScript on the Service or Site to collect page interaction information such as clicks, drags, and hover-overs, response times, errors, and length of visits to certain pages.
  * We may use clear gifs (otherwise known as web bugs or web beacons) to gather information about your visit to the Service or Site, such as what you click on and pages and information you viewed. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are placed on a user’s hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages. Additionally, be aware that advertisers and partners may also use their own clear gifs, and we do not control use of these by advertisers and partners and expressly disclaim responsibility for information collected through them. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are placed on a user’s hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages.
  * We may use third party services, such as, but not limited, to Google Analytics, to gather information about your visit to the Service or Site, such as the pages and information you viewed. Some of these services provide lead generation services and may gather information about the domain name from which you are visiting the Service or Site.



  
**1.3 Information You Choose to Share with Others.** The Service may contain features that allow you to e-mail hotel reviews from third party sites to other persons and/or to collaborate on the Service with other Authorized Users (for example, through the work flow ticketing system). Any Personal Data that you include in such communications will be viewable by the recipient or those you collaborate with, as applicable. You may also link your User Account to Third-Party Services (for example, Twitter, Facebook, and Foursquare). Any content, including any Personal Data, that you choose to publish to a Third-Party Service will be viewable by its users, depending on your settings and/or preferences with that Third-Party Service. Such content is subject to the terms of use and privacy policy for that Third-Party Service. We may collect information about your Third-Party Service usage (for example, measuring the number of tweets you send). 

  
**2\. Use of Your Data**  
In general, your Personal Data that we collect is used to provide you with a customized experience, aid us in serving you better, and to respond to your requests. In addition, we use your Personal Data to: 

  * facilitate the creation of and secure your Master and/or User Account on our network;
  * identify you as a user in our system;
  * provide you the Service;
  * analyze request and usage patterns, diagnose problems with our server and administer our Service and Site;
  * improve the quality of experience and provide you a personalized experience when you use the Service and Site;
  * develop and improve our services; 
  * send you administrative e-mail notifications, such as security or support and maintenance advisories (the e-mails we send may contain code that enables our database to track your usage of the e-mail, such as whether the e-mail was opened and/or what links (if any) were clicked);
  * respond to your inquiries, including as related to employment opportunities or other requests; and
  * send you e-mail messages or postal mail informing you of our products and services and third party products and services we believe may be of interest to you, such as new features and services, special offers, and updated information, and for other marketing purposes for us or other companies.

Examples include credit card processing, sending postal mail or e-mail, storing data, analyzing data, performing quality assurance, providing technical support, providing marketing assistance, verifying identity, and providing customer service. These third parties may have access to your Personal Data only as needed to perform their functions.
  * We may share your Personal Data with any company that acquires our company or our assets. That company will possess the Personal Data collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy. 
  * We may share your Personal Data with our subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control, in which case we will require them to honor this Privacy Policy. 
  * We may disclose your Personal Data if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to: (1) comply with the law or with legal process served on us or to cooperate with any legal investigation; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of us or our users; (3) act in an emergency to protect someone’s safety; or (4) investigate any violation or potential violation of the law, this Privacy Policy, the Agreement, or any other agreements between you and Revinate.
  * We may share your Personal Data if you provide us prior consent to do so.



  
**4\. Use and Disclosure of Anonymous Data.** We will have the right to use, and share with third parties, Anonymous Data for any purpose and in any manner. Anonymous Data includes non-personally identifiable data we create from Personal Data by excluding information that makes such data personally identifiable. 

  
**5\. Your Choices Regarding Your Personal Data**  


  
**5.1 Your Control of the Use of Your Personal Data.** We offer you choices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Data. We may periodically send you free newsletters and emails about new services, products, or other noteworthy news, or that may contain advertisements for third parties. When you receive newsletters or promotional communications from us, you may indicate a preference to stop receiving further communications from us and you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the message you receive, or by contacting us at support@revinate.com. Despite your indicated email preferences, we may send you notices of any updates to our Agreement, Privacy Policy, or other terms for the Service or Site. 

  
**5.2 Changes to Personal Data.** You may change any of your Personal Data in your Master Account or User Account by editing your profile through the Service or by sending us e-mail or postal mail at the address below. You may request deletion of your Personal Data by us by sending us an e-mail or postal mail at the address below, but please note that we may be required (by law or otherwise) to keep this information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements). When we delete any information, it will be deleted from the active database, but may remain in our archives. 

  
**6\. Security.** We have commercially reasonable security measures in place to help protect against loss, misuse and alteration of your Personal Data in our possession. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while Revinate uses reasonable efforts to protect your Personal Data, Revinate cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

  
**7\. Changes.** We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes to the Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting a prominent notice on the Site and/or sending you an e-mail at your primary email address, as specified in your Master Account or User Account. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be effective immediately for new users of our Service or Site; otherwise these changes will be effective upon the earlier of thirty (30) calendar days following our dispatch of an e-mail notice to you or thirty (30) calendar days following our posting of a notice on our Site. You are responsible at all times for updating your Master Account or User Account to provide to us your most current e-mail address. If the last e-mail address that you have provided to us is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you the notice described above, our dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice of the changes described in the notice. Continued use of our Service or Site following notice of such changes shall indicate your acknowledgement of, and agreement to be bound by, such changes. Except as otherwise provided in this Section, no amendment to this Privacy Policy will be valid.
