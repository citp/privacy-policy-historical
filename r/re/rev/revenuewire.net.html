    <h4>Information Collection</h4>
    <p>When you submit information to open an account to either offer your digital download product for sale through the RevenueWire services or you open an account to purchase or promote any products that are being offered by RevenueWire, we may collect personal information including without limitation your name, address, email address, and phone number for the purpose of establishing an account with RevenueWire, the collection of billing information for transaction processing, and recording the transactions when you engage in activities on our web site or through the RevenueWire services. If and when we use a payment processing merchant, we ensure that the same strict privacy criteria are in place. RevenueWire will not collect or store any credit card information.</p>
    <p>When creating an account as an Affiliate or Merchant on our site, if you wish to have payments wired to your bank account, we will ask you to submit Bank Account information to us in order to facilitate these payments. The Bank Account information you submit to us is sensitive information and is therefore protected by us using industry-standard SSL Encryption.</p>
    <p>We also give our users the option of receiving useful product information (such as product updates, new product offerings, or other information that may be of interest to you), via opt-in permission based email. You may opt-out of receiving such email communications from us at any time by clicking the Unsubscribe link in the applicable email, or by sending us an email with your request to privacy@revenuewire.com, and including 'UNSUBSCRIBE' in the subject line. We fully ensure your privacy and value your trust. We will never sell, rent, lease, or give your information to a third party unless required to do so by law.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.</p>
    <p>By choosing to enter and submit the requested information when prompted, you are consenting to RevenueWire's collection, use, and disclosure of such information for the purposes as outlined herein.</p>
    <p>Any information that you post to a community-based website, personal entry site, chat room, public bulletin or forum is available to all users of that site.

This non-personally identifiable information helps RevenueWire in evaluating the functionality of our services in order to identify areas on how we can improve our services to our clients. This information also assists RevenueWire in reporting relevant data on advertisements and sales to all our applicable clients.</p>

    <h4>Cookies</h4>
    <p>Remote cookies are used on the Internet user's computer and the server databases at RevenueWire in order for RevenueWire to store any information collected by users of the RevenueWire services such as Internet users clicking on ad/banner campaigns, viewing a web page, or purchasing a product.

RevenueWire's usage of cookies does not in any way collect any personally identifiable information.</p>
    <h4>Links</h4>
    <p>We may offer links from our website to other third party websites which may be hosted by our business partners or by unrelated companies which we think may be of interest to you. Such websites are not governed by this privacy policy and RevenueWire makes no representation or warranties as to their practices for dealing with your personal information. We recommend that you check the privacy policy of any website at the beginning of your visit.</p>
    <h4>Security</h4>
    <p>The personally identifiable information that is collected by RevenueWire is stored in limited access servers. RevenueWire takes reasonable precautions to protect the information that has been collected, and to safeguard the servers where such information is stored.
