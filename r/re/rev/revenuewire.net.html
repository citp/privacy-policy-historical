                <h2>Information Collection</h2>
                <p>When you submit information to open an account to either offer your digital download product for sale through the RevenueWire services or you open an account to purchase or promote any products that are being offered by RevenueWire, we may collect personal information including without limitation your name, address, email address, and phone number for the purpose of establishing an account with RevenueWire, the collection of billing information for transaction processing, and recording the transactions when you engage in activities on our web site or through the RevenueWire services. If and when we use a payment processing merchant, we ensure that the same strict privacy criteria are in place. RevenueWire will not collect or store any credit card information.</p>

                <p>When creating an account as an Affiliate or Merchant on our site, if you wish to have payments wired to your bank account, we will ask you to submit Bank Account information to us in order to facilitate these payments. The Bank Account information you submit to us is sensitive information and is therefore protected by us using industry-standard SSL Encryption.</p>

                <p>We also give our users the option of receiving useful product information (such as product updates, new product offerings, or other information that may be of interest to you), via opt-in permission based email.

                <p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.</p>

                <p>We may also disclose your personal information if RevenueWire is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.</p>
