# Review Australia - Terms and Privacy Overview

**PRIVACY POLICY**

This policy outlines how we manage your personal information and applies to all your dealings with us, on line and otherwise.  This policy is subject to Australian privacy law.

Throughout this policy, we refer to your “personal information” which means information or an opinion which identifies you as an individual or from which your identity can be reasonably ascertained. Your name, home address, email address and home telephone number are examples of personal information.

Any reference to “we”, “us” or “our” is a reference to Review Australia Pty Limited and/or any of our related entities, where the context permits.

  **Why we collect personal information**

We collect personal information when it is reasonably necessary for a business purpose. This includes for the purpose of:

  * providing you with goods or services and any related information;
  * to complete transactions with you or on your behalf;
  * to provide you with offers of interest or benefit to you;
  * to better understand your requirements, preferences and feedback;
  * to improve what we offer;
  * purchasing goods or services from you or your employer;
  * advertising our goods and services to you; and/or
  * generating new insights about our business, goods, services and customers.



**What we collect**

The personal information we collect depends upon what, when, where and why it is collected.

We collect information like your name, contact and/or delivery details, date of birth, occupation, interests, your likes/dislikes, job title, payment details, transaction information and your resume (if you apply for a job).

**When we collect**

We collect most personal information directly from you. For example, you might fill out a form online or in a store, or provide information to us over the phone.

We also collect personal information during our relationship with you. For example, when you:

  * purchase or pre order goods or services, especially when we arrange delivery;
  * join or use one of our loyalty or rewards programs;
  * leave goods for repair, exchange or refund;
  * provide feedback; 
  * join, subscribe or connect to our online communities, accounts and/or other social media providers ;
  * subscribe or consent to receiving information, newsletters and/or direct marketing;
  * apply for a job with us;
  * contact us, including by calling us; or
  * offer or provide goods/services to us.


  * use our websites or apps;



**We collect information that is not personal**

When you engage with us on line or walk into a store, we may collect general information that will not personally identify you, such as:

  * using cookies;
  * Internet browser used;
  * operating system used;
  * date of visit;
  * time of visit;
  * path taken through the site or store; and/or
  * number of visitor to the site or store.



This information provides us with usage data so that we can produce anonymous statistics that we use to analyse and improve our business.

**What we collect using cookies**

Cookies may be used on our websites.  A cookie is a text-only string of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer’s hard disk so that the website can remember who you are. These cookies are known as your "Unique Visitor Cookie" and identify your visit only by a random number (e.g. #12489), the name of the domain from where the cookie has come and the “lifetime” of the cookie.

You can accept or decline our cookies by adjusting the "accept cookies" setting on your browser, however this may affect the functionality of our website on your browser.  For example, you may not be able to personalise features on our website if you decline our cookies.

**What we collect from others**

Other people might give us personal information about you. For example, we might be given your personal information by your employer if they do business with us or by your parent/guardian if you are under 18. 

We may also collect personal information from other companies that are able to disclose it to us, if it’s not practical to collect it from you.  For example, we may obtain your personal information from various trusted sources in social media where you have indicated that you would like to buy our goods or services.

If we have received your personal information from a third party, we will take reasonable steps to make sure you know and consent to us having your personal information.

**Using or disclosing information**

We will use your personal information to meet the purpose for which it was provided and/or within the permission/consent you provided. We will use your information to provide you with our or third party goods or services, marketing materials (including direct marketing) and for use in planning, development and research.

More specific examples of us using your information include:

  * processing your transaction
  * processing and considering your job application
  * addressing any feedback or complaints
  * answering queries
  * developing and marketing products and services
  * conducting research about products, services and our business
  * providing loyalty/reward program information and rewards
  * providing direct marketing emails/mail updates about our goods/services



If you don’t provide us with your information or consent, then we may not be able to do one or more of the above.

We may also disclose your personal information to protect the integrity of our website, goods or services or as authorised or required by or under law.

Please note that we cannot guarantee the privacy of information that is transmitted over the internet.

**Who we share your information with**

We may share your information with other members of our group of companies – The PAS Group. The PAS Group includes companies that run other well known brands including Metalicus, Review, Black Pepper, Marco Polo, Yarra Trail and Breakaway.

We will often need to pass your personal details (eg name and address) to companies that perform part of our service delivery. For example, Australia Post, delivery companies, mail houses and third party fulfilment contractors.  These companies and persons would only get limited access to your personal information to complete their task.

**Overseas based service providers and access to personal information**

We work with overseas based service providers that help us conduct our business. For example, technical support for our marketing initiatives and they do it from countries like Canada, United Kingdom and the USA. They may have access to systems that include your personal information. Without them, we would not be able to provide you value and/or levels of services that you expect from us.

We take reasonable steps to ensure that any overseas recipient of personal information does not breach the Australian privacy principles. 

**Access and correction of information**

If you would like to access, update, correct or decide that you don’t want us to hold any of your personal information, you may do so by, if applicable, logging on to our website and changing your preferences or details, or by emailing/writing to our Privacy Officer (details provided below).

If you do not want to receive direct marketing communications or any communications from us, then simply “opt out”, “unsubscribe” or change your details at our website.

Otherwise, please write to our Privacy Officer.

**Security**

We will take reasonable steps to protect your information from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.

Unfortunately, as no on line data transmission is ever completely secure, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of your personal information. 

  **Links to other sites**

You will be able to access external websites by clicking on links provided on our website or marketing initiatives. Those external websites may not be subject to this policy. We do not monitor these sites and are not responsible for their content. We strongly recommend that you contact or review those external websites directly to ascertain their respective privacy standards.

We are not responsible for the content, policies, practices, security or the privacy obligations of any external websites, including the website to which you will be directed if you make a payment to us online.
