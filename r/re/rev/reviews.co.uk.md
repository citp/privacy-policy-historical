# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy (this "Policy") describes how personal information is collected from users of the Reviews.co.uk website at http://www.reviews.co.uk and how that information is used and disclosed. Information We Collect We collect "personal information" about users of the Site and the Review Service in the normal course of our business. As used in this Policy, "personal information" is information that identifies or is capable of being associated with an identifiable person. Some examples of personal information include a user's name, address, and email address. Personal information does not include aggregate information or de-identified information. "Aggregate information" is information about the use of the Site, such as information collected about Site users, or a category of services or users, from which any personal information has been removed. An example of aggregate information would be a report stating that forty-seven percent of the Site's registered users identify themselves as male. Most of the personal information we receive comes directly from users who register on the Site. The information we request at registration includes, without limitation, name, address, e-mail address, and birth date. We may also collect other types of information during registration or in connection with your other activities on the Site, such as demographic information (including, without limitation, your age, occupation, and income) and information about or contained in postings you make in forums or any other interactive areas of the Site, your answers to surveys, your participation in sweepstakes, contests, games and promotional offers; and in any email request you send us for any reason (such as to request customer service or provide us with comments or feedback). Also, we request your email address when you submit a product or service review using the site.We also automatically collect some information when you use the Site or Review Service. We log your IP address. If you reached the Site by clicking on a link or advertisement on another site, we also log that information. This helps us understand our users' interests and maximize our online exposure. All of this information is collected and used only as aggregate information; that is, it is entered into our database, where we can use it to generate overall reports on our users, but not individual reports that identify you personally. Framed Content The Review Service may be displayed on or through Third Party Sites with the use of inline frames or other framing techniques. We may collect personal information in such framed pages or content located on or provided by Third Party Sites. When you submit personal information to us in this manner, it is treated as personal information under this Policy. The collection and use of personal information by the Third Party Site directly (i.e., outside of the Review Service framed pages) is governed separately by the privacy policy of such site. Cookies 

We may use cookies to identify Site users and to customize their experiences on the Site and Review Service. Unless you provide your email address to us, our cookies contain no personally identifiable information about you. If you have provided your email address to us, however, our cookies may be used to identify you. We use cookies to help us understand how visitors use (and to help us to improve) the Site. You may refuse to accept cookies from us by following the procedures specific to your Web browser. If you do so, your browser may react strangely and you may not be able to use some services on the Site or Review Service.

We cannot, however, guarantee protection of all information against interception, misappropriation, misuse, or alteration, or that your information may be not be disclosed or accessed by accidental circumstances or by the unauthorized acts of others. Furthermore, we have no control over the security of other sites you might visit, interact with or do business with.

Your registration information is accessible online only through the use of a password. To protect the confidentiality of personal information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You are responsible for all uses of the Site by any person using your password. Please advise us immediately if you believe your password has been misused or otherwise misappropriated.
