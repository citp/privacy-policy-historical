<p>For each visitor to our Web site, our Web server automatically recognizes the visitor's IP address.</p>



<p>We collect user-specific information on what pages visitors access or visit. We also collect information volunteered by the visitor, such as survey information and/or site registrations.</p>



<p>The information we collect is used to improve the content of our Web page, used to customize the content and/or layout of our page for each individual visitor, and to provide further information regarding RevUp31 through the form of email communication.</p>



<div class="policyCheckItem">

  <h3>With respect to email</h3>

  <p>The only way a visitor will be added to our email distribution list is by voluntarily entering their contact information in one of our site registration forms. We have in place a "Verified Double Opt-In" policy whereby all registrations are confirmed by means of return email. In the case where a registration is not confirmed, the unconfirmed registrations will only receive periodic emails reminding the visitor of their need to verify their registration, otherwise, if the confirmation of registration is received, they are considered a "confirmed" recipient.</p>



  <p>If a visitor does not want to receive e-mail from us in the future, they simply need to click the unsubscribe link found in just one of the emails that they have received from us. Additionally they can let us know by sending an e-mail to the above address or writing to us at the above address.</p>

<div class="policyCheckItem">

  <h3>With respect to security</h3>

  <p> We take precaution to protect our Subscribers and Members information. When Subscribers and Members submit sensitive information via this Web Site, their information is protected both online and off-line. When our registration/order forms ask Subscribers and Members to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number, billing information, etc.), that information is encrypted and is protected using industry standard encryption software (128 bit secure socket layers protocols).</p>

  <p>While we use SSL encryption protocols to protect sensitive information online, we also employ security measures to protect Subscribers and Members information off-line. All of our Subscriber and Member information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment.</p>
