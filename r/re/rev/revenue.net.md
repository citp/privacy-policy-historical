# :: Revenue.net :: An Internet Advertising Agency :: It's All About Your Revenue ::

At Oversee.net, we recognize that privacy is an important issue, so we design and operate our services with the protection of your privacy in mind. This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") outlines the types of personal information we gather when you use Oversee.net, as well as some of the steps we take to safeguard it. 

**Data collection**

* Oversee.net does not require any personally identifying information. 

* We collect limited non-personally identifying information your browser makes available whenever you visit a website. This log information includes your Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your query and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. We use this information to operate, develop and improve our services. 

* We use Coremetrics, a service provider, to help us gather and analyze information about our customers. Coremetrics’ only role is to help us conduct our business and deliver the most relevant products and services. If you would like to deactivate our ability to analyze your anonymous browsing and purchase behavior through the use of this service or find out more about our service provider, including its privacy policy and how to opt out, go to: <http://www.coremetrics.com/info_eluminate2.html>

**Cookies**

Upon your first visit to Oversee.net, a cookie is sent to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. A "cookie" is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service and to better understand how people interact with us. Oversee.net does this by storing user preferences in cookies and by tracking user trends and patterns of how people search. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. 

**Changes In Terms and Conditions**

We reserve the right, at our sole and absolute discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of these terms at any time without notice and, unless otherwise indicated, such changes will become effective immediately; therefore, please check these terms periodically for changes. Your continued use of the Site following the posting of changes to this Agreement will mean you accept those changes. 

**Updating your information**

We provide mechanisms for updating and correcting your personally identifying information for many of our services. For more information, please see the help pages for each service. 

**Links**

* Except for sites controlled by Oversee.net and its subsidiaries, sister and parent companies, any sites that may be linked to by Oversee.net are developed by people over whom Oversee.net exercises no control. These other sites may place their own cookies on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy policy of each web site that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by this web site. 

* Oversee.net may present links in a format that enables us to understand whether they have been followed. We use this information to understand and improve the quality of Oversee.net's search technology. For instance, this data helps us determine how often users are satisfied with the first result of a query and how often they proceed to later results. 

**Changes to this Policy**

Please note this Privacy Policy will change from time to time. We expect most such changes to be minor, but there may be changes that are more significant. Regardless, we will post those changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will also provide a more prominent notice. We archive each version of our Policy and each version will be noted at the top of the page. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20061229102937id_/http%3A//www.revenue.net/contact.mas) any time at privacy@oversee.net.
