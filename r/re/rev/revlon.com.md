# Revlon Global Privacy Policy - Revlon

Effective Date: May 1, 2018

Revlon Consumer Products Corporation and our employees, agents, subsidiaries, and affiliates (collectively, “Revlon,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) are committed to safeguarding your personal information. We have adopted and implemented this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) as part of our commitment to protecting your personal information across all of our websites, mobile apps, and other online properties that link to this Privacy Policy (the “Sites”). This Privacy Policy applies only to the Sites, and covers only information collected in connection with your access to and use of the Sites. We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy to learn about how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your personal information and about the choices you can make regarding information you share. Revlon is the entity responsible for processing personal information (i.e., the data controller) under this Privacy Policy.

Because we are a global company, this Privacy Policy takes into consideration various privacy regulations and frameworks governing the collection, use, maintenance, sharing, and disposition of personal information. Our privacy practices may vary among the countries in which we operate to reflect local practices and legal requirements. In addition, while this Privacy Policy is intended to describe the broadest range of our personal information processing activities globally, the processing activities in some jurisdictions may be more limited based on restrictions under local laws or based on the products and services being offered.

Additional information relating to our practices and the rights of residents in specific countries is provided at the end of the Privacy Policy in the Country-Specific Notices section.

PERSONAL INFORMATION

These cookies are necessary to allow us to operate our Sites so you can access the Sites as you have requested.

For further information about how to do so, please refer to your browser ‘help,’ ‘tool,’ or ‘edit’ section or visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/). Please note that if you use your browser settings to block all cookies (including strictly necessary cookies) you may not be able to access or use all or part or certain functionalities of our Sites.

If you want to remove previously-stored cookies, you can manually delete them at any time. However, this will not prevent our Sites from placing cookies on your device in the future, unless and until you adjust your internet browser setting as described above.

For more information about the development of user profiles and the use of targeting/advertising cookies, please see [www.youronlinechoices.eu](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/) if you are located in the European Union.

_Your Choice to Provide Information_

You can choose not to provide personal information to Revlon by refraining from, among other things, making purchases, using our services, applying for a job, and requesting information. You also may refrain from submitting information directly to us. However, if you do not provide personal information when requested, we may not be able to provide you with the full range of our products and services, or with information about our products, services, promotions, and other opportunities.

We reserve the right to store your personal information to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.

_Your Rights_

You have certain rights regarding the personal information that we maintain about you, which in certain circumstances you will be able to exercise. These rights are as follows:

  * You may request a copy of the personal information that we maintain about you. If we maintain your information based on your consent or so that we could enter into a contract with you, you can also request that we provide you a copy of your information in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format.
  * If your information is incorrect, you may request that we correct, amend, or delete information that is inaccurate.
  * You may request that we erase or restrict the processing of your personal information.
  * You may object to the processing of your personal information in certain circumstances when we process your data for the purposes of our legitimate interests.



Subject to applicable law, we will comply with your request as soon as practicable, and in any event, within not more than 1 month after receiving a valid request. If your request is particularly complicated, we may have to extend this period to 2 months. Any request to exercise these rights will be assessed in accordance with applicable law and there may be circumstances where we are not legally required to comply with your request. For example, we may reject requests that we determine are unreasonably repetitive or that risk the privacy of others. Access and correction requests may be done for free, unless they are repetitive, excessive or unfounded, in which case we may charge you the administrative costs we have incurred handling the request.

Some of these rights can be exercised online via your account. For example, you can review, modify, and delete certain information relating to your use of our Sites and unsubscribe to email, text, or other messages. If you are unable to manage your request via your online account then please contact us at [privacypolicy@revlon.com](mailto:privacypolicy@revlon.com?subject=Revlon%20Privacy%20Policy%20Inquiry).

_Right to Opt Out of Marketing or Withdraw Consent_

In addition, you may at any time tell us not to send you marketing communications by email by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link within the marketing emails you receive from us or by contacting us as indicated below. We will apply your preferences going forward, subject to applicable law.

In some circumstances, withdrawing your consent to Revlon’s use or disclosure of your personal information will mean that you will not be able to take advantage of certain Revlon products and services.

_Complaints_

If you are unhappy or have concerns about the way in which we have handled your personal information, please contact us (see “How You Can Contact Us”) so that we can try to resolve the issue. We encourage you to get in touch with us first; however, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with the applicable supervisory authority.
