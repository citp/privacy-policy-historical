# Privacy Policy - Group Nine Media

This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes how we collect, use, disclose, and store information we obtain through your use of the websites, tools, online or offline offerings, and applications (collectively, the “Services”) that are operated by, controlled, or affiliated with Group Nine Media, Inc., its subsidiaries (including without limitation Thrillist Media Group, Inc., Seeker Media, Inc., TheDodo.com, Inc., NowThis Media, Inc.) and affiliated entities (collectively, “GNM,” “we,” or “us”). This Privacy Policy only covers information collected through the Services and does not cover any information collected at any other website, application or offline by us (unless specifically stated), including when you call us, write to us, or communicate with us in any manner other than through the Services. 

GNM respects your concerns about privacy, and recognize that we must maintain and use your information responsibly. Please review this Privacy Policy carefully. When you submit information to or through the Services, you consent to the collection and processing of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with any part of this Privacy Policy do not use any of the Services. 

Whenever possible, we will provide you written notice of our changes to this Privacy Policy and update the Last Updated date above. Your continued use of the Services after the Last Updated date constitutes your acceptance of the amended Privacy Policy, which supersedes all previous versions. 

##  INFORMATION WE COLLECT: 

When we refer to “Personal Information”, we mean information associated with or used to identify or contact a specific person. Such Personal Information includes: name, email address, telephone number, employer name, credit card or bank information. 

We may also collect general information (“Usage Data”) regarding your use of the Services. This Usage Data can refer to demographic information, information about preferences, interests, search queries, and online activity. Generally Usage Data does not identify you personally, however, in the event that general information is collected with Personal Information and cannot be separated, we will treat it as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. 

“Location Data” may also be collected as you use the Services. Such information will include the location of the mobile device or computer used to access the Services derived from GPS or WiFi use. Accordingly, this Location Data may contain the IP address of the mobile device or computer or internet service used to access the Services. Independently, such information shall be treated as Usage Data, however in the event that such information collected cannot be separated from Personal Information, we will treat it as Personal Information. 

We may combine the information we collect from you with the information collected from other third party sources, including our third-party service providers. In some instances by associating a social media account with these Services you may give us access to certain additional Personal Information stored by such third-party. By doing so you agree that we may collect, use, and store the information provided by such third-party as described in this Privacy Policy. 

Our primary goal in collecting information is to provide you, the user, with a customized experience on our Services. This includes personalization services, interactive communications, and many other types of services, all of which are completely free to you. Both general information as well as any Personal Information you provide to us is maintained on secure servers and our internal systems. 

##  How We Collect Information: 

We collect information that you provide to us and from your use of the Services. The information that we collect and how we process it depends on how you use and access the Services. Some of the information is collected automatically through the use of cookies and similar data collection tools, other types of information may be collected as follows: 

Generally, Personal Information may be collected if you sign up for an online newsletter; if you contact us with a question; if you choose to participate in a contest or sweepstakes; if you make a purchase of a product produced by GNM or a ticket to an event sponsored by GNM; and if you register for one of our websites through a social media site such as Facebook. Please bear in mind that any content ( _e.g._ , comments, photographs, information and other materials) that you post directly on our Services can be read, collected or used by others; accordingly, please exercise caution when deciding to disclose any Personal Information in public activities or submissions. 

Third parties that assist us with our business operations also collect information (including Personal Information and Usage Data) about you through the Services or otherwise, and share it with us. GNM works with other social networks and platforms to bring you the Services. Personal Information you provide by interacting with us through social media, including photographs, may be collected via any integration with those applications or services. Please review the privacy policies and settings of any applications or social networks should you have any questions about the type of information collected or shared accordingly. We may also use third parties to supplement the information regarding the users of our Services. In the event such information is added to information we’ve collected through our standard means we will apply the terms of this Privacy Policy to that combined information. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we use, among other services, Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”), and the Google Analytics tracking code implemented by us supports Display Advertising and its features ( _e.g._ , Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration, and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting). You can opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display ads using the Google Ads Preferences Manager. 

We may use “cookies,” “device identifiers” or similar types of technology ( _e.g._ , pixels tags, web beacons, embedded scripts, clear GIFs, and local storage) to collect information about your use of our Services. For your information, “cookies” are files that are stored on your computer’s hard drive by a website, and “device identifiers” are files that are stored on your mobile device that identify your device. In addition, we may use third parties to provide products and services to you through our Services. Third parties may also employ cookies, device identifiers, or similar technologies for the purposes of data collection.  Note: most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies.  Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of all of our Services’ features.  In addition, disabling cookies may cancel opt-outs that rely on cookies, such as targeted advertising opt-outs. You can find more information about cookies and how they work at [http://www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/). Additionally, your mobile device may provide you with information and choices on what data is shared with us. 

When you visit our Services, we may automatically collect certain technical information, such as the computer operating system or mobile device that you use to access our Services, your Internet Protocol address, your browser type and settings, your bandwidth speed and information about the software programs that are installed on your computer, the date and time that you access our Services, the web pages you were visiting immediately before and after you came to our Services, the domain name of the website from which you linked to our Services, search terms that visitors use to reach our Services, information on actions taken on our Services (such as page views and site navigation patterns) and links and advertisements that you click on within our Services and other technical information that assists us in improving our Services. 

##  Third Party Content, Widgets, and Links to Third Party Sites 

The Services may contain, or link to, content that is hosted and served by third parties, which may include third party widgets (such as those that allow you to share content with third party web sites and online services). Our Services may also contain links to other third party web sites that we do not control. In addition, our widgets may be included on web pages and web sites that are not associated with us, and over which we have no control. These third parties may collect information about you through the use of their own cookies and web beacons, may independently collect data or solicit Personal Information, and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. GNM is not responsible for the privacy practices employed by any third party. 

###  International Transfer of Information 

If you provide us with Personal Information during your use of the Services, we may transfer that information to our affiliates and subsidiaries or to other third parties, across borders, and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are visiting from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that you may be transferring your Personal Information to the United States, which does not have the same data protection laws as the EU or other countries. By providing this Personal Information, you consent to the use of such information for the uses identified in this Privacy Policy; and the transfer of your Personal Information to the United States as indicated herein.

We may combine Personal Information with Usage Data collected and information we receive from our business partners and other third parties as permitted by applicable law.  We may use that combined information to enhance and personalize your browsing experience with us, to communicate with you about products, services and events that may be of interest to you, for other promotional purposes, and for other purposes described in this Privacy Policy. 

##  How We Share Information: 

We do not disclose Personal Information about you, except as expressly described in this Privacy Policy.  For the sake of emphasis, we will never rent or sell your Personal Information. 

We may share the Personal Information we collect with our affiliate and subsidiary companies, ad network vendors and their participants, and other third parties for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, including to communicate with you about products and services, offers, events and promotions that we believe may be of interest to you.  We also may disclose your Personal Information to our vendors, subcontractors, and business partners, and other third parties who provide services to us.  However, they are only permitted to access your information in connection with performing such services and are not authorized by us to use the information for their own benefit. We may also share information collected to third parties as a part of any business transaction including, but not limited to, mergers, acquisitions, and sales of all or substantially all of our assets, or any similar event requiring a diligence process. 

We also may disclose any Personal Information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process (such as a court order), (ii) in response to a request by law enforcement authorities, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal or fraudulent activity. 

Our properties may feature Nielsen proprietary measurement software, which will allow you to contribute to market research. To learn more about the information that Nielsen software may collect and your choices with regard to it, please see the Nielsen Digital Measurement Privacy Policy <http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/privacy-statement/digital-measurement.html#choices>

Please note that any information you include in a message you post to any chat room, forum or other public posting area is available to anyone with Internet access. If you do not want people to know your e-mail address, for example, do not include it in any message you post publicly. PLEASE BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL WHEN DISCLOSING ANY INFORMATION IN CHAT ROOMS, FORUMS AND OTHER PUBLIC POSTING AREAS. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE BY OTHERS OF THE INFORMATION THAT YOU DISCLOSE IN CHAT ROOMS, FORUMS AND OTHER PUBLIC POSTING AREAS. 

##  Regarding Online Advertising: 

We often use standard tracking and delivery technology to serve you relevant advertising.  Third parties provide some of those services and those parties may collect and use click stream information derived from their advertisements, whether clicked on or scrolled over during your use of the Services. The use of third party tracking technologies to collect this information is often subject to their own privacy policies. Some of the third parties noted herein may be members of the Network Advertising Initiatve or the Digital Advertising Alliance. For an explanation of that technology and how to control the tracking, the consumer awareness section of the Digital Advertising Alliance’s website (www.aboutads.info/consumers) provides a good overview. For more information about targeted advertising and the opt-out procedures of Network Advertising Initiative members, see <http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/>. 

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, on our Services we may also serve advertisements to you via targeted advertising methods. In doing so we may send to you certain advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests based on information provided to us by our users, by third parties, and information collected about your online activities. You may also see certain ads though your use of the Services because we participate in advertising networks.  Ad networks allow us to target our advertising to users through demographic, behavioral and contextual means. 

If you access the Services through a mobile device, we may offer certain location or pinpoint based services. If you elect to use such features, we must receive (periodically) your location in order to provide you access to the Services. By doing so, you authorize us to: (i) locate your hardware; (ii) record, compile and display your location; and (iii) publish your location to third parties designated by you by means of location publication controls available within the applications (settings, or user preferences). As part of the location-based services, we may also collect and store certain information about the users who elect to use such location-based services, such as a device id. We may use third-party providers to help provide location-based services through mobile systems and we may provide information to enable them to facilitate the location-based services. 

##  California Privacy Rights: 

As stated elsewhere in this privacy policy, we do not share personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes, as defined by California Civil Code Section 1798.83, unless we give you choice (opt-in or opt-out) before sharing with those third parties. 

Beginning January 1, 2005, under California law, if you are a resident of California, you may make a written request to us about how we have shared your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. In response to your written request, we will identify the categories of information shared and will include a list of the third parties and affiliates with which it was shared, along with their names and address.  Please submit a written request to the following address: California Policy Manager, Group Nine Media, Inc., 568 Broadway, Ste. 506, New York, NY 10012; or, email support(at)Groupninemedia(dot)com with the subject line “California Policy” and your request in the body of your email. 

GNM recognizes that you may have configured your Internet browsers to send “Do Not Track” signals to the online services you visit. California Business & Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how GNM responds to such “Do Not Track” browser settings. As there are currently no set guidelines as to what “Do Not Track” means in the context of our business, and our Services do not alter their current modes when they receive a “Do Not Track” signal. Should you wish to learn more about “Do Not Track”, visit [http://www.allaboutdnt.com](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/). 

##  Access to Your Personal Information and Correction: 

You may obtain a copy of certain Personal Information we maintain about you or update or correct inaccuracies in that information using the online account you may establish on our Services.  In addition, if you wish to delete your information from our database please let us know by contacting us as indicated in the “How to Contact Us” section of this Privacy Policy. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request, but please note that we may be required to keep such information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements). When we delete any information, it will be deleted from the active database, but may remain in our archives. We may also retain your information for fraud or similar purposes. 

##  Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions: 

We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (any, a “ **Promotion** ”) that may require registration. By participating in a Promotion, you are agreeing to the terms, conditions or official rules that govern that Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you, including, except where prohibited by law, allowing GNM or any alternative sponsor(s) of the Promotion to use your name, voice, likeness or other indicia of persona in advertising or marketing associated with the Promotion. If you choose to enter a Promotion, Personal Information may be disclosed to third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such Promotion including, without limitation, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law or permitted by the Promotion's official rules, such as on a winners list. 

##  How to Unsubscribe From Our Communications: 

You can unsubscribe from receiving our emails at any time by clicking on the “Unsubscribe” link in the footer of any applicable GNM email and following the instructions. You can also unsubscribe by clicking on the “Unsubscribe” link on the bottom of any applicable GNM website and following the instructions. Despite your indicated e-mail preferences, we may send you service-related communications, including notices of any updates to our Terms and Conditions or Privacy Policy. 

##  How We Protect Personal Information: 

We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to assist us in protecting the Personal Information we collect against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use. For example, we use 256-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your online order information. SSL technology encrypts your order information to protect it from being decoded by anyone other than us. We also limit access to Personal Information about you to employees or service providers who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that Personal Information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. 

While we implement these and other security measures on our Services, please note that 100% security is not always possible.  We cannot guarantee that the security measures we have in place to safeguard Personal Information will never be defeated or fail, or that those measures will always be sufficient or effective.  You play a role in protecting your information as well. Because your password permits access to your Personal Information, please keep your password secret and do not disclose it to others. 

##  Children’s Privacy: 

We are concerned about the privacy of young children.  Accordingly, we do not direct our websites to children under the age of thirteen.  We also require registered users of the Services to be at least eighteen years old.  If we learn that a user is under eighteen years of age, we will promptly delete any Personal Information that the individual has provided to us. 

##  Updates to this Privacy Policy: 

This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically and without prior notice to you to reflect changes in our Personal Information practices. We will notify you of changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy here and updating the “Last Updated” date above.
