## INTRODUCTION

This Privacy Policy applies to our physical location(s), the website, mobile application or other digital service (each a “LVRJ Service”) linking to this Privacy Policy and owned or operated by Las Vegas Review-Journal, Inc. (“Review-Journal”, “LVRJ”, “we”, “us” or “our”). This Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of the Las Vegas Review-Journal only and does not cover the practices of other companies, including those that may advertise or sponsor content, products or services on the LVRJ Services.

## WHAT INFORMATION WE OBTAIN

When you use an LVRJ Service, we may obtain various types of information related to you and your use of the LVRJ Service. This may include information that directly identifies you such as your name, address, or contact information (this type of information may be called “personal information” or “personally identifiable information”). The information we obtain generally consists of information (1) you give us about yourself, (2) you give us about others, (3) automatically collected about your interactions with the LVRJ Services and our content or ads on third-party websites, apps or other media, and (4) we get from other sources.

### Information you give us

We may ask you to provide information about yourself when you use the LVRJ Services. For example, to subscribe to one of our newsletters or news alerts, you will need to give us an email address. You may not be able to use certain features if you choose not to submit the requested information.

The information you give us may include details such as:

* Contact information (e.g., name, mailing address, email address or phone number). 
* Demographic, interests and household information (e.g., age, gender or education). 
* Payment information for subscriptions or purchases made through the LVRJ Services (e.g., payment card number, expiration date and billing information). 
* Comments, photos, videos and other content or information you choose to publish on the LVRJ Services or otherwise share with us. 
* Information you provide when you make subscription choices, including your choice of a username, password, and associated email address. 
* Information you provide when you choose to participate in surveys, polls, sweepstakes, contests or promotions (including information about your participation in activities that may generate loyalty or rewards points). 
* Location information, which may include precise location information when you permit the LVRJ Services to access device location. To prevent the collection of precise location information, please refer to 
* instructions provided by your mobile service provider or device manufacturer. 
* Other information you may allow us to access through your device’s permissions settings, such as your contacts or address book. 
* Transactional and activity information (e.g., requests, searches or orders).

### Information you give us about others

You may give us information about other people, such as the name and email of a friend or contact with whom you want to share an article or the name and address of a gift subscription recipient. Do not give us information about others unless you are authorized or have their consent to do so. Under no circumstances may you provide us information about anyone under the age of 13. We will use their information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

### Information automatically collected

The LVRJ Services automatically log certain information about visits to the LVRJ Services, such as the number and frequency of visitors, technical information about browsers and devices used to access the LVRJ Services, and information about crashes or other technical issues. In addition, we and third parties may automatically collect certain information through automated means about your activities over time across the LVRJ Services as well as across third-party sites, apps or other media. The tools that collect this information vary depending on the LVRJ Services and include technologies such as cookies, web beacons, tags, scripts, pixels, local shared objects (including HTML5 cookies) and software development kits (“SDKs”). These technologies may be included in our web pages, mobile apps, emails, and other digital content and are as follows:

• **Cookies.** When you use the LVRJ Services, we may place small files, called “cookies” onto your computer. Cookies are data files that websites write onto computer hard drives for record keeping purposes when you visit them. The cookie file then identifies you as a unique user. Cookies make your use of the LVRJ Service more pleasing and efficient by “personalizing” your LVRJ Service experience and gathering website statistical data, such as which parts of the Website you have previously visited, what material you downloaded, your Internet provider’s domain name and country, and the addresses of websites you linked from immediately before and linked to immediately after the LVRJ Service. They enable us to tailor the information you receive and to assist our partners or other third party organizations with whom we have strategic alliances by identifying you as our customer or LVRJ Service user. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, unless you have configured yours not to accept them. You can program your browser not to accept cookies, but if you do, you may not be able to use certain portions of the Website and the Website will not be able to customize certain features according to your preferences.  
• **Web Beacons.** Small graphic images or web programming code called web beacons (also known as “pixel tags” or “clear GIFs”) may be included on the pages of the Website and in email messages we send you. Web beacons or other similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, such as to count visitors to the Website, or to count how many particular articles or links posted on the website were actually viewed.  
While specific types of cookies and technologies may change from time to time as we improve and update the Services, cookies used by the Services generally fall into the categories below:

• **Security and Authentication (Strictly Necessary Cookies):** These cookies are essential to provide you with the Services and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Without these cookies, we can’t provide parts of the LVRJ Services that you request, like secure login accounts and transactional pages. 

• **Performance & Functionality Cookies:** We use performance cookies to analyze how the LVRJ Services are being accessed and used, or how the LVRJ Services are performing in order to maintain, operate and continually improve the LVRJ Services about choices you’ve made and allow us to customize the LVRJ Services to you. When you continue to use or return to the LVRJ Services, we can remember choices you make (such as login credentials, language preference, country location or other online settings) and provide the personalized or enhanced features that you select. 

• **Social Networks:** Some technologies help you to interact with social networks you are signed into while using the LVRJ Services, such as sharing content with the social network, logging in with the social network, and other features you employ with the social network, or that are allowed in the social network’s privacy policy. These may be set and controlled by the social networks, and your preferences with those social networks. You can manage your privacy preferences for these social networks and their tools and widgets via your account with the social network. 

• **Advertising or Targeting Cookies:** These cookies allow us and third parties to gather information about the content you’re browsing, your visit, or your interaction with ads and our communications, and to display ads that are relevant to you and measure their effectiveness. Certain third party cookies may also track your activity across various sites to display ads relevant to you and your interests on third party sites and applications. Most advertising or targeting cookies set by the LVRJ Services belong to our service providers. 

The tools may assign or collect unique cookie IDs or other identifiers associated with your browser or device. The tools may collect information while you are using our LVRJ Service or while they are running in the background of your device.

The information automatically collected may include:

* Information about your computer, device, browser and operating system (e.g., type, model, or version). 
* Internet protocol (IP) address, which may be used to derive your general geographic area (e.g., city and country). 
* Device identifiers (e.g., mobile advertising IDs). 
* Information about your interactions with the LVRJ Services, including browsing activities and clickstream data that reflect the content you have accessed, clicked on, or viewed. 
* Information about how you accessed the LVRJ Services, including details about websites or apps visited immediately before or after accessing a Digital Service. 
* Demographic, interests and household information. 
* Information about your interactions with email messages and other communications, such as whether you opened or forwarded the email or clicked on links contained in the email.

### Information we obtain from other sources

We receive information about you from other sources and it may be combined with other information about you. For example, we may obtain data from:

* Operators of third-party sites or apps, content distribution channels and platforms (e.g., Roku, Amazon Fire TV), voice-activated assistants (e.g., Amazon Alexa, Google Home) or other devices and technologies when you interact with our content, products, services or ads available on those channels and platforms. The information we receive may include information about the content you view or access as well as your demographic information and information about your interests. 
* Third-party data suppliers such as data aggregators, data resellers, public databases and business partners. They may provide us with demographic information, information about your purchases, and other information that helps us learn about you and other users of the LVRJ Services. 
* Social Media Platforms and similar services (“Social Media Platforms”). When you engage with our content or ads on Social Media Platforms, or interact with features on the LVRJ Services that contain content or features provided by Social Media Platforms (e.g., login or sign in features or tools that allow you to share our content with others on Social Media Platforms), we may obtain information from Social Media Platforms, including your username, user ID, demographic information and other information, subject to the settings and privacy practices of the relevant Social Media Platform. We may obtain this information directly from the Social Media Platform or through plug-ins, integrations or applications. Please keep in mind that the operators of the Social Media Platforms may also gather information about your use of the LVRJ Services and their features and tools.

### HOW WE USE INFORMATION WE OBTAIN

If you make a purchase or place an order through or in connection with an LVRJ Service, through our third-party processor Authorize.net, we use your payment card information (e.g., your card number and expiration date) for limited purposes such as to process your transaction (including recurring payments, if applicable), to provide you with the requested products or services, and for the purposes described under the section “To protect our rights or the rights of others” below. To find out more information about how Authorize.net collects, uses, and protects your payment card information, please review their Privacy Policy, bearing in mind that, while linked, LVRJ does not control or have any control over third-party websites such as Authorize.net and is not responsible for anything that happens on any third-party website.

With respect to information other than your payment card information, we use that information:

### To provide you with the LVRJ Services.

This includes:

* Processing your requests regarding the LVRJ Services and our subscriptions, products or services, or your participation in a survey, sweepstakes, contest, promotion, event or similar initiative. 
* Processing your account, including, at times, verifying that the e-mail address you provide is active and valid. 
* Providing customer assistance or technical support. 
* Responding to inquiries. 
* Providing customer services and resolving any complaints or other issues. 
* Improve our LVRJ Services and resolving any technical problems. 
* Customizing content, providing recommendations and enhancing the quality and your overall experience with the LVRJ Services, including by retaining your user preferences or presenting content in the most effective manner for the browser or device you use to access the LVRJ Services. 
* Maintaining, operating, improving and developing the LVRJ Services and related content, products or services, including developing new products and features based on users’ interactions with the LVRJ Services. 
* Ensuring compliance with our Terms of Services. 
* Complying with applicable laws and regulations. 
* Learning about users of the LVRJ Services and analyzing how you and others interact with and respond to the LVRJ Services, including by measuring and optimizing usage, reliability and performance, conducting market research, analyzing trends, and supporting our operations (e.g., for accounting, auditing, financial, legal or other purposes). 
* For any other purpose disclosed to you at the time we collect your information or pursuant to your consent. 

### To communicate with you.

This includes:

* Sending you informational messages about the LVRJ Services (e.g., to confirm your subscription or notify you of changes to a LVRJ Service). 
* Delivering marketing or promotional communications, including offers or promotions about our or third parties’ products, services or other initiatives. 
* Responding to your questions or addressing your requests. 
* Communicating with you about surveys, sweepstakes, contests, promotions or events. 
* For any other purpose disclosed to you at the time we collect your information or pursuant to your consent. 

### For advertising and marketing purposes, including interest-based advertising.

This includes:

* Developing, managing and conducting advertising and marketing campaigns, promotions and offers, including about our content, products and services or third parties’ products, services and other initiatives. 
* Interest-based advertising (also known as targeted or personalized advertising or ads) is advertising based on your interests as inferred from your activities over time on the LVRJ Services and online services operated by third parties, as well as information from other sources. Interest-based ads may consist of text ads, images, animations or videos and may be displayed to you based on various factors, including the context of the site or app in which they appear (e.g., business or sports section), information you provided to the operator of the site or app (e.g., when you created an account), your activities on the site or app (e.g., pages viewed, searches performed or ads clicked), and information such as your demographic, interests and household information. 
* On the LVRJ Services and on third-party sites, apps or other media, we, our service providers and third parties may use automated means to (a) collect information for interest-based advertising purposes or (b) serve you interest-based ads. These automated means vary depending on the LVRJ Services and include technologies such as cookies, web beacons, tags, scripts, pixels, local shared objects (including HTML5 cookies) and SDKs (software development kits). These technologies may use unique identifiers associated with your browser or device to support interest-based advertising. 
* We may use online and offline information we obtain about you, including your personal information, for interest-based advertising purposes. We may aggregate the information we obtain to create audiences that are most likely to respond to ads based on demographic, interests or household information.  
Interest-based ads may be displayed to you by third parties, such as ad networks or exchanges. 
* There are steps you can take to limit the collection of your information for interest-based advertising purposes. These steps vary for the web and mobile app environments and are browser and device specific. To learn more about interest-based advertising and opt-out choices, see <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/> and here. 
* In serving interest-based ads, we adhere to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising developed by the Digital Advertising Alliance. 
* Cross-device linking. If you access the LVRJ Services from multiple browsers or devices, we, our service providers and third parties may try to establish connections among and link the different browsers and devices you use to access the LVRJ Services and our content or ads published elsewhere. This helps us provide you with a seamless experience across the browsers and devices you use and serve you with more relevant content and ads (e.g., so that we don’t show you the same article twice). See here for steps you can take to limit browser and mobile app tracking for interest-based advertising purposes. 
* Analyzing and measuring the performance, effectiveness and reach of our advertising (including interest-based ads) and marketing efforts on the LVRJ Services and elsewhere.

### To protect our rights or the rights of others.

This includes: 

Detecting, preventing and responding to fraud or potentially illegal activities, misuse of the LVRJ Services, intellectual property infringement or other violations of law, this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use or other Las Vegas Review-Journal policies. 

Performing audits, assessments and testing or troubleshooting activities. 

Backing up our systems (including for disaster recovery purposes) and enhancing the overall security of the LVRJ Services.

**Social Media Platforms.** If you interact with social media widgets, share content using social media share buttons, or access features of the LVRJ Services that contain content or features provided by Social Media Platforms, the relevant Social Media Platforms may collect information. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of the Social Media Platforms that you engage with as we are not responsible for their privacy practices.  
**Business Partners.** We may provide your information to business partners including, without limitation, joint marketing partners and content sponsors, for various purposes. For example, we may partner with a third party to offer products on a co-branded, co-sponsored or cross-promotional basis that involves the sharing of information. These initiatives may be offered on the LVRJ Services or on other media.  
**Other Parties When Required by Law or As Necessary to Protect Our Rights.** We may share your information as we believe is necessary or appropriate to protect, enforce, or defend our legal rights, the privacy or safety of our employees, users of the LVRJ Services or other individuals and entities, or to comply with or enforce applicable industry standards, law or legal process, including responding to court orders, warrants, subpoenas and other requests from public and government authorities.

**With Your Consent or Otherwise at Your Direction.** In addition, we may share your information with third parties when you consent to or request such sharing.

## YOUR CHOICES, INCLUDING MARKETING AND INTEREST-BASED ADS OPT-OUTS

### Direct Marketing Opt-Outs

* **Email marketing.** You may opt out of receiving marketing or promotional emails from us by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link contained in such emails. Depending on the LVRJ Service you use, you also may be able to opt out of marketing or promotional emails by logging into your account and managing your email preferences. Please keep in mind that if you opt out of receiving marketing or promotional emails, we may still send you transactional emails or other communications relating to your use of the LVRJ Services (e.g., to confirm your subscription, to inform you of changes to an LVRJ Service or in response to your password recovery request). 
* **Text message marketing.** If you choose to participate in a text message marketing campaign or promotion offered in connection with a LVRJ Service, you may opt out of receiving marketing texts from us by following the instructions contained in those messages (e.g., texting the word STOP) or provided to you when you elected to receive text message marketing.

* **Co-Branded, Co-Sponsored or Cross-Promotional Offerings.** If you choose to participate in a co-branded, co-sponsored or cross-promotional offering, the brand, sponsor or other third party involved in that offering may use your information for its own purposes, including advertising and marketing purposes. You must contact the relevant third party directly to exercise your opt out choices with respect to such party’s use of your information.

### Interest-Based Ads Opt-Outs

Some of the ads you see on the LVRJ Services are interest-based ads. This means that these ads are customized based on the information we and others obtain about you. We describe below steps you can take to limit tracking of your activities and the delivery of interest-based ads in browsers and mobile apps you use to access the LVRJ Services. Please keep in mind that if you opt out of interest-based ads, you will still see ads, but these ads will not be based on your inferred interests. In addition, if you take the steps described below, some automated means may still be used to collect information about your interactions with the LVRJ Services for the other purposes described in this Privacy Policy (e.g., to remember user preferences or enable specific functionality).

The technologies used to deliver ads on websites and mobile apps differ. Please also remember that opt-outs are browser and device-specific.

### Website (Browser) Opt-Out

**Disabling Cookies.** Most browsers accept cookies by default. You may be able to change the settings to have your browser refuse certain cookies or notify you before accepting cookies.  
If you choose to disable the use of cookies in your web browser, some features of the LVRJ Services may become difficult to use or unavailable.

* **Opt-out Cookies.** You can follow the instructions provided by the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) here and/or the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) here to place an opt-out cookie on your browser. These opt-out cookies enable you to block participating companies from installing future cookies on your computer or browser.  
If you place opt-out cookies but subsequently clear or delete cookies on your computer or device browser, your opt-out cookies may be deleted and you may have to renew your opt- out choices for that specific browser.  
The opt-out mechanisms offered by the DAA and NAI are provided by third parties. Las Vegas Review-Journal, Inc. does not control or operate these mechanisms or the choices provided through these mechanisms. 

### Mobile App Opt-Out

* **Device Settings.** To limit interest-based advertising on your mobile device, you can review and adjust the settings provided by your device manufacturer, such as “Limit Ad Tracking” for iOS or “Opt-out of interest-based ads ” for Android. 
* **AppChoices Application.** You can download the “AppChoices” application provided by the DAA from your app store. AppChoices offers a mechanism to limit the collection of app data used for interest-based ads by participating companies. See here for more.  
Please keep in mind that as the mobile environment continues to evolve, additional opt-out mechanisms or privacy settings may become available to you. We encourage you to review the information on opt-outs and settings that device manufacturers, technology companies and industry associations make available to you.

### Additional Choices

* **User account.** If you have created an account on an LVRJ Service, you may be able to review some of your information for that account by logging in and updating your information or user preferences. 
* **Device Settings.** For relevant LVRJ Services, you may be able to review and adjust your preferences by updating the settings on your device (e.g., permitting us to collect precise location information). 
* **Push Notifications.** If an LVRJ Service enables push notifications on your device, you may review and update your push notification preferences by adjusting the settings on your device. For example, you can select the relevant app from “Notifications” (for iOS devices) or “App notifications” (for Android devices) and turn off alerts accordingly.

## HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION

We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we make reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.  


## NON-U.S. VISITORS

We operate the LVRJ Services from the United States. Any information we obtain about you in connection with your use of the LVRJ Services may be processed and stored in the United States or other countries.  


## CHILDREN’S PRIVACY RIGHTS

The LVRJ Services are not intended for use by children, especially those under the age of 13. Minors under 18 and at least 13 years of age are only permitted to use our Service through an account owned by a parent or legal guardian with their appropriate permission and under their direct supervision. We do not currently market to, solicit, or create special areas for use by children. Those under may not attempt to register for an LVRJ Service or send any information to us, including name, address, telephone number, or email address. In the event that we discover that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to us, in accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (please see the Federal Trade Commission’s website at <https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/privacy-and-security/children%27s-privacy> for more information about this Act), we will delete the child’s Personal Information from our files to the extent technologically possible.
