### Personal data of site visitors

We use Google Analytics to count the number of visits and how often individual web pages are viewed. We enabled the setting in Google Analytics to anonymize IP addresses before processing, so that these statistics can not be traced back to individuals.

When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data entered in comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string, as part of our efforts to help spam detection and prevention.

We process information about visitors who comment using the Akismet anti-spam service. The information we collect includes the commenter’s IP address, user agent, referrer, and Site URL (along with other information directly provided by the commenter such as their name, username, email address, and the comment itself).

An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your profile picture (if any) will visible to the public in the context of your comment.

If you do not want your personal data and profile picture to be visible in a comment on our site, then we recommend not posting that comment to begin with.

### Protecting our website from malicious activity

The IP address of visitors, and usernames being used in login attempts are logged to check for malicious activity, and to protect our sites from attacks. Examples of conditions when logging occurs include login attempts, requests for suspicious or non-existent URLs. This information is retained for 14 days and is never shared with any third party.

Our sites are part of a network of sites that are actively protected against distributed brute force attacks and other forms of malicious activity.
