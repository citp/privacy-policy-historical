# Privacy Statement

## REHAU COMMITMENT TO DATA PRIVACY PROTECTION

Protecting the security and privacy of your Personal Information is important to REHAU and to the way we conduct our business in compliance with laws on privacy, data protection and data security in the countries in which we maintain websites. We hope the policy outlined below will help you understand what information REHAU may collect, how REHAU uses and safeguards that information and with whom we may share it.

**Personal Information  
**

When you do provide us with Personal Information, we use it to respond to your inquiry, process your order or provide you access to specific account information. In addition, to support our customer relationship with you:  
\- we may store and process Personal Information and share it with our worldwide affiliates to better satisfy your requirements or improve our products and services; and  
\- we (or a third party on our behalf) may use Personal Information to contact you about a REHAU offer to benefit your business or to conduct surveys that help us better understand your needs.

If you choose not to have your Personal Information used to support our business relationship – particularly for direct marketing or market research 

– we will respect your choice. We do not now (nor do we intend to) sell, rent or otherwise market your Personal Information to third parties.

 **Non-Personal Information Collected Automatically  
** When you visit REHAU websites, information that is not personal (e.g., the web browser and operating system used, domain name of the websites you came from, number of visits, average duration of visits, pages viewed) is sometimes collected automatically (i.e., not only when registering). REHAU uses this information to find out how attractive our websites are and to improve their content. When you visit one of our websites, we may store data on your computer in the form of a “cookie” that automatically identifies you when you next visit. Cookies enable a website, for instance, to adapt to your specific interests or to save your password so that it is not necessary to enter it again every time. If you wish to refuse cookies, it is possible for you to set your Internet browser to delete cookies from your hard disc, to block all cookies or to warn you before a cookie is saved

 **Security  
** REHAU takes precautions to ensure the security of your Personal Information and strives to keep it accurate. We carefully protect your Personal Information from loss, destruction, falsification, manipulation, and unauthorized access or unauthorized disclosure.

 **Links to Other Websites  
** REHAU websites contain links to other websites. REHAU is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other websites.
