 **5.  Use of the SnapEngage live chat tool**

This website uses SnapEngage, a live chat service of SnapEngage, LLC. SnapEngage uses cookies, i.e., text files which are saved on your computer, and which permit an analysis of your use of the website. Information generated at SnapEngage is saved there in order to evaluate your use of the chats, which is rendered available to us as reports. If and when required, SnapEngage will pass on this information to third parties, provided this is legally required, or if third parties shall process this data on behalf of SnapEngage.

Upon request, SnapEngage will pass this data on to us. This data will be used for in-company purposes only.

 **6\. Use of Google Analytics  web analytics service**

This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses “cookies,” which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States.  On behalf of the website provider, Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage to the website provider. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. However, please note that if you do this, you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. 

You can refuse the use of Google Analytics by clicking on the following link. An opt-out cookie will be set on the computer, which prevents the future collection of your data when visiting this website: Deactivate Google Analytics

Further information concerning the terms and conditions of use and data privacy can be found at <http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/gb.html> or at <https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/>. Please note that on this website, Google Analytics code is supplemented by "anonymizeIp" to ensure an anonymized collection of IP addresses (so called IP-masking).

 **7\. Use of etracker web analytics service**

This website uses etracker technology (www.etracker.com) to collect and store data for marketing and optimization purposes. Anonymized usage profiles can be generated from these data. Cookies may be used for this purpose. Cookies are small text files that are stored locally in the browser storage of a website visitor. They enable the recognition of the browser on subsequent visits. The data collected with etracker technology will not be used to identify a visitor of the website and will not be aggregated with personal data without the explicit consent of the visitor. The collection and storage of data may be refused by a visitor at any time, at which point no further data will be collected: [Deactivate etracker](https://www.etracker.de/privacy?et=Qempd9).

 **8.  Use of Facebook plugin**

On our website, we use a pixel from Facebook Inc. This allows user behavior to be tracked after a user has been redirected to the provider’s website by clicking on a Facebook ad. The process enables evaluation of the effectiveness of Facebook ads for statistical and market research purposes, and can contribute to the optimization of future advertising activities. The data gathered remains anonymous for us, offering us no way to determine the identity of users. However, the data is saved and processed by Facebook, meaning a connection to the relevant user profile is possible and Facebook can use the data for its own advertising purposes in accordance with Facebook data usage guidelines: <https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/>.

The data may facilitate ads being shown by Facebook and its partners on and outside Facebook. Furthermore, a cookie can be stored on your computer for these purposes.

 **9.  Use of YouTube plugin**

To embed videos on our websites we use plugins from YouTube LLC (represented by Google Inc.) among other things. When you use our website, a connection is established to the YouTube servers and the plugin is displayed. This results in information being transmitted to the YouTube servers about which of our pages you have visited. If you are signed in to a YouTube account, YouTube records this information and allocates it to your personal user account. The use of the plugin also results in information being recorded in relation to your personal account when e.g., the start button of a video is clicked. You can prevent this information being recorded by logging out of your YouTube account and other user accounts with YouTube LLC and Google Inc. before using our websites and deleting the relevant cookies for these companies. You can find further information on data processing and tips on data protection from YouTube (Google) at: <https://www.google.de/intl/en-GB/policies/privacy/>.

 **10.  Use of Microsoft plugin**

Our website uses a conversion tracking tool from Microsoft Corporation. This involves a cookie being placed on your computer by Microsoft Bing Ads if you are directed to our site via a Microsoft Bing ad. This allows Microsoft Bing and us to detect that someone has clicked on the ad, been redirected to our website and reached the previously determined target page (conversion page). This process only informs us of the overall number of users who have clicked on a Bing ad and then been redirected to a conversion page. No personal information relating to the identity of the user is disclosed. If you would not like to take part in this tracking process, you can refuse to allow the necessary cookies to be placed on your computer – for example using a browser setting that prevents cookies being placed automatically. Further information on data privacy and the cookies used by Microsoft Bing can be found on the Microsoft website at: <https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement>.
