a) Replicon may obtain consent from individuals by receipt of consent from their employers or contractors where such employers or contractors have entered into an agreement with Replicon pursuant to which the employer or contractor, as agent for the individual, or with their authority, provides Replicon with consent to collect, use and disclose Personal Information regarding such individuals for the purposes of providing services or products to their employer or party to which they are contracted;

c) In certain circumstances, specifically those set out in applicable legislation, the law does not require that Replicon obtain consent or provide notification. Replicon reserves all its rights to rely on any available statutory exemptions and exceptions.

8\. EXCEPTIONS TO THE REQUIREMENT FOR CONSENT

Replicon may collect and use Personal Information without consent in circumstances that include but are not limited to the following:

a) Where a reasonable person would consider that the collection of the information is clearly in the interests of the individual and consent of the individual cannot be obtained in a timely way or the individual would not reasonably be expected to withhold consent;

b) Where the collection of the information is pursuant to a statute or regulation of either Alberta or Canada that authorizes or requires the collection;

c) Where the collection of the information is from a public body and that public body is authorized or required by an enactment of Alberta or Canada to disclose the Personal Information to Replicon;

d) Where the collection of the information is reasonable for the purposes of an investigation or a legal proceeding;

e) Where the information is publicly available;

f) Where the collection of the information is necessary in order to collect a debt owed to Replicon or for Replicon to repay to an individual money owed by Replicon;

g) In addition to the above, the law generally provides that an individual is deemed to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of Personal Information about that individual for a particular purpose if the individual voluntarily provides the information for that purpose, and it is reasonable that a person would voluntarily provide that information. If an individual provides Personal Information to us voluntarily, we will rely on deemed consent and consider that the individual consents to our collection, use or disclosure of their Personal Information as necessary to carry out the purposes for which they provided the information;

9\. LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL INFORMATION (EEA VISITORS ONLY)

a) If you are a visitor from the European Economic Area, our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Information described above will depend on the Personal Information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it;

b) We will normally collect Personal Information from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the Personal Information to perform under a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Information from you or may otherwise need the Personal Information to protect your vital interests or those of another person;

c) If we ask you to provide Personal Information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your Personal Information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your Personal Information);

d) Similarly, if we collect and use your Personal Information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are;

e) If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your Personal Information, please contact us using the contact details provided below.

10\. RETENTION AND DESTRUCTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

a) We retain Personal Information we collect from you in accordance with applicable law and where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a Service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements). Alberta law allows us, for legal or business purposes, to retain Personal Information for as long as is reasonable. Upon expiry of an appropriate retention period, bearing in mind reasonable legal and business requirements, Personal Information will either be destroyed in a secure manner or made anonymous;

b) Should consent to our collection, use, disclosure or retention of Personal Information be revoked by the individual in question, the law also allows us to continue to retain the information for as long as is reasonable for legal or business purposes. In the event that revocation of consent may have consequences to the individual concerned, we will advise the individual of the consequences of revoking their consent where it is reasonable in the circumstances to do so. When we collect, use or disclose Personal Information, we will make reasonable efforts to ensure that it is accurate, up to date, and complete.

11\. THIRD PARTY WEBSITES AND THIRD PARTY PLATFORMS

a) Please note that our website may contain links to other websites which are provided as a convenience for visitors to our website only, in addition to third party services, applications, and widgets that may be bundled into, included in, or provided in connection with our services;

b) Any third party websites, third party services, applications and widgets will have their own privacy policies and practices, and we cannot be responsible for such third parties, their websites, services, applications, widgets, or their privacy practices. Where “Third Party Services” (as defined in our Terms & Conditions) are provided or made available to you, you consent to your name, email address and any other reasonably required information being sent to the applicable third party to enable such third party to make its Third Party Services available or to provide you with its Third Party Services as required or requested by you, and to authenticate or validate you as a customer of Replicon that is entitled to such Third Party Service.

12\. CUSTOMER DATA

a) We may derive and create data and information about the use of the Services by our customers (“Use Data”) which may be disclosed to third party service providers in order to improve our Services;

b) We may derive anonymous data from Customer Data or Use Data and eliminate Personal Information from such Customer Data and Use Data so that such derived data cannot be used to identify a customer or its individual users (“Anonymous Data”);

a) We may use third party service providers, or provide or bundle in with our services software or services provided by third parties, to process or deal with records, documents, data and information on our behalf, or on your behalf, and such records, documents, data and information may include Personal Information;

b) Therefore, your Personal Information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective);

c) In order to protect the confidentiality and security of Personal Information processed on our behalf by our service providers, we use contractual and similar measures with such service providers, including contractual non-disclosure provisions. These include implementing the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies, which require all group companies to protect personal information they process from the EEA in accordance with European Union data protection law. Our standard Data Processing Agreement is available here www.replicon.com/resource/dpa/. We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request;

d) We may use “cloud computing” third party service providers, and those providers may be either in or outside Canada, and the data housed, hosted and processed by such providers may reside in or outside of Canada, and may include Personal Information. Replicon currently utilizes the following third party service providers to house, host and process Personal Information:  
i. Amazon Web Services, Inc.,  
ii. Bell Canada, Co-location Services.

We have therefore implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to secure against unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or destruction of Personal Information;

16\. NOTIFICATION OF LOSS OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR DISCLOSURE

a) In accordance with applicable law, we will notify the appropriate data protection authorities and affected individuals where an incident occurs involving the accidental or unlawful destruction, alteration, loss of or unauthorized access to or disclosure of Personal Information under our control. Where a reasonable person would consider that there exists a real risk of significant harm to an individual as a result of the loss or unauthorized access or disclosure, we will, without unreasonable delay, provide notice to the Information and Privacy Commissioner for Alberta of the incident, including any information required by law at the time to be provided to the Commissioner;

b) While Alberta law provides that the Commissioner has the authority to require us to notify individuals of the unauthorized access or disclosure, we may elect to immediately do so in the event we consider it reasonable in the circumstances.
