If you receive an email that asks you for your log in information or password, _it is not from us and you should not respond._

7\. Any e-mail or other communication requesting your password, asking you to provide sensitive account information via email, or linking to a website with a URL that does not begin with [https://www.reputation.com](https://www.reputation.com/) should be treated as unauthorized and suspicious and should be reported to Reputation.com, Inc., immediately by emailing [helpdesk@reputation.com](mailto:helpdesk@reputation.com).

Specifically, we use session cookies to track your session ID and to track whether or not you are logged into the Site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. Click [here](http://www.proxyway.com/www/delete-computer-cookies.html) for more information on how to remove persistent cookies.

6\. We employ, and our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that helps us better manage content on the Site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies and are used to learn about the interactions of our users with the Site and our outbound emails. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.

7\. We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the "Choice and Opt-out" section below.

### 7\. LINKED SITES

The Site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Reputation.com, Inc.

This privacy statement applies only to information collected by the Site.

### 8\. CHOICE AND OPT-OUT

1\. We provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes when we ask for this information. For example, if you purchase a product/service, but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference in the Site's account area.

2\. If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us at [helpdesk@reputation.com](mailto:helpdesk@reputation.com).
