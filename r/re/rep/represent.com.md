## INTEREST BASED ADVERTISING

Please note that we may ourselves or through a third party vendor use non-personally identifiable information in connection with our own or vendor information to display or deliver targeted advertising to you on our Site and to manage our advertising on other sites. Cookies, clickstream data, web beacons and other similar technologies may be used to collect information in order to provide personalized advertising. For example, if you are searching for information on a particular product, we or our vendor may cause an advertisement to appear on other websites you view with information on that product. This form of advertising, sometimes called “interest based advertising,” is based on anonymous information and not on any personal information. As a result, we and our vendor know your interests, but do not personally identify you in connection with the delivery of that specific ad. We believe that such advertising is helpful because you will see advertisements that are relevant to your interests. However, if you would like to opt-out of these interest-based advertisements, please follow the opt-out process described below under “Interest Based Advertising Opt-Out.”

## COOKIES

We may place small data files on your device or device hard drive known as “cookies” or a similar type of file (such as clear gifs, web beacons, tags, etc.) for the purpose of facilitating and enhancing your communication and interaction with the Site. Many websites use cookies for these purposes. Cookies are also used to collect general usage and volume statistical information. We use this information internally, to help us maintain and enhance the efficiency and usefulness of the Site. We may also use and place cookies on your device from our third party service providers in connection with the Site, such as an analytics provider that helps us manage and analyze Site usage. We also use session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. Our persistent cookies may remain active on your device for up to 1-3 years (depending upon the purpose of the cookie) or until you delete them manually. We set a persistent cookie to enable us to track and target the interests of users to enhance the services we provide. Cookies and similar items are not used by us to automatically retrieve personal information from your device without your knowledge. If you do not wish to receive cookies or want to restrict them or flush them from your device, you may do so by changing the settings on your computer or browser accordingly, in which case you may still use our Site, but it may interfere with some of its functionality.

## CLICKSTREAM DATA

As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each website you visit. This information, which is sometimes referred to as “clickstream data,” can be collected and stored by a website’s server. Clickstream data can tell us the type of device and browsing software you use and the address of the website from which you linked to the Site. We may collect and use clickstream data to anonymously determine how much time visitors spend on websites, how visitors navigate throughout websites and how we may tailor our Site to better meet consumer needs. This information will be used to improve our Site and our Services. Any collection or use of clickstream data will be anonymous, and will not intentionally contain any personal data.

## SECURITY AND DATA RETENTION

We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration and unauthorized disclosure or access. However, due to the inherent open nature of the Internet, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information provided online. We retain your personal information, if provided by you through the Site, for as long as your inquiry is active (as determined by us) and for a reasonable time thereafter, or if applicable, for as long as you remain on our marketing list. We also may retain your personal information for a longer period of time as needed to provide our Services to you or as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce our agreements. Even if we delete some or all of your personal information, we may continue to retain and use aggregate or anonymous data previously collected and/or anonymize or aggregate your personal information. Please note that we will not be liable for disclosures of your data due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties.

## OTHER SITES

As a convenience to you, we may provide links to third party websites from within the Site. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these third party sites, and by providing a link we are not endorsing or promoting such third party sites. When you link away from our Site, you do so at your own risk. We encourage you to read the policies and terms of every website you visit.

## SOCIAL NETWORKING SERVICES

The Site may integrate with social networking services. You understand that we do not control such services and are not liable for the manner in which they operate. While we may provide you with the ability to use such services in connection with our Site, we are doing so merely as an accommodation and, like you, are relying upon those third party services to operate properly and fairly.

You should be aware that personal information which you voluntarily include and transmit online in a publicly accessible blog, social network or otherwise online may be viewed and used by others. We are unable to control such uses of your personal information, and by using such services you assume the risk that the personal information provided by you may be viewed and used by third parties.

## INFORMATION RELATING TO CHILDREN

Our Site is designed for those 13 years of age and older. We do not knowingly collect information from anyone under the age of 13. If we are made aware that we have received such information, or any information in violation of this Privacy Policy, we will use reasonable efforts to locate and remove that information from our records.

## COMMUNICATIONS WITH REPRESENT

By providing your email address to us, you expressly consent to receive emails from us.

If you receive a promotional email from us, you may unsubscribe from promotional emails through a link, typically at the bottom of the email.

As noted above, you may opt-out of or restrict the placement of cookies on your device or remove them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences. Please note that cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on many mobile devices. However, on many mobile devices, application users may opt out of certain mobile ads via their device settings.

If you do not want us to use your personal information for our marketing purposes, send us an email at [support@represent.com](mailto:support@represent.com) stating that you withdraw your consent to such use.

## INTEREST BASED ADVERTISING OPT-OUT

We may, and may work with third parties, to use non-personal information to deliver targeted advertisements to you based upon your online activities and other information. The online advertising industry provides a service through which you may opt-out of receiving targeted ads from certain data partners and other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs. We comply with the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising set forth by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA). You can opt-out of targeted advertising from certain providers at www.aboutads.info/consumers.

Please note that by opting out, you will continue to see generic advertising that is not tailored to your specific interests and activities. To be clear, whether you are using our opt-out or an online industry opt-out, these cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted out on your device browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile device. You must separately opt out on each device.

## DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS
