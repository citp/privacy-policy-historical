The Alliance and the Action Fund each maintain an email list to keep interested parties informed about various activities of each organization through Repower America. Individuals can unsubscribe from the email lists at anytime. We collect and use your personal information to operate the Site and to deliver any services you have requested. These services may include the display of customized content based upon the information we have collected (for example, special information for users living in a particular region or state).

Only Alliance and Action Fund staff and our authorized agents have access to personally identifiable information provided by visitors to this site in order to better serve you. People who affirmatively submit their contact information through the Repower America site may be contacted by Alliance and/or Action Fund staff or authorized agents.

## IP Addresses, Log Files, and Data Analysis

As with any Web site operator, the we analyze our Web site logs to constantly improve the value of our Web site. We use an external service to provide real-time reporting to us and our authorized agents of browser accesses to our site. This includes page views, unique visitors, repeat visitors, frequency of visits, and peak-volume traffic periods. We do not use this service to gather, request, record, require, collect, or track any Internet users’ personally identifiable information.

We log IP addresses which describe the location of your computer or network on the Internet. This information is helpful for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes. We may also use third-party services such as Google Analytics. These practices help us understand traffic patterns and know if there are problems with our Web site. We may also use embedded images in emails to track open rates for our mailings. This practice helps us determine which mailings appeal most to our members.

URLs contained in emails may contain an ID that enables us to correctly identify the person who takes an action using a web page. We use URLs to simplify the process of signing petitions and filling out surveys. We may occasionally present a shortened URL that references a longer URL which contains an ID. We do this to simplify the display, to prevent links from becoming broken when copied, and to ensure compatibility with email programs which do not handle long URLs. When shortened URL is displayed in an email, you will see the full URL in the browser’s address bar when you access the page.

## Petitions and Surveys

For petitions and surveys you’ve signed or completed, we treat your name, city, state, and comments as public information – for example, we may provide compilations of petitions, with your comments, to the intended recipient of the petition or survey. We will not make your street address publicly available, but we may transmit it to the intended recipient of the petition or survey as part of the petition or survey. This is standard industry practice in such situations. In no such case will we disclose your email address or phone number, without your permission. We may also make your comments, along with your first name, city and state available to the press and public online.

## Changes to this Statement

We may occasionally update this privacy statement especially as new features are added to this Site. If there are material changes to this statement or in how we will use your personal information, we will prominently note such changes prior to their implementation. We encourage you to periodically review this page to be informed of how we are protecting your information.
