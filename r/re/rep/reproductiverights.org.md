**CENTER FOR REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS PRIVACY STATEMENT**  


The Center for Reproductive Rights ("The Center" or "we", "us", "our") shares your concern about the protection of your personal information online. This is our policy regarding the privacy of personal information we collect online in connection with the reprorights.org or reproductiverights.org website (the "Site").

**Information That We Collect and Track.** As further described below, we collect two types of information about Site visitors: (i) personal information that individual visitors provide when contributing to The Center, or voluntarily at certain other points; and (ii) tracking data, which is automatically collected from every Site visitor.

>  **Personal Information.** There are several features on our Site where allow you to volunteer personal information, such as your name, e-mail address, postal address, phone number and credit card information. For example, you may volunteer personal information when: 
> 
>   * you purchase a publication from the Site's online bookstore; 
>   * you make an online donation through the Site; or 
>   * you complete our form to subscribe to _What's New_ ( "Mailing Information"). When you complete our Mailing Information form, you will automatically receive various e-mail updates and bulletins that we send out on a periodic basis containing selected articles and other information, with hyperlinks to our Site.
> 

> 
> In addition, if you contact us, we may keep a record of your correspondence, including any personal information contained therein. A request for service, support or information may be forwarded to others as needed to respond to the request. Correspondence sent for inclusion in our newsletter or other publications may be so used (as submitted or as edited by us in our sole discretion), including related personal information (such as your name).
> 
> Wherever we collect personal information from you on the Site, we will make an effort to include a link from that Site page to this Privacy Policy. 
> 
> **Tracking Data.** Tracking data consists of information we collect automatically from each Site visitor that is not associated with an identifiable individual, such as their browser type, operating system, Internet service provider or referring site. Tracking data includes aggregate information, such as the total number of Site or page visits, and the average time visitors spend on the Site.

**How We Use the Information.** We use and disclose information obtained from visitors as stated in this Privacy Policy and as permitted by law. We will not disclose any personal information to third parties, except: 

(i) to service providers as described below;  
(ii) when we believe in good faith that the law requires it;  
(iii) to enforce our Terms of Service;  
(iv) to protect the rights, property, security or safety of The Center, Site visitors or the public;  
(v) to respond to an emergency; or  
(vi) as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy.
We use tracking data to create aggregate reports on visitor demographics and Site traffic patterns, which we use for a variety of purposes, for example, to improve the Site or to seek funding.

Unless you opt-out as provided below, The Center may send you, by postal mail or e-mail, solicitations to support The Center or particular organizations or causes.

**Surveys and Quizzes.** From time to time we invite visitors to participate in surveys and quizzes, which are typically aimed at obtaining general information regarding our community of Site visitors. Participation in these surveys and quizzes is voluntary. We may use the gathered information for a variety of purposes, for example, to improve the Site and to interact and collaborate with our Site visitors. 

**E-mail-A-Friend.** The Site provides a feature that allows visitors to inform their friends and colleagues about our Site and information contained on the Site. If you elect to use this feature, you will need to provide your e-mail address and the intended recipient's e-mail address; however, this personal information is used solely to transfer the link or web page to the recipient and is not collected or stored in our databases. 

**Service Providers.** We work with third parties who provide services such as website hosting, order processing and fulfillment, credit card clearance, data analysis, e-mailing and other, often administrative services. In general, we seek to limit such service providers to using personal information, including financial information, that is shared with them solely for the purpose of providing such services. 

**Links to Third Party Sites.** Our Site contains links to other websites operated by third parties. For example, when you use the Site's search engine, make online donations to us or purchase one of our publications online rather than downloading or printing that publication, you will link to a third party website through our Site. Such third parties may collect information about you, through cookies or other technologies, when you link to their websites through our Site. Because we do not monitor or control the information collection or privacy practices of these or any other third parties, and cannot be responsible for their practices or the content of their websites, we recommend that you review the privacy policies of such third parties to understand how they collect and use information.

**Cookies.** We do not currently use "persistent" cookies or other similar tracking technologies to collect information from Site visitors. However, as noted above, certain services provided in connection with our the Site, such as the search engine, online donations and the online bookstore, are handled by third parties that may or may not use cookies or other similar tracking technologies. Although we have chosen vendors with a reputation for security, The Center cannot control the personal information collected by those vendors and ask that you become familiar with their privacy policies. 

**Opting-In.** You may opt-in to receiving solicitations from us, and to having us disclose your personal information to like-minded organizations for purposes of contacting you regarding such organizations. You may do this whenever you provide us with personal information by checking the appropriate check box(es) on the applicable online form. If you subsequently desire to opt-out of receiving solicitations from us, and from having us disclose your personal information to like-minded organizations, you may do so by sending a request by e-mail to publications@reprorights.org or by letter to "Publications Department" at the address provided under "Contact Information" below. 

**Other communications.** From time to time, in order to best serve our community, we may e-mail Site visitors information regarding important developments affecting reproductive rights. We may also e-mail Site visitors on occasion regarding the Site and Site-related services. Such information may be sent to Site visitors even if they have not "opted-in" to receive such information.

**Viewing, Correcting or Deleting Your Personal Information.** You may view, correct or request the deletion of your personal information collected by us in connection with Site by contacting us at the e-mail address provided below. Recipients of our electronic newsletters can "unsubscribe" by following the instructions set forth in each newsletter. If you request that we delete information from our databases, we will seek to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable. Please note that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes, and there may also be residual information that will remain within our databases and other records.

We reserve the right to revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. Your continued use of the Site subsequent to changes to this Privacy Policy will mean that you accept such changes; therefore please bookmark this page and review it periodically to assure familiarity with the most current version of the Privacy Policy. You can tell that the Privacy Policy has been updated since you last reviewed it by checking the "Last Revised" date at the beginning of this Privacy Policy.

**Assignment.** In the unlikely event that we sell, transfer substantially all our assets, or merge into another organization, we reserve the right to transfer any and all information that we collect from Site visitors.

**Security.** We use reasonable security methods to protect the data that resides on our servers. However, because no security system is impenetrable, we cannot guarantee the security of our servers. It is also possible that information you supply us will be intercepted during transmission.
