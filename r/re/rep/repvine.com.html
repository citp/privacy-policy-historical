      <p class="homepagebody">You have the option to provide demographic information (such as Gender and Zip Code) to us; we encourage you to submit this information so we can provide you a more personalized experience on our site.</p>
      <p class="homepagebody">DigitalMoses LLC is the sole owner of the information collected on RepVine.com. DigitalMoses LLC collects personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on our Web site.</p>
      <p class="homepagebody"><strong>Uses of Information</strong><br>
        RepVine, a free service to manage and display your online reputation. You will be able to set up your own home page and invite your business contacts and your friends to contribute to your online reference which will add to your overall reputation. You will also be able to contribute a reference to their home page on the site.</p>
      <p class="homepagebody">We display your name, user name, bio, and picture as well as other information you elect to provide us on your home page and in the online directory. Your home page will be viewable by registered and non registered viewers of the site. We suggest that you do not include any sensitive information in your bio or in any other information that you elect to provide on your home page. All information except for email is posted for viewing by the general public. You can not opt-out of having your profile listed on the home page or on the directory as this is the primary purpose of this site. If you do not want this information displayed, you should not register on this site. If you would like to deactivate your account you may do so at <a href="/footer/contactus.php?ac=contactus">http://www.repvine.com/footer/contactus.php?ac=contactus</a></p>
      <p class="homepagebody">The additional information you elect to provide in your my profile section will be used to analyze the reputation of the people you choose to contribute to. e.g. If you contribute to user "A" reputation: When visiting user "A" reputation page on RepVine, users will be able to click on the Analyze Me link and view their references by Gender, Zip Code, Country, age group Etc.</p>
      <p class="homepagebody">We do not display your E mail address on the site.</p>
      <p class="homepagebody"><strong>Contributing To Reputations</strong><br>
        RepVine is not a social networking site, but it does revolve around community. Your RepVine is only as good as the people you choose to vouch for you. Encourage those who provide you references to have references of their own. A reference from someone who has references is more valuable than one from someone who has no one vouching for them. </p>
      <p class="homepagebody">My Profile - Tell others who you are in your own words. Share as much or as little information as you wish. This information, excluding personally identifiable information(email, birth year and zip code), will be displayed on your profile page. It is what others will read about you when they view your page. The second use is in the Analyze Me section for statistical purposes.</p>
      <p class="homepagebody">Set up your challenge phrases - This is your chance to see whether your community agrees with you or not. Enter statements that you feel describe you and/or your work. Your Connections will have the chance to agree or disagree.</p>
      <p class="homepagebody">Get references - Invite others to contribute by adding references and seeing if they agree with what you say about yourself. There are 2 ways to ask for a reference. [1)Via "Get References", located in your "My Profile": This method allows you to type individual email addresses and send them each a request, which uses your email address as the sender. 2) Via "Contribute to my Reputation", located in your "My Home Page": This will send a request to the particular RepVine user using an "@repvine.com" email address as the sender thus masking your email address.] Both methods will include a link to your "My Home Page" as well as provide a form for any comment you wish to send. Your sent and received requests will be located in your RepVine Inbox along with any private messages a user may send you.</p>
      <p class="homepagebody">Private Messages - Listed as "Send me a Message" on your RepVine Home Page. Logged in users may communicate with each other using this interface. Some people use it to verify if its a person they know, before sending a reputation request. These messages are private and not displayed to the public.</p>
      <p class="homepagebody">Can anyone add a reference? - No. You must first establish a connection before you can contribute. This means having an account and then either receiving a request from another person or asking them to contribute. Once that connection is established, the receiver approves the request, you can leave a reference and vote on challenge phrases, along with voting on other people's comments left for the particular person.</p>
      <p class="homepagebody">Once I join can I start voting and commenting on anyone I feel like - No. You must first establish a connection before you can contribute.</p>
      <p class="homepagebody">Can I change what people say - None of us are perfect, and our references will reflect that. The collective input of your community is what matters most and how we designed RepVine. (Some people will of course make simple spelling mistakes, but that will be a reflection on them and not you.) If someone says something you feel does not add value or is untrue, options do exist. Please use the Dispute option and/or contact our dispute resolution team at Dispute Resolution<br>
