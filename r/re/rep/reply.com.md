Reply S.p.A. website Privacy Policy
This page provides an outline of the way personal data of Reply website visitors is managed. This notice is
provided according to the terms of art. 13 of Italian Legislative Decree no. 196 of 30 June 2003 (hereafter
referred to as Privacy Code). This notice is addressed to all who interact via the web services provided by
Reply, accessed by electronic telecommunications means through the address: www.reply.com. This notice
only applies to the Reply S.p.A. website. It does not apply to any non-Reply sites accessed via links.
The notice also takes full account of Recommendation 2/2001 of the European personal data protection
authorities of 17 May 2001. These authorities formed the Group instituted by means of art. 29 of Directive
95/46/CE. The Group’s purpose in making their recommendation is to lay down minimum requisites for
online collection of personal data. This consists in establishing the methods and time schedules the data
processor must conform to, and the types of information data processors must provide to users accessing
web pages, irrespectively of the reasons for accessing.
Data processor
When identified or identifiable users access this site, personal data of the said users may be processed. The
data processor is Reply S.p.A. (registered office: Corso Francia 110, Torino).
Data is processed exclusively by Reply staff entrusted with this task. No personal data generated by the web
service is transferred to third parties. Personal data provided by users are used for the sole purposes of
providing requested services and performing the tasks requested. This information is transferred to third parties
only when necessary in furtherance of these interests.
Types of processed data
Navigation data
IT systems and software procedures adopted for the functioning of this website, as a part of their normal
functioning, collect various items of personal data. The said personal data is transferred as a part of the normal
course of events when using the Internet (based on TCP/IP protocol).
This information is not collected in order to be linked to the specific persons it refers to. However, its nature is
such that, through processing and collating of data held by third parties, it may be possible to identify navigating
users.
This class of information includes IP addresses or the domain names of the computers of users visiting the
website, the addresses of requested resources (in URI, Uniform Resource Identifier format), the time of the
request, the method used to forward the request to the web server, the size of the file obtained as response,
the numerical code indicating the status of the response provided by the web server (successful, error, etc...)
and other parameters relative to operating system and to user’s IT environment. This data is only to be used
for anonymous statistical information relative to use of the Reply S.p.A. website and for control of correct
functioning of the said website.
Please note that the said data may be used for investigations directed at identifying any persons responsible
for actions classed as computer crime, which are detrimental to the website of Reply S.p.A. or linked websites.
If no such investigations are conducted, the data relative to web contacts is destroyed in a few days.
Data provided voluntarily by user
When e-mail messages are voluntarily sent to the addresses indicated in the address section of Reply website,
this implies the acquisition of certain items of the requesting party’s personal data, including the requesting
party’s e-mail address (necessary for response to requests).


Cookies
The Reply website uses "cookie" technology.
For information regarding the Cookies used by the Reply website, how they are used and how to manage
them, consult the "Cookie Policy" section of this document.
Optional data provision
Apart from the above-described navigation data, users are free to provide personal information in the electronic
request forms in website sections for specific requested services. Please also note that it may not be possible
to process requests if this data is not provided.
Processing procedures and security measures
Personal data is processed by means of automated and non-automated equipment. It is processed only for no
longer than is required to fulfil tasks for which the said data was collected. Conformity with specific security
measures is ensured in order to prevent data losses, illicit or incorrect use, and unauthorized access.
Rights of concerned individuals
The individuals referred to by personal data collected in the aforementioned sections have the right, at any
time, to be informed of the existence of any such data and to be informed of content and origin of the said
data. They have the right to check it for accuracy or to request additions or updating. They also have the right
to correct such data according to the terms of art. 7 of the Privacy Code. The individuals concerned have the
right to request that the said data be deleted or rendered anonymous or, when their motives are legitimate, to
oppose processing of the said data. Requests of this nature are to be addressed to e-mail address
privacy@reply.it or sent to Reply S.p.A. - Corso Francia n. 110 - 10143 Torino.
Minors
Reply does not knowingly use its website to request data from minors or persons of less than 18 years of age.
Cookie Policy
The Reply website (hereinafter referred to as the "Website") uses Cookies to make its services simple and
effective for users visiting the portal page.
Cookies are text files, or parcels of information sent from a web server (the website www.reply.com) to the
user's browser, which are memorised on the computer and automatically returned to the server every time the
website is accessed.
There are various types of Cookie, some used to make using the Website more efficient, others to enable
certain functions. For example, Cookies can:
          •   memorise entered preferences;
          •   prevent users from having to re-enter the same information several times during their visit, for
              example username and password;
          •   analyse use of the services and contents provided by the website visited in order to optimise the
              browsing experience and services offered.


Types of Cookies used by the Reply website
The types of Cookies used by the Reply website are listed below, grouped according to their reasons for use.
Technical Cookies
This type of Cookie allows certain sections of the Website to function correctly and are essential in order to
allow the user to browse the Website and use its features. There are two categories of technical cookies:
         •    persistent: once the browser has been closed these are not cancelled, but last until a pre-defined
              expiry date;
         •    session: these are automatically cancelled each time the browser is closed.
These Cookies, always sent by the "reply.com" domain, are necessary for the correct visualisation of the
Website and, in relation to the technical services offered, will therefore always be used and sent (unless the
user modifies the settings in his or her browser). Included in this category are the persistent Cookies used to
allow the user to register with the Website and access its restricted area.
The aforementioned Cookies used by the Website avoid the need to use other data processing techniques
which could potentially reduce the confidentiality of the users' navigation of the website, and do not permit the
acquisition of identifying personal information regarding the user.
Functionality Cookies
The Cookies in this category are used to memorise certain settings selected by the user, in order to remember
their preferences during future visits.
These Cookies can have the duration of a session but they are generally persistent and sent from the
"reply.com" domain. They may also be used when providing a service not explicitly requested by, but provided
to the user.
The information gathered by these cookies is anonymous and cannot track the user's behaviour on other
websites.
Included in this category, for example, are Cookies used primarily to memorise the user's preferences
regarding the country of origin and therefore the language in which the text of the Website is viewed.
Performance Cookies
The cookies in this category (which also include so-called "Cookie analytics") are used to gather information
regarding use of the website.
The Reply website uses this information to obtain anonymous statistical analyses in order to improve use of
its Website and to adapt its contents to the desires of its visitors. This type of Cookie gathers information
anonymously regarding the user's activity and how he or she arrived at the Website.
Analytical cookies may be sent from the Website itself (so-called "first-party" Cookies) but they are generally
sent from third party domains / websites (so-called "third-party" Cookies).
Included in this category, for example, are Web Analytics, where the data gathered is limited to use of the
website by the user and the number of accesses to the website, in order to manage the performance and
structure of the website. These cookies are generally persistent.


Cookies to integrate products and software functions from third parties
This type of Cookie integrates functions developed by third parties into the pages of the Website such as icons
and preferences expressed on social networks (for example, Facebook, Twitter) in order to share the contents
of the Website or for the use of third party software services (such as software to generate maps and other
software offering additional services). These Cookies are sent by third party domains and partner websites,
which therefore offer their features within the pages of the Website.
Third party cookies for marketing / retargeting
The Cookies in this category are only third-party and are used to create user profiles in order to send
advertising messages or present advertising banners for the Website when the user is browsing on other
websites, in line with the preferences demonstrated by the user within the pages of the Website.
The Reply website does not use first-party profiling cookies.
The user's consent
According to regulations, the Reply website is not obliged to request consent for first-party technical and
analytical Cookies, as they are necessary in order to provide the services requested. They are therefore
installed automatically by the Website during the user's first visit to any page of the portal.
For other types of Cookie, consent is requested via a pop-up banner: this implies active behaviour on the part
of the user, meaning that the latter can give his or her consent by clicking on the "OK" button.
For all other types of Cookie the user can give his or her consent by one or more of the following means:
         •    via specific browser settings used to browse the pages that form the Website (see the following
              section);
         •    via modifications to the settings for the use of third party services.
Please note that certain areas or features of the Website rely on the use of Cookies, meaning that disabling
Cookies using one of the solutions indicated above could prevent the user from visualising certain parts of the
Website correctly or using specific features offered by the Website (for example authentication and access to
the restricted area of the website).
How to manage the Cookies used by the Reply website through browser configuration
Nearly all internet browsers are set up to automatically accept Cookies. The user can modify the predefined
configuration (generally set to "medium" level) and disable Cookies, selecting from the form provided (generally
entitled "Privacy") the highest level of protection. In all cases, the user also has the opportunity to delete
individual Cookies from his or her computer by going to "Internet Options", Tools menu and selecting the
"General" form and clicking the appropriate deletion button.
