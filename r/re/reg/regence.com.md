Consumer Privacy Notice

**

We are committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information. The purpose of this notice is to inform you of the types of personal information we obtain and how we protect that information.

**

What is personal information?

**

We treat any information that is identifiable to you as your personal information, whether or not it may be otherwise available to the public. We collect personal information related to your:

  * Health condition, including health care treatment and payment;
  * Identity, such as your name, age, or address; and
  * Income, when necessary for coverage.

**

Why do we collect your personal information?

**

We collect personal information from you to help us:

  * Determine the appropriate products to offer you;
  * Pay claims;
  * Provide case management services; and
  * Provide quality improvement services.

**

How do we collect your personal information?

**

We collect your personal information through you and your health care providers. For example, we receive personal information from you on your insurance application and from your health care providers through insurance transactions, such as the submission of a claim for reimbursement of covered benefits.

**

To whom do we disclose your personal information?

**

We will not disclose your personal information unless we are allowed or required by law to make the disclosure, or if you give us permission. Following are some examples of disclosures we may make as allowed or required by law:

  * To health care providers (doctors and others who provide you with care) in connection with an insurance transaction, such as verifying that you have coverage;
  * To service companies that perform insurance functions on our behalf, such as third party administrators, insurance agents, auditors, benefit consultants, or care management specialists for utilization management and quality improvement;
  * To an insurance regulatory authority; or
  * To respond to legal requests such as a subpoena.



We will not disclose your personal information to any non-affiliated company for that company’s marketing purposes.

We may share your financial information with our affiliated companies for marketing purposes to better serve your needs as one of our customers. Financial information means information about your income or your identity, such as your name, age, or address. An affiliated company means a company owned or controlled by us. For example, if you choose to purchase insurance from us, we may share your financial information with an affiliated life insurance company to make our full range of insurance products and services available to you. Also, when you reach a certain age, we may share your financial information with an affiliate to alert you of additional products or programs for which you may become eligible, such as Medicare or Medicaid.

**

How do we protect your personal information?

**

We protect your personal information by:

  * Treating all of your personal information that we collect as confidential;
  * Stating confidentiality policies and practices in our employee handbooks as well as disciplinary measures for privacy violations;
  * Restricting access to your personal information only to those employees who need to know your personal information in order to provide our services to you, such as paying a claim for a covered benefit;
  * Only disclosing your personal information that is necessary for a service company to perform its function on our behalf, and the company agrees to protect and maintain the confidentiality of your personal information;
  * Maintaining physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal and state regulations to guard your personal information.

**

Can I "opt out " of certain disclosures?

**

You may have received notices from other organizations that allow you to "opt out" of certain disclosures. The most common type of disclosure that applies to "opt outs" is the disclosure of personal information to a non-affiliated company so that company can market its products or services to you. As a health plan, we must follow many federal and state laws that prohibit us from making these types of disclosures. Because we do not make disclosures that apply to "opt outs," it is not necessary for you to complete an "opt out" form or take any action to restrict such disclosures.
