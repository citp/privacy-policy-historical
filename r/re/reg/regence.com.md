**ONLINE PRIVACY AND SECURITY**

At Regence, protecting your personal information is important to us. Whether you are a current customer or just visiting this Site, we are as committed to protecting the information you provide through this Web site as when you provide it to us over the phone, in person or through the mail. However, we recognize, and want you to recognize, that while electronic communications have many benefits, they are not as secure as other means of communication. Please read the following information carefully to better understand how using this Site affects your privacy.

**Security Practices.**  
Regence attempts to protect online information according to applicable laws and established company security standards and practices. We have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information under our control, and we continually evaluate new technologies for safeguarding your information. However, we cannot guarantee the confidentiality or security of electronic transmissions via the Internet because they may potentially use unsecure computers and links, and data may be lost or intercepted by unauthorized parties during such transmission. If you wish to submit personal or confidential information by a more secure means of communication, please contact us.

Sensitive information you provide to us online is protected by Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. SSL is the leading security protocol for data transfer on the Internet. This technology scrambles your account information as it moves between your PC's browser and Regence's computer systems. When information is scrambled, or encrypted in this way, it becomes nearly impossible for anyone other than Regence to read it. This secure session helps protect the safety and confidentiality of your information when you interact with Regence online.

**Cookies.**  
A cookie is a small text file that the Regence system sends to your computer to collect information about your activities on this Site, or to make it possible for you to purchase products or services from this Site and to track such purchases. The cookie transmits this information back to this Site each time your browser requests a page from this Site, and the information is stored to help facilitate your use of this Site the next time you visit. In addition to information you provide, Regence may use cookies or other passive means to collect general information such as: the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet; the IP address of the computer you are using; the browser and operating system you are using; the date and time you access this Site; and the Internet address of the Web site from which you linked to this Site.

Regence uses cookies so you won't have to reenter information each time you visit this Site. If you do not want to receive cookies from this Site, you can set your browser to not accept cookies.

**Use of E-Mail.**  
Please use your own best judgment when sending information via the Internet to an e-mail address. E-mail sent via the Internet may pass through private and public networks with varying levels of security. Some networks may have taken steps to secure e-mail transmissions while others have not, thereby compromising the privacy and integrity of an e-mail. An e-mail may be copied, altered or destroyed. Regence will respect your request not to be contacted by e-mail.

Once your e-mail is received, Regence preserves the content of your e-mail, your e-mail address and our response so we can efficiently respond to questions you might have. We also do this in an effort to meet legal and regulatory requirements.

**Updates to the Statement.**  
Evolving technology will continue to provide Regence with new and better ways to safeguard your information. We may update this statement in the future to reflect these technological advances, and we encourage you to return to this page from time to time for any updates.
