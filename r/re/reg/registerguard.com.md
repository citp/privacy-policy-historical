**_Last Updated on September 10, 2014._**

This Privacy Statement applies to all information collected by Guard Publishing Company dba Register-Guard (“The Register-Guard,” “we,” “our,” “us”), including information collected from registerguard.com; through e-mail newsletters published or distributed by The Register-Guard; by applications owned by The Register-Guard; over the telephone; and to information collected through any other online or offline interactive features, services, and communications owned or controlled by The Register-Guard (collectively, “Our Services”).

**WHAT INFORMATION MAY BE COLLECTED ABOUT YOU**

1\. Personal information that you provide to us.

Personal information is any information that can be used to individually identify you, such as your name, e-mail address, physical address, phone number, or any other identifier that allows us to interact with you directly by phone, mail or electronically. Generally, you can use many of Our Services without providing your personal information to us, and if you do not want to share your personal information, you should not use any of Our Services that ask for that information. However, there are a number of situations in which you may supply us with your personal information. The following are the three most common of those situations:

  * **Direct Collection:** We may require that you provide personal information to us in order to use certain optional parts of Our Services. For example, you may have to provide personal information when you enter a sweepstakes or contest; complete a survey; register for certain services; sign up to receive e-mails related to Our Services; request customer service; make an online purchase; apply for a job with us; or subscribe to our publication. The personal information that we may require includes, among other things, your name, username, password, e-mail address, street address, phone number, mobile phone number, gender, date of birth, and credit card and other billing information. 

To use some of our optional services, you may also have to provide another person’s personal information to us. For example, many of our online news article pages include an option to refer or send the page's content to other people via e-mail. To provide this service, we must collect and log e-mail addresses of the person referring the story and the person(s) receiving the referral. Our online news article pages can also be shared through social media and other platforms provided through Our Services. Please see the [“Personal information collected through social media and other platforms for sharing web content” section below](https://web.archive.org/web/20171214222924id_/http://projects.registerguard.com/pages/privacy-statement/personal-information-collected-through-social-media-and-other-platforms-for-sharing-web-content) for more information on sharing articles through social media platforms. 

  * **Personal information that you voluntarily disclose to other users:** You may decide to share personal information with other users when using certain parts of Our Services even though you are not required by us to do so. We offer you opportunities to engage in public activities through Our Services, including the ability to post comments about our stories through a third-party service called Disqus. The personal information that you share when engaging in those activities may be seen by anyone else using Our Services and may be collected and used by us in accordance with this Privacy Statement, by Disqus, and by other users. For example, when you post a comment about a story on our website, your screen name or ID is visible and you could choose to include your name or location as part of the comment, which can be viewed, collected, and used by other visitors to the site and by us. You must follow our Terms of Use (located at: <http://projects.registerguard.com/pages/terms-of-use/>) when using Our Services to post any information, and we strongly recommend that you not include personal information in your postings. Your use of the comment feature is also subject to Disqus, Inc.’s terms and policies, available here: <https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/topics/215159-terms-and-policies/articles>. 
  * **Personal information collected through social media and other platforms for sharing web content:** Our Services allow access to a suite of social media and web content sharing platforms provided by AddThis, Inc. on many of our online news article pages. When you use social media platforms, such as Facebook, Google+, Twitter, Tumblr, LinkedIn, or Blogger, in connection with your use of Our Services, we may collect personal information that you make available to us through those social media and content sharing platforms, including your account ID. We will only collect and use that information to the extent that such collection and use is permitted under the privacy policies of the social media platform. You should review the privacy policies of the social media platform before using it in connection with Our Services. The collection and use of your information resulting from your use of social media and content sharing features through AddThis is governed by this Privacy Statement and subject to AddThis’s privacy policy, which is located here: <http://www.addthis.com/privacy/privacy-policy>. You can opt-out of AddThis data collection here: <http://www.addthis.com/privacy/opt-out>. 



**Wherever there is an opportunity for you to provide us with personal information, we will make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Statement on that page so that you will have easy access to review our policies.**

2\. Non-personal information passively collected through technology.

Non-personal information includes information that does not personally identify you, but it may include tracking and usage information about your computer’s or mobile device’s location, your demographics, and your use of Our Services and the Internet. Like most websites, we collect and log non-personal information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to you, including cookies, service logs, and other similar technologies.

  * **Cookies and similar technologies:** Our Services may use “cookies,” Web beacons, and other similar technologies to track how many times an ad is delivered (impressions) and how many times it is clicked (click-throughs). Cookies may also be used to track other online activity by users of Our Services in order to serve specific advertising within standard ad units (such as behavioral or geographic data). Parts of Our Services also may use cookies to enable you to keep "favorites" lists, or to save you time in re-entering frequently used information, such as in login procedures. You may be able to opt-out of the cookies delivered by Our Services by changing the settings on your Internet browser. Disabling cookies, however, may substantially limit your ability to interact or access Our Services. Depending on your privacy settings, please be aware that this may disable all cookies delivered to your browser, not just the ones delivered by Our Services.
  * **Device information:** We may collect non-personal information about the computer, mobile device, or other device you use to access Our Services, such as IP address, geolocation information, unique device identifiers, browser type, browser language, and other transactional information.
  * **IP addresses:** We may collect and use your device’s IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer Our Services. Your device’s IP address may disclose the location of your device when you access Our Services. We may use your device’s IP address to help identify you as a unique visitor to our site and to gather broad information about your site usage.



A. INFORMATION COLLECTED BY THIRD PARTIES

In some areas of Our Services, we have contracted with third-party technology or content providers (“Content Providers”) to provide certain information and services to users. An example of a page within Our Services provided by a Content Provider is The Register-Guard Jobs page, the content of which is provided by Adicio. In other areas of Our Services, we have entered into partnerships with other companies (“Partners”) who provide services on co-branded web pages. On these pages, the Partner’s brand is clearly visible. An example of a co-branded page on our site is the obituaries page from Legacy.com.

We may share information with Content Providers and Partners, and those Content Providers or Partners may otherwise collect information from your use of Our Services. For example, you may also be asked by a Content Provider or Partner to create a separate registration account and, thereby, share personal information with such Content Provider or Partner. Be aware that the information collected and used by a Content Provider or Partner may be subject to that specific Content Provider’s or Partner’s privacy policy and terms of service, rather than this Privacy Statement and our Terms of Use. We recommend that you review the privacy policy of each third-party service provider with whom you interact and each website you visit before submitting information to them.

Third-party advertisers on Our Services may use cookies, Web Beacons, or similar technologies to collect non-personal information about our users. We do not have control over their collection and use of your information, and their actions are subject to their own privacy policy, not this Privacy Statement. You may be able to opt-out of the cookies delivered by advertisers by changing the settings on your Internet browser. For more information about opting out of certain advertisers’ collection of information through electronic means, choose among the following:

  * If you would like more information about advertisers' use of cookies, and about your option not to accept these cookies, please click <http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/>.
  * If you would like to opt-out of having interest-based information collected during your visits to this or other sites, please click <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>.



CHILDREN'S GUIDELINES

Our Services are not intended for use by children, especially those under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If you are under 13 years of age, you should not provide personal information to us. If we discover that we have received any personal information from a child under 13, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe we have any information from or about anyone under 13, please contact us at the address listed below.

HOW YOUR INFORMATION IS USED BY US

1\. Providing and customizing Our Services.

We use personal information you supply to provide you with the merchandise, product, service, or content that you have requested. We also use your personal information to customize certain features of Our Services to provide you with an enhanced experience, including, among other things, allowing targeted advertising to the users for whom the advertising would be most pertinent. The following are examples of these uses of your information:

  * **Subscriber Account Registration:** If you subscribe to any of Our Services, we may use your e-mail address to send you a confirmation notice and your mailing address for location verification. If you make changes to your subscriber account settings, change your password, place a vacation hold, or make a payment, we may use your e-mail address to send you a confirmation notice. We may also use the information to communicate with you about new features, products, or services, or to improve the services that we offer by tailoring them to your needs.
  * **Order Forms:** Our sites use order forms for customers to request information, products, and services. On these forms, we may collect your personal information, which may be used for billing, to process orders, to contact you about your order, and to notify you about subscriber benefits or promotions that we may offer.
  * **Surveys:** Our online surveys may ask customers for contact and demographic information. The customer's contact information is used to contact the customer when necessary. Demographic information may be used to tailor our customers' experience at our sites. Survey data may be published on Our Services or in our newspaper, The Register-Guard. It may also be used to develop content and to support marketing for Our Services or for The Register-Guard. Unique identifiers may be collected and used to verify a customer's identity.



2\. Statistical analysis.

We perform statistical, demographic, and marketing analyses of users of Our Services, and their subscribing and purchasing patterns, for product development purposes and to generally inform advertisers about the nature of our subscriber base. We use this information for analysis purposes, including analysis to improve customer relationships. The following are examples of this use:

  * **Story Referrals:** We use logs of the e-mail addresses involved in a story referral to track general patterns of reader usage and to determine which stories are being referred to others. We will not knowingly provide any e-mail addresses collected by us in this process to any third parties for commercial or advertising purposes.
  * **Contests:** We may run contests on our sites in which we ask customers for information so that we may contact them if necessary regarding the contest. We may collect this information directly, or it may be collected through a third party service. For example, we sometimes use Google Forms (powered by Google Docs) for contest enrollment. Personal information collected by Google is subject to Google’s privacy policy and terms of service. Google’s policies are located here: <https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies>. Personal information obtained from contestants may be used to compile aggregate information about site usage and demographics.



3\. Promotions and e-mail newsletters.

If you have given us permission, we may use your personal information to periodically send you e-mail newsletters or promotional e-mails about services offered by The Register-Guard. You may withdraw your consent to receive promotional e-mails by simply following the unsubscribe option at the bottom of the e-mail. You may also opt-out by e-mailing us at rg.onlineads@registerguard.com, or by mail to The Register-Guard, Attn: Webmaster, 3500 Chad Drive, Eugene, OR 97408. If you are a current newspaper subscriber, please remember to include your account number and phone number in the body of your e-mail or letter, and if you choose to opt-out via e-mail, please include "Opt-out" in the subject line.

4\. e-Edition.

In our e-Edition, we give you the option to sign up for story alerts by clicking on the “e-notify” button from within the e-Edition website and completing the online submission form. If you decide you no longer want to receive these alerts, or you want to change the types of stories we are sending you alerts about, you may make changes to your customer settings by clicking on the “e-notify” button from within the e-Edition website and either selecting the “deactivate” button or the ”update search” button.

5\. Compliance.

We may also use your personal information to detect and investigate activities that may violate any law or any of our rules or policies, including our Terms of Use (located at: <http://projects.registerguard.com/pages/terms-of-use/>).

HOW YOUR INFORMATION IS SHARED WITH OTHERS

1\. Personal information.

Except as provided in this Privacy Statement, we will not sell, rent, swap, or authorize any third party to use your e-mail address or any other personal information without your permission. However, we may share your personal information in the following situations:

The use of that information will be governed by their privacy policies or practices. This is completely optional.
  * **Service providers:** We contract with other companies to provide services on our behalf, including credit card and billing processing, shipping, e-mail distribution, list processing, subscriber services, newsletter services, e-Edition hosting and related services, and analytics or promotions management. We provide these companies only with the information they need to perform their services, and they are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality of that information.

  * **Mergers and other business transactions:** In the future, we may sell, buy, merge, or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, we may include your information among the transferred assets.
  * Third party direct marketing: We do not share your personal information with third parties for direct marketing purposes.



2\. Non-personal information.

We may disclose or share non-personal information in an aggregated and de-identified form in any other manner that we deem appropriate or necessary.

We may also disclose non-personal, de-identified information to our partners and other third parties, including advertisers.

We have security measures in place at our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of personal information collected from you.
