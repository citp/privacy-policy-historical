The Register strongly believes in the importance of keeping readers' personal information personal. It will never use your information for any use beyond that stated or the permissions you give us.

### IP Addresses and Server Logs

The Register site does record IP addresses and produces server logs - as all Web Servers do. This information is used solely for monitoring the volume of traffic the site receives and measuring the number of readers. We do not use the information for tracking the activities of specific visitors to the site.

### Cookies

The Register site sets cookies in order to help with the management of its advertising and to enable certain user features, such as account login. The data is used by our Advertising Server to help decide which adverts to display on the page at any given time. You may of course choose to block these cookies if you wish, and the majority of the site will continue to function normally.

### Advertising

The Register runs advertising for a wide variety of organisations. These adverts are served from our advertising servers as well as from third-party ad servers managed by the advertiser. Recent third-party ad servers include DoubleClick, Atlas DMT and BlueStreak

These ad servers may attempt to set cookies on your computer. All these sites stress that information gathered through these cookies is used purely for the purpose of advert delivery, recording and segmentation. They do not use information gathered through their cookies for their own use, and they do not collect any personally identifiable information.

The respective privacy policies of these ad servers can be found here :

[DoubleClick Privacy Policy](http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/)   
DoubleClick also has a cookie opt-out facility [here](http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/ad-cookie/)
