The Register strongly believes in the importance of keeping readers' personal information personal. It will never use your information for any use beyond that stated or the permissions you give us.

The Register may collect, process and use your personal data (including your name, postal address, email address, telephone, mobile and fax numbers). We will do so to contact you regarding the services you have requested and/or to offer services to you, and/or to provide the services you have requested. This includes re-registration/renewal notifications, payment processing, surveys on improving our service to you and/or invitations to exhibitions, seminars and shows. The Register may employ trusted third party specialists to process and use your data on our behalf in order to deliver the products and services to you in a more efficient manner.

### IP Addresses and Server Logs

The Register site does record IP addresses and produces server logs - as all Web Servers do. This information is used solely for monitoring the volume of traffic the site receives and measuring the number of readers. We do not use the information for tracking the activities of specific visitors to the site.

### Cookies

The Register site sets cookies in order to help with the management of its advertising and to enable certain user features. Read all about our cookies, and how to manage them [here](https://web.archive.org/Profile/cookies/).

### Advertising

The Register runs advertising for a wide variety of organisations. These adverts are served from our advertising servers as well as from third-party advertising servers managed by the advertiser. Recent third-party ad servers include DoubleClick, Atlas DMT and MediaMind.

These ad servers may attempt to set cookies on your computer. All these sites stress that information gathered through these cookies is used purely for the purpose of advert delivery, recording and segmentation. They do not use information gathered through their cookies for their own use, and they do not collect any personally identifiable information.

The respective privacy policies of these ad servers can be found here:

[DoubleClick Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/privacy-policy.html)

DoubleClick also has a cookie opt-out facility [here](http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/)

### Email and Online Forms

Readers who choose to subscribe to our headlines-by-email service, or complete any of our online forms, may be asked to supply personal data. If they choose to do so, that information is recorded and used for broad demographic information, which may be used to target advertising. If permission is granted, this information may be used to target specific users with occasional emails informing them about commercial services provided by The Register.

If permission is granted, this information may be used to send occasional emails containing offers from our partners. This will only ever be provided to readers who have specifically given us permission to use their information in this way.

The Register will never use your data for anything beyond the reason stated and the permissions you grant us. To alter the emails which you receive from us, including unsubscribing from all email communications, please [visit this page](http://account.theregister.co.uk/). Make sure that you enter exactly the same e-mail address as you used to sign up.

Register journalists may use your email address to reply to comments that you have posted on our website.

### Competitions

Readers who enter The Register competitions will be asked for some personal information, but only to allow us to judge the validity of their applications and to contact them should they be declared a competition winner.

If permission is granted, this information may be used to target specific users with commercial services provided by The Register.

If permission is granted, this information may be used to send occasional emails from The Register containing offers from our partners. This will only ever be provided to readers that have specifically given us permission to use their information in this way.

The Register will never use your data for anything beyond the reason stated and the permissions you grant us.

### Mobile Apps

When using comments through The Register mobile apps, login details that are entered within the app are submitted to The Register’s servers and the IP address of all communication with the servers is logged. This IP information is used anonymously in aggregate for generating site statistics, and for ensuring our services are not abused. We do not process login information for any further purpose.

### Publishing

We reserve the right to publish emails and letters sent to The Register. If the sender asks that that we don't reveal his or her identity, that information won't be published. We never publish a private email address unless specifically asked to do so by its owner.
