<h1 class="title bold text-center">Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
This Privacy Policy describes how ReGlobe ("we" or "us") gathers and uses personal information 

submitted on our website www.ReGlobe.in (ReGlobe). It also describes the choices available to you 

regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information.
</p>
<p>
ReGlobe strives to give the best offers to sell your old gadget; then ReGlobe refers you to a buyer for 

your product. ReGlobe will share your personal information with these carefully selected buyers when 

you agree to submit for a quote. This means we do not take your credit card/debit card information and 

we do not take your money. Registration on ReGlobe is voluntary, if you do decide to register; we will 

not share your personal information until you agree to submit to a quote. You do get access to certain 

features if you register, but membership is not necessary to find sale offers. If you have questions or 

complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact us.
</p>
<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>
We collect standard information about ReGlobe users such as IP addresses, browser type, operating 

system, what you searched for, referring and exit pages, the dates and times of visits, and other site 

usage behavior ("Site Visitation Data"). Site Visitation Data is used to administer the site and provide 

general statistics regarding the use of the ReGlobe website. We may also use Site Visitation Data to 

display advertising or send targeted email marketing messages you may find interesting and to suppress 

advertising that might not interest you.
</p>
<p>
To help improve our site and services, we may collect certain technical information from your browser 

software, screen resolution and the website that referred you to us.
</p>
<h2>Sharing information with friends and in user forums</h2>
<p>
The ReGlobe website allows you to share certain information with friends that you select. Please bear 

in mind that ReGlobe.in cannot control what your friends do with the information you share with 

them, so you should only share with friends you trust. Once displayed on publicly viewable web pages, 

information that you share can be collected and used by others. To request removal of your personal 

information from our blog or community forum, please contact us at info@reglobe.in. In some cases, 

we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are 

unable to do so and why.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, if you participate in a user forum on the ReGlobe.in website, your comments and

your ReGlobe.in username will be displayed to all ReGlobe.in users on the forum. ReGlobe.in is not 

responsible for what any user or third party may do with information that you choose to share.
</p>
<p>
We may also provide a feature allowing you to invite a friend to join ReGlobe.in. If you provide a friend's

email address to us for this reason, we will use that email address only for the purpose of sending 

a onetime invitation to your friend. Your friend may contact us at info@reglobe.in to remove their 

information from our database.
</p>

<h2>Use of personal information</h2>

<p>We will treat your personal information as confidential, and we will not share your personal information 

with third parties without your permission, except in the limited circumstances described below.

If you accept a referral from ReGlobe.in to one of our partner sites, we may provide PII to the partner 

site to save you having to re-enter that information. When you select a partner site to sell your phone 

to, you must opt in to allow your PII to be submitted to that partner site, and you agree to be bound by 

their privacy policy as regards use of your PII.
</p>

<p>
We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our 

business activities such as fulfilling your request for a free shipping kit, purchasing your phone, or 

sending confirmation or other emails. These companies are authorized to use your personal information 

only as necessary to provide these services to us.
</p>
<p>
We may provide your personal information to our third party marketing partners so they may offer you 

goods and services which you may find of interest. If you do not wish to receive offers from these third 

parties, you may unsubscribe from their mailing lists by following the instructions in the offer. If you 

respond to any such offer, your information will be subject to that third party's privacy policy.

We may disclose your personal information when we reasonably believe that it is required by a law or 

legal process and to protect and defend the rights and interests of ReGlobe, its affiliates, suppliers, or 

users. In the event ReGlobe goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by 

another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, 

be part of the assets transferred.
</p>
<p>

We may use and disclose your aggregated usage information with others, in a form that does not 

identify any individual, to allow ReGlobe and our advertisers to present targeted advertising to you. We 

may disclose to third parties, including advertisers and potential business partners, aggregated statistics 

that we develop from your usage habits, preferences, and history. For example, we may disclose 

generalized information about usage habits based on aggregated statistics developed from your site 

usage behavior and search history. This statistical information will not identify any individual.
</p>

<h2>Control of personal information</h2>
<p>
You can confirm, change, delete or update personal information you have provided to us by contacting 

us at info@reglobe.in.
</p>
<p>
When you opt-out of promotional communications from us, you may still receive service messages (such 

as an order confirmation) and legally mandated notices and third party marketing messages

Please note that, even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account, copies 

of that information may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent it has been shared with others, it was 

otherwise distributed pursuant to your privacy settings, or it was copied or stored by other users. We 

will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. 

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve 

disputes, and enforce our agreements.
</p>
<h2>Security of personal information</h2>
<p>
The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted standards 

to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. 

However, no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is one hundred 

percent secure and we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Please contact us, if you have any 

questions about security on our site.
</p>
<h2>Protection of children's privacy</h2>
<p>
We do not knowingly collect any PII from people under the age of 13. If we become aware that a child 

under 13 is attempting to submit this information, we will inform the minor that he or she is ineligible to 

do so. We will then remove this information from our records.
</p>
<h2>Use of cookies and tracking technology</h2>
<p>

site visitation data by tracking how users navigate to and through our website. We may also use this 

technology to track the delivery of HTML email messages. Data collected through this mechanism is not 

linked to personal information.
</p>
<p>

browser or operating system software. You can enable your browser to refuse cookies, but doing so may 

disable access to some services and tools that we offer.
</p>
<p>
ReGlobe works with advertising partners to place advertising on our site. Our third party advertising 

partners often use a cookie or third party web beacon to track when a click becomes a sale. No PII is 

ever sent to these advertising partners.
</p>

<p>
The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers is not covered 

by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our partners, affiliates, 

tracking utility company, service providers use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate 

our site.
</p>

<p>
We use Java script to gather email address entered into the site. When you enter an email address onto 

the site, we may send periodical reminder emails to that address about items left in a cart. You may opt-
out of these emails by following the unsubscribe link in an email.
