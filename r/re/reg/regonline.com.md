**Information Collection & Uses **  
_Types of Users_ We have two different types of users of the site and it’s services. The type of user you are will determine the collection and use policies of your information. The first type is a client. A client is a RegOnline customer that is using the services we provide to create a registration form for an event. They are a company or an individual using the software and services from RegOnline to run and manage an event. The other type of user is an attendee. An attendee is a person signing up for an event through a registration page created by our services and software by a client. The types of information collected and the use of that information is detailed below.   
_Attendee information collected by RegOnline_ All attendee data that is collected and maintained through our service is solely owned by the client, and we have no rights to sell or use the information provided. The client, not RegOnline, is responsible for what information is collected and required on the registration forms. We will provide and maintain the secure storage of all information collected from the attendee and will not sell, use or rent the information collected to any third party.   
_Client information collected by RegOnline_ Clients purchasing service through RegOnline will be required to provide certain personally identifiable information. This will include personal information (such as name, email, phone, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit number and expiration date). This information from clients is collected when a client signs up for a live demo, opens a new account, or calls and starts a new account over the phone.   
The information collected is used for billing purposes and to send orders to the client or other involved third parties. If we have trouble relaying the order or the client cannot fill an order, the information provided will be used to contact the client. RegOnline does not share, rent, or sell this information to any third parties.   
_Attendee information collected by client’s registration pages_ Attendee information that is collected by RegOnline’s service is the sole property of the client. The client will decide what information will be required and collected as well as how they will use the information. RegOnline is responsible for safe and secure storage of all information collected but will not have any rights to sell or use the information provided.   
_Surveys_ From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information (such as demographic information, e-mail, phone, and address) from you. Participation in these surveys are completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.   
We use the information gathered in the survey to better personalize our service, improve the ease-of-use of our website, or to get customer feedback on changes or improvements that we have made. These surveys are conducted in-house. We will not share the personally identifiable information provided through your survey with any other third party unless we give you prior notice and choice.   
_Tell-A-Friend_ If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site with a link to our site. RegOnline does not store this information. The information collected is for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email to visit our site.  
_Forums_ If you use the forums on this site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.  We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.  
_Testimonials_ _From time to time we receive and post testimonials from our valued customers on our site.   We receive permission to post these testimonials prior to posting on the site. If you would like your testimonial removed, please contact us at [support@regonline.com](mailto:support@regonline.com) . _  
_Uses of Information_  
RegOnline offers its online event registration service to clients as a means of collecting and managing attendee and/or vendor registrations. Any information provided on a registration page is the sole property of the client, kept on RegOnline's servers and is accessible only to the authorized client or to RegOnline at the direct request of the authorized client. If an attendee wants to find out how the client will be using their information the attendee should see the client’s privacy statement or contact the client directly.   
RegOnline, under the discretion of the client, will use the clients e-mail address provided to send secondary communications such as newsletter to the client. The client can “opt-out” of these secondary communications when they sign up for an account or can be removed from the list by following the instructions on the newsletter in-order to get removed. RegOnline will not use attendee’s information for any secondary communication unless authorized by the client.   
**Communications from the Site**  
_Customer Service_  
Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will communicate with you in response to your inquiries in order to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email or telephone, in accordance with your wishes.   
We do not share your profile with other third parties except as described in this privacy statement.    
**Information Sharing and Disclosure**  
_Choice/Opt-out_ Attendees providing personally identifiable information will need to refer to the client and their privacy policies regarding the opportunity to “opt-out” of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes (such as newsletters and other marketing materials). We are not responsible for “opt-out” opportunities for attendees as attendee’s personally identifiable information is the sole property of our client. We provide the secure storage and software to obtain the information but will not share or use attendee information for any purpose, unless otherwise indicated by our client.   
Clients submitting their information will have the opportunity to “opt-out” of their personally identifiable information being used to send secondary communications from us, such as newsletters. This option will be available when clients are opening a new account. If you currently receive our newsletter and other secondary communications, clients will have the option to “opt-out” of receiving that material by either following the instructions on the secondary communication material to be taken off the list or clients may [Send an email to us](mailto:support@regonline.com) at [support@regonline.com](mailto:support@regonline.com) .   
_Co-Branded Relationships_ We have a co-branded relationship with our clients whereby, clients use the software and service we provide to create an online registration form and all personally identifiable information that attendees enter into these forms is solely owned by the client. The client is the user of the information attendees provide and all attendees should refer to the client directly or the client’s privacy statement for disclosure on use of the submitted information. RegOnline’s role is providing the online registration service and safely maintaining the storage of the information but is not responsible for the client’s use of the information.

We DO NOT Share Personally Identifiable Information with Third Parties, except as otherwise indicated in this privacy statement.   
_Access to Personally Identifiable Information_ Attendees who have changes to their personally identifiable information or would like to cancel their registration can either log in to the registration page using their ID number (given to the attendee through a confirmation e-mail after registering for an event with a RegOnline client) or can simply type in your email address to the registration form. Either of these entries will bring up the personally identifiable information the attendee has previously entered for that registration form and the attendee will have the option of either updating or canceling their registration.   
At the minimum, we will provide a response within 30 days to a request for access to personally identifiable information collected.
