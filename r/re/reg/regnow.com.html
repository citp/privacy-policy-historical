<p><b>Cookies and WebBeacons </b></p>
<p>We may use “Cookies” and other tracking technologies such as web beacons. “Cookies” are small text files that are transferred to your computer’s hard disk by the website.      Digital River’s cookies are used to identify a computer or browser, not to identify specific customer traits. If you do not want cookies in your browser, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to notify you when a website attempts to place a cookie in your browser. </p>
<p>WebBeacons (also referred to as GIF files, pixels or action tags) help Digital River recognize a unique cookie on your browser.  We use this tool to compile aggregate information about you, and it is not personally identifiable.  This information includes IP addresses, search terms, domain names, and browser types. We use this information to track usage and other patterns on our Websites. We may share this aggregate information with our partners or service providers.</p>
<p><b>Sharing Personal Information</b></p>
<p>Digital River may receive personally identifiable information either from you directly or from our partner or supplier who provides us with the personal information to fulfill a service to you on their behalf. In some circumstances, personal information that Digital River receives from you directly may be provided to our partners or suppliers in order for them to fulfill a service to us for your benefit or directly to you.

We do use companies to process credit card payments, deliver packages, send mail, analyze data, provide marketing aid and assistance, provide customer service, and otherwise provide services to us to enable us to serve you and enhance our services. These organizations may have access to personal information as required to permit them to perform their obligations to us.

<p>Digital River may be required to respond to subpoenas, court orders or be asked to respond to other legitimate requests for your personal information from appropriate law enforcement or governmental authorities. We will not provide you with notice of such requests. In such situations, we will release personally identifiable information to third parties when we believe it is appropriate for us to do so in order to comply with the law or to protect against fraud.
