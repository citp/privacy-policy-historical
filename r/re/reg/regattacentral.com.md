These parties are authorized to use your Personal Information only as necessary to provide these services to us. We will use or disclose your information for a secondary purpose only if you have consented or if you would reasonably expect us to do so or if required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process. When we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. If RegattaCentral is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your Personal Information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personal Information.

**_Disclosure to overseas recipients_**

We may disclose your Personal Information to overseas recipients such as host organisations, governing bodies, clubs or event organisers which may be located in Australia, Canada, England, Germany, Belgium, Italy or the United States of America when you have sought our assistance to participate in an event or program or where disclosure is required for verification purposes. As such, the location of these overseas recipients will depend on the specific events or programs to which you apply or where such verification is required. 

The information disclosed to overseas recipients consists of any information you have given to us to provide the relevant services. By accepting services from us, you consent to us providing your Personal Information to the relevant overseas recipient as mentioned above and acknowledge that we are not responsible for ensuring their compliance with the applicable privacy laws. 

**5.** **The steps we take to protect and keep secure the Personal Information we hold**   
****   
We take reasonable steps to protect the Personal Information we hold against interference, loss, unauthorised access, use, modification or disclosure, and other misuse. 

The steps we take include: 

· maintenance of computer and network security measures such as including firewalls, use of password and other appropriate measures where information is held in electronic form; 

· regular updates to security systems to protect our systems from malicious software; 

· restriction of access to data to only those staff that need access to carry out our business activities; 

· training and ensuring that all our employees are required, as a condition of employment, to treat Personal Information held by us as confidential; 

· whenever we collect Sensitive information such as credit card data, that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way using secure socket layer technology (SSL). You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for ‘https’ at the beginning of the address of the web page. 

You should however, be aware that if you submit information to us electronically the internet is not a secure environment. We take reasonable steps to provide a secure channel for receiving information but cannot absolutely protect Personal Information before it reaches us. 

When the Personal Information that we collect is no longer required, we will destroy, delete it in a secure manner, or ensure that the information is de-identified in accordance with our information destruction and de-identification policy, unless we are required by law to retain a copy of the Personal Information. 

**6.** **How individuals can access and correct their Personal Information held by us**   
****   
You have the right to seek access to any of your Personal Information held by us unless there is a valid reason under an applicable privacy law for us to withhold the information. 

Valid reasons include where: 

· we have reason to suspect that unlawful activity or misconduct of a serious nature has been engaged in and giving access would be likely to prejudice the taking of appropriate action in relation to the matter; or 

· giving access would reveal evaluative information generated within us in connection with a commercially sensitive process; or 

· giving access would have an unreasonable impact on the privacy of other individuals; or 

· giving access would be unlawful. 

If your personal details change, or you believe the information we hold about you is incorrect, incomplete or out-of-date, please contact us so that we can correct our records or you can make the change on your Account Information page. 

Requests for access, deletion or correction to Personal Information should be addressed to the RegattaCentral Privacy Officer. All requests for access, deletion or correction to Personal Information will be responded to in writing within a reasonable period of time. As part of this process we will verify the identity of the individual requesting the information prior to providing access or making any changes. If access, deletion or correction to your Personal Information is refused we will provide reasons for our refusal.
