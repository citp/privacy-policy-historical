##  II.       General notes on data processing

### 1.        Scope of personal data processing

As a matter of principle, we collect and utilize our users' personal data only to the extent necessary for providing a functional website as well as our content and services. As a routine, users' personal data are collected and utilized only after the users have provided their consent. An exception here are cases in which obtaining consent in advance is not possible for tangible reasons, and processing of data is permitted by legal regulations. Further information in this regard is provided in the following statement.

### 2.        Legal basis for processing personal data

Article 6, Paragraph 1, Item a) of the EU's general data protection regulation (GDPR) serves as the legal basis for processing personal data, insofar as we have obtained the concerned person's consent to processing of such data.

Article 6, Paragraph 1, Item b) of the GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing personal data needed to fulfil a contract to which the concerned person is party. This also applies to processing operations needed to implement pre-contractual measures.

Article 6, Paragraph 1, Item c) of the GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing personal data needed to fulfil a legal obligation to which our company is subject. 

Article 6, Paragraph 1, Item d) of the GDPR serves as the legal basis for cases in which vital interests of the concerned person or another natural person require processing of personal data.

Article 6, Paragraph 1, Item f) of the GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing if this is needed to safeguard a legitimate interest of our company or a third party, and this interest is not outweighed by the interests or basic rights and freedoms of the person concerned. ****

### 3.        Data deletion and storage duration

An individual's personal data are deleted or blocked once the need for storage has expired. Storage beyond this scope is possible if provided for by European or national legislation as part of the EU's legal ordinances, laws or other regulations to which the responsible party is subject. Blocking or deletion of data takes place also when a storage deadline prescribed by the mentioned standards expires, unless there is a need for continued storage of data for contract conclusion or fulfilment.

## III.     Website provision and creation of log files

### 1.      Description and scope of data processing

Each time our website is invoked, our system automatically registers data and information from the invoking computer's system. ****

The following data are collected here:

(2)   The user's IP address

(3)   Date and time of access

(4)   Websites from where the user's system arrives at our Internet page

These data form part of the information saved in our system's log files. The data are not stored together with the user's remaining personal data.

### 2.        Legal basis for data processing 

Article 6, Paragraph 1, Item f) of the GDPR serves as the legal basis for temporary storage of data and log files.

### 3.        Purpose of data processing

Temporary storage of IP addresses by the system is needed to ensure website access from the user's computer. For this purpose, the user's IP address must be stored for the duration of the session. 

Log files are used for storage to ensure the website's functionality. In addition, the data allow us to optimize the website and to ensure the security of our information technology systems. Data analysis for marketing purposes does not take place in this context. 

These purposes also contain our legitimate interest in data processing according to Article 6, Paragraph 1, Item f) of the GDPR.

### 4.        Duration of storage

Data are deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary for achieving the purpose of their collection. For data collected in order to make the website accessible, this is the case when the session is finished. 

For data stored in log files, this is the case after no later than seven days. Storage beyond this scope is possible. In this case, the user's IP address is deleted or modified so that association with the invoking client is no longer possible.

### 5.        Possibility of objection and removal

Collection of data to enable website access, and storage of data in log files are absolutely necessary for website operation. The user is therefore not able to raise any objections in this regard.
