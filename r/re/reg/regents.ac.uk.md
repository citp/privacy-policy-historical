HESA may link information we have provided to other related datasets such as UCAS, NSS, Individual Learner Record and Student Loan Company data (“linked data”). All uses of your HESA information and linked data must comply with the Data Protection Act 1998.

HESA is a registered charity and operates on a not-for-profit basis. It may charge other organisations to whom it provides services and information.
