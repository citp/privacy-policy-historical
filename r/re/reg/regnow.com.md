RegNow, one of the most trusted names in e-commerce and Web-based technology, respects the privacy of our partners, clients and their customers. Any and all information collected through our system is treated with the utmost care. 

**RegNow's Privacy Guarantee**

RegNow will never sell or give our customer or client information to third parties. For customers, this means that the only people who have access to your address information is the company whose product you are ordering, and our credit card processor. 

**What information do we collect? How do we use it?**

When ordering from any of our partner sites, RegNow must collect the purchaser's name, email address, mailing address, phone number, credit card number, and expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill orders and provide notification of the order status. 

**How does RegNow protect customer information?**

Customers who buy through the RegNow system are shopping on a secure server, which encrypts all of the customer's personal information including name, address and credit card number. Encryption ensures that no one can access or use personal information in an unauthorized manner. 

Our commerce system was developed in-house with security as its number one priority. This single entry point allows RegNow to maintain the tightest access control - eliminating (rather than closing) the backdoor. 

RegNow has made an investment in protecting our clients' and customers' information utilizing the following technologies: 

> **Firewall**
> 
> Firewalls allow the use of authenticated access and can prevent certain types of traffic from entering the private network. Customizing the firewall according to the network topology is essential to having a useful firewall protection mechanism. 
> 
> **SSL (Secure Socket Layers)**
> 
> Because we accept sensitive information from end-users such as passwords and credit card numbers, RegNow's site uses SSL. This logic encrypts the data being sent to the server from the browser using high-level encryption technology. Once the data is received from customers on the RegNow Network, it may be required that the data be maintained for a certain period of time inside our private network. Encrypting the data means it cannot be viewed in plain text. 

**What about cookies?**

"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. RegNow's cookies are used only to identify the customer, not to identify any specific customer traits. These cookies do not store sensitive data. This enables a more pleasant shopping experience with RegNow every time you shop with us. 

RegNow welcomes your questions and comments about privacy.
