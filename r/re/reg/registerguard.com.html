<p>In some areas of our Web sites, we have contracted with third party technology or content providers (“Content Providers”) to provide certain information and services to users.

<p>In other areas of our Web sites, we have entered partnerships with other companies (“Partners”) who provide services on co-branded pages. On these pages, the Partner’s brand is clearly visible.  We may share data collected on co-branded areas of our site with these Partners, and the Partner’s privacy policy will apply to the Partner’s use of the data collected, which use may be different (and perhaps less restrictive) than our use as described in this privacy statement.
