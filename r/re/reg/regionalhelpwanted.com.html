<h1>Privacy Statement for RegionalHelpWanted.com</h1>
<p><i>Last Modified: 10/27/06</i></p>
<p>RegionalHelpWanted.com, Inc. has created this Privacy Statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to 
privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: RegionalHelpWanted.com.</p>
<br>

<h4>Information Collection and Use</h4>
<p>RegionalHelpWanted.com, Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected on this site.  We will not sell, 
share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this Privacy Statement, as amended from time to 
time. RegionalHelpWanted.com, Inc. collects information from our users at several different points on our website.</p>
<br>

<h4>Registration</h4>
<p>This site does not require job seekers to register. Job seekers can register to take advantage of certain free 
services, like resume posting.  Recruiters placing help wanted ads are required to register.<br><br> During registration a user is required to give their contact information (such as name and email address).  This information is used to, 
among other things, contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest.  Passwords are collected to verify the user's identity.</p>
<br>

<h4>Purchases</h4>
<p>RegionalHelpWanted.com uses order forms for customers to purchase products, and services  (such as a help wanted ads, resume access, resume writing services). We collect customers' financial information (like their account number, billing address or credit card numbers).
This information is used to bill the customer for products and services. If we have trouble processing an order, this information is used to contact the customer.</p>
<br>

<h4>Cookies</h4>
<p>A cookie is personalized data on a user's computer that we use to keep track of that user's information. For example, when the user signs in, a cookie lets us remember who the user is. We set a cookie so that users can access their account without
logging in in every time, place multiple ads, search resumes and send resumes to recruiters via the "Send My Resume" feature. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site.  The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site.  For example, the user will not be able to administer his/her account and will not be able to send his/her resume/job application to an
employer. Cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on our site.<br><br> Some of our partners use cookies on our site (for example, banner advertisers).  However, we have no access to nor control over these cookies.</p>
<br>

<h4>Log Files</h4>
<p>We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.</p>
<br>

<h4>Sharing</h4>
<p>We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners, advertisers and customers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.<br><br> We use credit card processing companies to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.<br><br>
We partner with other parties to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share and/or sell names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These third parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.<br><br> When permission is provided, we share a user's personally identifiable information with selected partners for the purpose of email 
delivery on topics that the user signed up for. We also use your personally identifiable information to cause information, offers, products, and/or services that appear to us to be consistent with your expressed interests to be directed to you. This is typically accomplished by sharing, selling, licensing, and/or transferring your personally identifiable information with third parties for direct marketing purposes.
<br><br>

From time to time we may partner with a newspaper to help drive additional candidates to your RegionalHelpWanted.com ad.  An outline of your ad may therefore appear in that newspaper as a free service. That newspaper may also call you to offer an optional print ad.

<br><br>
 When you opt in to "Please share my resume / job application with other job boards and prospective employers" we will also share your resume with researchers at <a href="http://www.mit.edu" class="noUnderLineBlack">MIT</a> who are analyzing our data for a case study of a two sided market. 
</p>
<br>

<h4>Links and Ads</h4>
<p>This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, RegionalHelpWanted.com, Inc., are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.  We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.  This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.<br><br>
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site.  These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.  If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, follow their links:
<br><a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp</a>
<br>

</p><h4>Newsletters</h4>
<p>If a user wishes to subscribe to any of our newsletters, we ask for contact information such as name and email address. Note that such information will be collected and shared in a manner consistent with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Statements, as amended from time-to-time.</p>
<br>

<h4>Surveys &amp; Contests</h4>
<p>From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests.  Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  Information requested may include contact information (such as name and email address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes.  Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. Note that such information will be collected and shared in a manner consistent with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Statements, as amended from time-to- time.</p>
<br>

<h4>Send This Ad to a Friend</h4>
<p>RegionalHelpWanted.com, Inc. never stores the email address of either the sender or the recipient of a "Send This Ad to a Friend".</p>
<br>

<h4>Security</h4>
<p>This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information.  When users submit sensitive information via the website, their information is protected both online and off-line.</p>
<table width="99%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="0">
<tbody><tr>
    <td width="2">&nbsp;</td>
	<td width="98" valign="top">



<table width="135" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">

<td width="135" align="center" valign="top">

</tr>
</tbody></table>



</td>
    <td valign="top">When our order forms ask users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry, SSL 1024-bit RSA and 56-bit DES. SSL (Secure Socket Layer) provides the strongest protection legally available. While on a secure page, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are browsing non-secure pages.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line.  All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.  Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.  Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected.</p>
<p>RegionalHelpWanted.com has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Our data center uses a wide range of physical security features, including state-of-the-art smoke detection and fire suppression systems, motion sensors, and 24x7 secured access, as well as guards, video camera surveillance and security breach alarms.</p>
<br>

<h4>Special Offers</h4>
<p>We send all new registered users a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established users will occasionally receive information on products, services and special deals from us and/or those reputable third parties with whom we may share and/or sell personally identifiable information. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our opt-out policy below.</p>
<br>

<h4>Account Information</h4>
<p>We send the user financial account notices (such as monthly statements or overdue invoices). Users are not able to un-subscribe from these notices, which contain important information about their account. We communicate issues relating to their account via email, fax, USPS and phone. In certain cases, account information may be shared with collection agents.</p>
<br>

<h4>Correction/Updating Personal Information</h4>
<p>If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us.  This can be done at the user's Account Administration page or by contacting Customer Service.</p>
<br>

<h4>Opt-Out</h4>
<p>Our users are given the opportunity to opt-out of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information.  For example, our Job Seeker registration form has an opt-out option so users who register with us, but don't want any marketing material, can keep their email address off of our lists.<br><br> Users who no longer wish to receive our informational emails or promotional materials from our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by clicking the unsubscribe or opt-out link at the bottom of the email or through their Account Administration Page.</p>
<br>

<h4>Notification of Changes</h4>
<p>If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email.  Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.</p>
