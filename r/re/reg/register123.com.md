## Privacy Policy for Certain, Inc.

Certain, Inc. is committed to respecting your online privacy and recognizes your need for appropriate protection and management of any Personally Identifiable Information you share with us. Certain has established this Privacy Policy so that you can understand how we use and protect your Personally Identifiable Information.  The array of compliance needs and standards seems to be in a state of constant change and can be daunting.  Certain provides our customers enhanced peace of mind for many different privacy and protection laws including PCI, HIPAA, DSS, PII, SOX, SAS 70, OWASP, as well as U.S., Swiss, and  E.U. Safe Harbor Frameworks.

Certain, Inc. has been awarded TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy policy and practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with [TRUSTe's program requirements](http://www.truste.com/privacy_seals_and_services/consumer_privacy/privacy-programs-requirements.html) including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal information.

If you have questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact us at [privacy@certain.com](mailto:privacy@certain.com). If you are not satisfied with our response you can contact [TRUSTe here](http://watchdog.truste.com/pvr.php?page=complaint). The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this Web site, and does not cover information that may be collected through software downloaded from the site.

This Privacy Statement relates to the website: [www.certain.com](http://register123.com/undefined/) and services provided through Certain Website or Certain-Powered Websites. A “Certain-Powered Website” shall mean a domain not owned by Certain, but which has a license from Certain to utilize specific Certain technologies. A “User” means any individual who has access to or uses a Certain Website or Certain-Powered Website, including buyers of Certain software services, attendees of meetings organized through a Certain Website or Certain-Powered Website, visitors to Public Websites, and other employees and agents of corporate clients and Suppliers.

We cover only our data processing practices described in this Privacy Statement. Without limitation, this Privacy Statement does not cover data that we collect offline, on businesses or legal entities or on our employees.

**Notice and Disclosure**

Personally Identifiable Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual User, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a home or other physical address, an e-mail address or other contact information. In general, you can visit Certains’ web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any Personally Identifiable Information about yourself.

Third parties provide certain services on Certains’ behalf. For example, Certain contracts with third parties to process payment information. Certain may provide information, including Personally Identifiable Information that Certain collects, to such third party service providers to help us deliver programs, products, information and services. These third party service providers are obligated to protect your Personally Identifiable Information on Certains’ behalf, and to comply with this Privacy Policy.

If you decide to use Certain software services, we will collect registration information for events. After completing registration, your information is transferred to the event organizer and becomes the responsibility of the meeting planner and event organizer. The registration data that we collect is the property of the contracted organization at all times. Certain is not responsible for the privacy practices of meeting planners and event organizers who are our clients. End users submitting personal information to client users of Certain software are subject to the sharing, updating, and use restrictions and rights of the individual client.

**Suppliers of Services to Corporate Clients**

Certain provides access to its applications via Certain Websites and/or Certain-Powered Websites to suppliers of services to corporate clients. Such entities would include hotels, convention and visitors bureaus, and destination management companies.

**Buyers of Services for Corporate Clients**

Individuals and companies (“Buyers”) use Certains’ technology via the Certain Website or Certain-Powered Websites on behalf of corporate clients to manage meetings, and to purchase services for these meetings and events from Suppliers.

**Attendees of Meetings Planned by Corporate Clients**

Attendees use Certain software services when invited by a corporate client to attend a meeting. They do so by viewing a Certain-Powered Website that contains questions created by the corporate client. By responding to these questions, the attendee gives the corporate client information about the attendee’s plans for attending that specific meeting.

If you choose to provide us with your Personally Identifiable Information, we may transfer that Personally Identifiable Information within Certain, across borders and from your country to other countries around the world. If you are subject to the European Union Data Protection Directive, laws implementing the Directive, or similar laws, you hereby freely consent to the transfer of your Personally Identifiable Information outside of the European Union to the United States and other countries and to the use of your Personally Identifiable Information by Certain as described in this Privacy Policy.

Certain, Inc. complies with the U.S. – E.U. and U.S. – Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal data from European Union member countries and Switzerland.

We do not sell your personal information to third parties. We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement. We may also share your information under the following circumstances:

  * As required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process

  * If Certain, Inc. is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information

**Choice**

You may choose whether or not to provide Personally Identifiable Information to Certain. If you choose not to provide the Personally Identifiable Information we request, you can still visit most of Certain's web sites, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers and services (such as Certain software) that involve our interaction with you.

When we collect your Personally Identifiable Information, we will provide a means for you to opt-out of Certain sharing your Personally Identifiable Information with our business partners. For example, should you elect to receive our Newsletter and/or promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving further communications by following those instructions in the email and/or via the unsubscribe link contained in the email. Even if you opt-out of such uses, you understand and consent to Certains’ sharing of your Personally Identifiable Information with third party payment processors, solely for the purposes of processing your payment for the Certain services.

For attendees, if you decide to use Certain software services we will only send e-mail messages directly relating to registrations, including:

  * Confirmation of completed registration
  * Notice of incomplete registration
  * Additional information about the event or your registration



We do not allow users to elect not to receive these messages, because they are vital to completing the registration process.

The event organizer has the option of using your Personally Identifiable Information, which we provide to them, in order to send you information. Certain is not responsible for the privacy practices of event organizers who are its clients.

**Links to Other Web Sites**

We may post our clients’ comments, testimonials & reviews on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information. We do obtain the customer's consent via email prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their comments.

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
