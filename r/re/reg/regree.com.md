# Privacy Policy

**Regree respects your privacy**

We will not sell, trade or rent personally identifiable information about our users to other parties, without our users' consent.

We do, however, share certain aggregate information about our users to our suppliers, i.e. Most of site visitors is from north america. This enables us to constantly build a large database of products and suppliers, giving you wider shopping options.

We also reserve the right to disclose user information in special cases. For example, when we have reason to believe that such disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be infringing (or threatening to infringe) or who may otherwise be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally), our title, rights, interests or property, or those of other web site users, or of anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. We also reserve the right to disclose, without notice to you, personal information in response to a subpoena or other judicial order or when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is required by any law, regulation or listing requirement, or by any stock/securities exchange, governmental or regulatory authority.

 **Collection of information**

When you visit our website, we do not collect personally identifiable information about you, except when you specifically and knowingly provide it.

If you decide to register for the newsletter, or if you request information from us, you will be asked to provide certain information and details, including your name, country and e-mail address.

 **Use of information**

We may use the information you provide to respond to your requests for additional information, to contact you, if necessary, to service your account or for other administrative purposes. We may also access your information to resolve disputes, to troubleshoot problems, to enforce agreements between us, or for marketing purposes. In addition, for certain transactions, our system may use your transaction details to automate and to streamline your transaction by checking for electronic data compliance, providing reporting features, and transferring data from previous forms to those of the current transaction.

We may also use the information you provide for certain mailing initiatives. For example, you may sometimes receive an invitation to answer surveys or try out new products and services from global sources. Your feedback helps us develop new products and services based on your needs.
