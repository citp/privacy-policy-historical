####  **COOKIES AND TRACKING**

We utilize cookies and tracking pixels to increase our productivity and overall client experience. A cookie is a small data string that is written on your computer hard drive by a web server. (A web server is the computer that hosts a website and responds to requests received from your computer). Cookies can play an important role in providing a great customer experience using the web. Among other things, cookies enable a website to maintain information when a user’s web browser requests a series of web pages. Without cookies, for example, a website owner may not be able to recognize that a user just completed the first step during an ordering process so that the second step can be presented.

Cookies generally hold information, including data strings that contain a unique user ID which allow our website and our affiliates, agents and partners, to customize your experiences and gather information relevant to what you may be interested in. For example, cookies allow us, and others who place and access cookies on our website, to deliver advertising and other content specific to your interests, keep track of your purchases and alert you to new products or promotional opportunities based on your current services.

For example, most browsers will allow you to choose what cookies can be placed on your computer and to delete or disable cookies.

We also collect identifiable information through the use of tracking pixels. A tracking pixel is a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a web page and, in combination with a cookie, allows for the collection of information regarding the use of the web page that contains the tracking pixel. We use tracking pixels to tell when an advertisement has been clicked on or otherwise interacted with, track the web traffic of affiliates, agents and partners of Regal Assets and use that information to judge which advertisements are more appealing to users and which affiliate, agents and parters are successful with their marketing efforts. With tracking pixels and cookies our affiliates, agents and partners who have referred business to Regal Assets are able to access limited private information such as first name, IP address, potential investment amount and the state or region of the referral who accessed our website. Affiliates, agents and partners have access to this limited private information so that they can fine tune and tailor their individual marketing campaigns toward specific demographics. In all cases, we use third-party service providers to help us collect and analyze this information.

Our website contains web beacons in the form of clear .gif files, which are electronic images that allow for the collection of information about your interactions on our sites.
