                          to applicable laws and established company security 
                          standards and practices. We have security measures in

                          of information under our control, and we continually 
                          evaluate new technologies for safeguarding your information.

                          security of electronic transmissions via the Internet 
                          because they may potentially use unsecure computers

                          means of communication, please contact us.</p>

                          with varying levels of security. Some networks may have 
                          taken steps to secure e-mail transmissions while others 
                          have not, thereby compromising the privacy and integrity 
                          of an e-mail. An e-mail may be copied, altered or destroyed. 
                          Regence will respect your request not to be contacted

                          you might have. We also do this in an effort to meet 
                          legal and regulatory requirements.</p>
