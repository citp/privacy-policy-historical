ParetoLogic Inc. is committed to protecting the privacy of personal information you  may provide to us when using any of our online services. This Privacy Policy  describes how we treat information we receive when you transmit data to ParetoLogic. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Information Collection</strong><br>
        When you purchase,  download trial or evaluation versions, or register RegCure software, we may  collect personal information including your name, address, email address, etc.  for the purpose of recording the transaction when you engage in activities on  our web site or within the RegCure software. When we use a payment  processing merchant we ensure that the same strict privacy criteria are in  place. We do not (knowingly) collect personal information from persons under  the age of eighteen. We also give users the option of receiving useful product  information (such as updates, pest alerts and associated product offerings),  via opt-in permission based email. We fully ensure your privacy and value your  trust. We will never sell, rent, lease, or give your information to a third  party unless required to do &nbsp;so by law.  You may opt out of receiving emails from us at any time by clicking the  unsubscribe link in the email or by visiting our website at <a href="/" target="_top" id="bluelink">www.regcure.com</a>. By choosing to enter  and submit the requested information when prompted, you are consenting to ParetoLogic’s  collection, use, and disclosure of such information for the purposes as  outlined herein.<p></p>
        <p>Any information  that you post to a chat room, public bulletin or forum is available to all  users of that site. ParetoLogic cannot control, nor is it responsible for the  use, disclosure, or dissemination of such information by any third parties.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Web Site Usage</strong> <br>
          We may  automatically collect IP addresses and Web site usage information when you  access our online services. This information helps us evaluate how our visitors  navigate our sites on an aggregate basis, including but not limited to the  number and frequency of visitors, length of visits, etc. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>How Information Is Used When Collected</strong> <br>
          We may use  information collected in the following ways:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>To process, validate and verify  purchases.</li>
          <li>To contact you to reconfirm or verify  accuracy of information provided.</li>
          <li>To register you as a customer.</li>
          <li>To open and maintain a support account  for you.</li>
          <li>To send email notifications about new,  existing, enhanced products or services. </li>
          <li>To send information on special offers,  or to obtain your feedback to help enhance existing features or provide added  products and services. </li>
          <li>To enable us to personalize content,  advertising and promotions based on preferences, needs, suggestions, or  recommendations.</li>
          <li>To provide advance notice of  termination of a trial period or an opportunity to extend a trial period, or  advance notice of expiration of your software license.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>          We may disclose and use personally identifiable information in special  circumstances where it is necessary to enforce our service agreements or terms  of use (for example protect our intellectual property rights), and your  compliance with the applicable End User License Agreement(s) contained within  the RegCure software. We may also disclose or use your personal information  when we, in good faith, believe that the applicable law may require us to do  so. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Cookies</strong> <br>
        We define a cookie as any string of data and information that is automatically  stored on your computer upon access to our services. ParetoLogic employs  cookies to assign temporary identification numbers to machines that access our  services. This information enables us to deliver faster service capabilities to  our customers or to our affiliates and/or other sales partners, prevent denial  of service attacks on our systems, detect and prevent fraudulent transactions,  and assist with awarding proper sales credit to our partners. All RegCure.com or ParetoLogic  cookies are 1) of limited duration, 2) less than 5KB in length, 3) only visible  to RegCure.com or ParetoLogic, and 4) devoid of any personally identifiable information. Our  Cookies are mainly maintained to track our affiliates and/or other sales  partners to ensure proper payments for their sales and tracking activities  relating to their affiliate relationship with us. </p>
        <p><strong>Links</strong><br>
        We may offer links from our website to other third party websites which may be  hosted by our co-branding partners or by unrelated companies which we think may  be of interest to you. Such websites are not governed by this privacy policy  and ParetoLogic makes no representation as to their practices for dealing with  your personal information. We recommend that you check the privacy policy of  any website at the beginning of your visit.</p>
        <p><strong>Security</strong><br>
          The personally identifiable information we collect about you is stored in  limited access servers. We maintain such safeguards to protect security of  servers and your personally identifiable information. We retain personally  identifiable information only as long as necessary to complete a purchase, provide  customer service, or maintain your account with us. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Policy Modifications</strong><br>
          We may change this  Privacy Policy at any time without notice to you in order to reflect our  practices and provide greater protection for your information. Any changes to  this Privacy Policy will be posted promptly here, so please check back  periodically. </p>
        <p><strong>Acceptance of Terms</strong><br>
          By using the ParetoLogic  services, accessing the RegCure.com web site, or purchasing ParetoLogic  products you are consenting to the practices relating to information collection  and use that are described in this Privacy Policy.<br>
