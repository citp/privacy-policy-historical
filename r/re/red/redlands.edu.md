# University of Redlands - Privacy Policy

## Privacy Policy

The University of Redlands is committed to ensuring the privacy and accuracy of your confidential information and to compliance with both state and federal regulations concerning the use of personal information. Other than as required by laws that guarantee thrid party to certain types of information, or in response to subpoenas or other legal instruments that authorize access, personally-identifiable information is not shared. In particular, we do not re-distribute or sell personal information collected on our Web servers. This policy applies to information that is collected by any means whether electronically, by telephone or on paper.

**Information Collected**  
University of Redlands' Web sites may collect personal information such as name, address, e-mail address, telephone number(s), Student ID and/or educational interests. Such personal information may be requested for research, public service or teaching programs or for administrative purposes. Additional personal information, such as credit card account information, may be requested for purchases or enrollment purposes.

Web servers typically collect the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer being used; Web pages requested; referring Web page; browser used; date and time. University of Redlands may collect statistics identifying particular IP addresses from which our Web sites are accessed.

**Use of Collected Information  
** University of Redlands may use personal information collected from Web sites for the purpose of future communication back to online enrollees, in order to keep you informed of such activities as campus programs, symposia and/or special events, but only if you are provided the opportunity to opt out of that type of use.

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site by identifying (1) which parts of our site are most heavily used, and (2) which portion of our audience comes from within the University's network. We do not link IP addresses to personally identifiable information. This means that user sessions will be tracked, but the users remain anonymous.

Some University of Redlands sites use "cookies" in order to deliver Web content specific to individual users' interests. Sensitive personal information is not stored within cookies.

** University of Redlands will not disclose, without your consent, personal information collected about you, except for certain explicit circumstances in which disclosure is required by law. Additionally, the University of Redlands will not distribute or sell personal information to third-party organizations.
