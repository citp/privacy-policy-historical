**Scope of Privacy Policy** This Privacy Policy applies to any personal information that we receive from you e.g. through subscription and sales on this website, and subsequently process e.g. through (RED) email alerts. It sets out the basis on which any personal information we receive will be collected, shared, and used by us. When we say personal information, we mean any data that can be used to identify you as a particular individual, such as your name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number, and credit card or debit card number. Also, our Privacy Policy applies not only to information you personally provide to us, but also to information we collect through technology, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, cookies, browser type, date/time stamp, location, pages visited and stored passwords, if any. A cookie is a small data file that our server sends to your browser when you visit the site. The use of cookies helps us to assist your use of certain aspects of the site. We may use information from cookies for the following purposes: Traffic monitoring:the IP address from which you access the site, the type of browser and operating system used to access the site, the date and time of your access to the site, the pages you visit the Internet address of the website from which you accessed the site, to recognize repeat visitors for statistical / analytical purposes. You can remove or block cookies using the settings in your browser, but that may impact your ability to use this website. Our site may contain links for your benefit to third party web sites operated by our partners, by manufacturers, and other third parties. If you click on such a link you will no longer be on our website. You must read the privacy policy of the third party to see how your personal information will be handled on that site. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices, content, or security of any third party site.

Access to certain portions of this website is restricted to people of legal drinking age, including access to all advertising and marketing information on this website relating to alcohol. Date of birth affirmation is required at the entrance to those portions of the website and age affirmation prompts may also be located elsewhere on the website. If someone under the legal drinking age has provided us with personal information by obtaining access in violation of the website access restrictions, (RED) asks that the parent or guardian of that person contact us at the e-mail address at the bottom of this Privacy Policy and request removal of the information from our records. Upon receiving your request, we will promptly remove such information from our records.

#### DISCLOSURE AND SHARING OF INFORMATION

We reserve the right to implement programs with partners and other websites in order to improve the service we offer. As part of these programs, these third parties may share information with us. For example, when you click on information in relation to one of our partners, we may ask partners to tell us how you responded to the information we showed.  
We may provide information to service providers that help us serve you better. This may include, but is not limited to, the use of third parties to help host our website, send out email updates, remove repetitive information from our user lists, process payments and fulfill orders for merchandise, fraud prevention, or provide search results or links (including sponsored links). These service providers may have access to your personal information for use for a limited time, but we will implement appropriate contractual and technical protections to limit their use of that information to helping us provide the service.

Also, we must reserve the right to use or disclose any information as needed to satisfy any law.
