      	<h1>Legal information – privacy and cancellations</h1>			
				<br>
				<h2>Our privacy policy</h2>
				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>Red Gate (which means here Red Gate Software Limited and its subsidiaries Red Gate Software Inc. and Red Gate Software Pte) respects your privacy. All information you give us is held with the utmost care and security.</p>
				<p>This privacy policy sets out our privacy practices. Please take time to review this privacy policy as it tells you how your personal information will be treated by us. We do not sell, rent or loan any identifiable information regarding our customers to any third party. Only in the circumstances described within this Privacy Policy would we share your information with any third party.</p>
				<p>Our use of personal data in the UK is in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 and our Subsidiaries’ practices in Singapore and the US are as far as reasonably possible in line with those in the UK. In Singapore our activities are governed by the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 and in the USA we comply with the principles of the US Safe Harbor program. Any questions regarding Red Gate’s privacy policy should be directed to the Data Controller at <a href="mailto:privacy@red-gate.com">privacy@red-gate.com</a>, or alternatively see the section <a href="/our-company/about/legal#contact">Contacting us</a>.</p>
				<h4>Use of information</h4>
				<p>Red Gate will not collect any personal information about individuals except as set out in this privacy policy.</p>
				<p>Examples of the types of personal information we will collect are: name, company, postal address, email address, phone number, details of website and product usage and product commentary.</p>
				<p>We will use the personal information provided to us in order to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>process orders submitted by you;</li>
					<li>customize the service we provide to you;</li>
					<li>administrate or otherwise carry out our obligations in relation to any agreement you have with us;</li>
					<li>verify your identity (for example if you participate in any promotions administered by us);</li>
					<li>anticipate and resolve any problems with any goods or services supplied to you;</li>
					<li>carry out market research and surveys and track sales data;</li>
					<li>send you our newsletter, where this is requested by you;</li>
					<li>track your engagement with us, including through our website, articles and newsletters;</li>
					<li>to send you follow-up communications relating to software downloaded from our site; and</li>
					<li>send you information about our other products and services.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>We may collect any personal information provided by you to us through this website or via one of our telephone operators, or we may collect this information through your email or other communications with us. Certain information is collected automatically, as described later in the privacy policy.</p>
				<p>We may also ask you for other optional information such as what sort of equipment/device/software you use and what other subjects interest you. If you choose to give us this information, we will use it to help us to provide you with the best possible service that is personalized to your needs and preferences.</p>
				<p>Although we do not make it compulsory to give us every item of information we ask for, the more information volunteered by our customers (and the more accurate it is), the better we can match our services to the needs of the body of our customers.</p>
				<p>We also collect information from you if you choose to take part in any of our on-site surveys or promotions. We will use this information to administer the promotion, help us to plan other promotions and improve the services we provide.</p>
				<h4>Third-Parties and their sites</h4>
				<p>Certain Red Gate services, such as payment processing or assisting with user evaluation of our products, are offered in conjunction with our (third-party) business partners. In such cases, we may need to share your personal information with them in order to provide these services. In this instance, please note that certain services may be unavailable if you do not want to disclose the personal information you are asked for.</p>
				<p>Where our services make use of hosted tools, hosted data storage and payment services provided by third parties any of your personal information stored by such third parties shall be subject to their privacy provisions.</p>
				<p>Whilst we choose our business partners carefully, unfortunately we cannot be responsible for their privacy policies and practices or those of other sites that you access using links from our site. Therefore we recommend that you check the policy of each site you visit.</p>
				<p>In addition, if you linked to our site from a third party site, we cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of the owners or operators of that third party site and recommend that you check the policy of that third party site and contact its owner or operator if you have any concerns or questions.</p>
				<h4>Call Recording</h4>
				<p>We only record calls that we believe will help us improve the products and services we provide, or help us evaluate our performance in customer-orientated parts of the business. Furthermore we do not record calls in any jurisdiction where dual consent is required.</p>
				<p>In addition, we will only record a call we conduct with you (incoming or outgoing) having already announced to you our intent to do so and given you the opportunity not to participate.</p>
				<h4>Log files/IP addresses</h4>
				<p>When you visit our site, we automatically log your IP address which is recognized by our web server. We use IP addresses to help us administer the site, to collect broad demographic information for aggregate use and to track your engagement with us.</p>
				<h4>Non personal information</h4>
				<p>We may automatically collect non-personal information about you, such as the type of internet browsers you use and the site from which you linked to our site. You cannot be identified from this information and it is only used to assist us in providing an effective service on our site.</p>
				<p>Red Gate may share non-personal aggregate or summary information regarding its customers with partners or other third parties, such as information relating to the number of users linking to our site from their sites but Red Gate does not sell or share any information at the individual level.</p>
				<h4>Cookies</h4>

This cookie will be activated on download of a Red Gate product, but can retrospectively identify your past visits to any Red Gate website.</p>
				<p>Red Gate also uses in-product cookies to collect, maintain, process and use analytics data related to your use of Red Gate products.  These are enabled by default, but may be disabled by you at any time.</p>

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we would disclose it.</p>
