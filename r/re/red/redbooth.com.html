		<b>Privacy Policy</b>
<br><br>
Welcome to rent<b>anything</b>.com. We are committed to protecting the privacy of our renters and rental suppliers and developed this policy to demonstrate our commitment to this issue. This policy discloses our practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of the information we receive through the rent<b>anything</b>.com Web site (the "Site"). By using the Site, you consent to the data collection and use practices described below. If we decide to change our policy, we will publish a notice on the Site that the policy has been changed and post those changes on this page. Continued use by you of the Site constitutes your agreement to be bound by and subjected to this Privacy Policy.
<br><br>
<b>General Practice </b>
<br><br>
In conjunction with consummating rental transactions, rent<b>anything</b>.com will share your personal identification information only with rent<b>anything</b>.com registered users as described below. Personal identification information will also be used for internal purposes and access to this information will be limited to authorized employees of rent<b>anything</b>.com. We do not share any billing account information collected on the Site with any third party other than our credit card processor, which may be provided the information necessary to complete a credit card transaction or an authorization for a damage deposit. 
<br><br>
<b>Information We Collect </b>
<br><br>
Rent<b>anything</b>.com requires that renters and rental suppliers register before they may use the Site. During the course of this registration process, rent<b>anything</b>.com collects personal identification information and other user data. 
<br><br>
Renters provide personal identification information such as legal name, address, telephone number, fax number, e-mail address, and a user created ID and password. In addition, rent<b>anything</b>.com may collect billing account information, which includes billing related contact information as well as payment, credit card and/or tax identification number information. 
<br><br>
Rental suppliers provide personal identification information such as legal name, company name, address, telephone number, fax number, e-mail address and a user created ID and password. In addition, rent<b>anything</b>.com may collect billing account information, which includes billing related contact information as well as payment, credit card and/or tax identification number information. 
<br><br>
Renters and rental suppliers both post information on the Site relating to rental transactions. rent<b>anything</b>.com may collect this information and associate it with personal identification information to construct personalized user pages detailing a user's transaction activity. 
<br><br>
rent<b>anything</b>.com may also run promotions on the Site during which additional user information is collected. Any information collected during such promotions will be subject to terms of the promotion and will not be subject to this privacy policy. 
<br><br>
Finally, rent<b>anything</b>.com may collect aggregate level user information to share with third parties. The aggregate level user information shared will not contain any personal identification information and cannot be tied to any individual user. 
<br><br>
<b>How We Use the Information We Collect </b>
<br><br>
Except as outlined below, rent<b>anything</b>.com only uses your personal identification information to consummate rental transactions and for other internal purposes. More specifically, after a renter and a rental supplier mutually agree upon a rental transaction, rent<b>anything</b>.com will disclose the parties personal identification information (i.e., name, address, e-mail address, and phone number) for the purpose of allowing the parties to contact each other directly to finalize any arrangements regarding the rental transaction. Obviously, when consummating the rental transaction the renter and rental supplier may share additional personal identification and other information. The sharing of this information, however, is between the parties to the rental transaction, is not subject to this privacy policy, and rent<b>anything</b>.com has no involvement or bears no responsibility for any information provided in that process. 
<br><br>
Except as outlined below, all personal identification information beyond name, address, email address, and phone number will be used solely for rent<b>anything</b>.com internal purposes. These internal purposes include contacting renters regarding rental responses received, contacting rental suppliers regarding their listings and notifying both renters and rental suppliers of other relevant operational activity related to the Site. This information may also be used to notify renters and rental suppliers of rent<b>anything</b>.com promotions. 
<br><br>
Except as outlined below, rent<b>anything</b>.com will never share billing account information with any third party other than our credit card transaction processor, which may be provided with the information necessary to complete a credit card transaction or an authorization for a damage deposit. This information will also be used internally for billing purposes. 
<br><br>
Except as outlined below, rent<b>anything</b>.com will use rental transaction information associated with personal identification information to construct personalized user pages detailing a user's transaction activity. 
<br><br>
Except as outlined below, rent<b>anything</b>.com may share aggregate level user information with third parties. For example rent<b>anything</b>.com may want to collect information relating to the percentage of renters looking to rent automobiles to share with prospective or actual rental suppliers. This aggregate information will not contain any personal identification information and cannot be tied to any individual user. 
<br><br>
Rent<b>anything</b>.com considers all information collected on the Site to be a business asset.  In the event that rent<b>anything</b>.com or substantially all of its assets are acquired, such information will be one of the transferred business assets.  rent<b>anything</b>.com may also release personal identification information, billing account information, or any other user information when appropriate to comply with the law; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of rent<b>anything</b>.com, its registered users, or other third parties.
