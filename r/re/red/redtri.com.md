### Editorial policy

Just so you know, our newsletters and blog posts are about stores,  
products, people, events, restaurants, classes, activities, etc.,  
that the editors think are neat-o. This content is not paid for.

All of our content is local to the five markets we cover – Seattle,  
San Francisco, Portland, Los Angles and San Diego – so if you have  
a product or story idea, please make sure it is relevant to those  
markets (i.e. local distribution).

We’re not really into product reviews, so don’t worry about sending us anything besides a press release/product description. We’ll do the rest of the work ourselves (we’re sure you can find tons of sites that want to review your product). Please send your info directly to the most relevant editor. See our team bios [here. ](http://www.redtri.com/team)

When you see advertising in the newsletter or on the site, it will  
be clearly labeled “sponsor,” “sponsored content”  
or “dedicated email.” Advertisers do not have any extra  
say in what we cover editorially. Though we love our advertisers,  
we want our readers to trust that we’re sending them unbiased  
tidbits of news.

Favorites* is a highly-selective  advertising program that offers ongoing promotion  
of local businesses that we love and use ourselves. The sponsored  
content is labeled as such and kept separate from our regular  
posts.
