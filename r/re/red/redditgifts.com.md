# redditgifts Privacy Policy

_Effective Date: September 2, 2016_

We want you to understand how and why Reddit, Inc. ("Reddit," "we" or "us") collects, uses, and shares information about you when you access and use the Reddit Gifts website and other online products and services related to Reddit Gifts (collectively, the "Reddit Gifts Services" or "Reddit Gifts").

The collection and use of your information in connection with the Reddit Gifts Services is subject to the [Reddit, Inc. Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy/) (the "Privacy Policy"), and this Reddit Gifts Privacy Notice (the "Notice") explains some important additional things we would like you to understand about the information we collect when you access the Reddit Gifts Services and how that information is used.

In addition to reviewing this Notice, please review the [Reddit Gifts Terms of Service](https://www.redditgifts.com/terms/). Your use of the Reddit Gifts Services constitutes agreement to its terms and conditions as well. As Reddit Gifts's Terms of Service prohibits users from being under 13 years of age, this Notice does not discuss use of Reddit Gifts by minors under the age of 13.

## Additional Information You Provide to Us

We collect additional information about you when you use the Reddit Gifts Services. You may be asked to provide us with personal information such as your name, address, telephone number, age, personal interests, and email address. You may also be required to provide log-in information for an existing Reddit Account or to create one before using Reddit Gifts. Any information we collect from your use of the Reddit Gifts Services may be associated with the Reddit Account being used for the Reddit Gifts Services.

When using the Reddit Gifts Services, you may also choose to provide additional information to us. This may include posts, photographs, comments, messages, financial or payment information, shipping information, or other information related to your use of the Reddit Gifts Services.

We may share your information with other companies or individuals outside of Reddit as permitted under the Privacy Policy and as authorized by you or by your use of the Reddit Gifts Services.

For example, when participating in a gift exchange or other transaction with another user, the other user may request and we may provide such other user with the information about you necessary to complete the exchange or transaction, such as your name, Reddit Account, email address, contact details, address, or other information about you needed to promote the success and security of the exchange or transaction. The user receiving your information is not allowed to use this information for purposes unrelated to completing the exchange or transaction. Contacting users in an unwanted manner, including for marketing purposes, is a violation of the Reddit Gifts Terms of Service and may be reported to [support@redditgifts.com](mailto:support@redditgifts.com). If an exchange or transaction fails or is otherwise unsuccessful, we may provide an alternate user with the information about you necessary to complete a substitute exchange or transaction.

We may also share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners. For example, we may share information to show trends about the general use of, the participation in, or the geographic reach of the Reddit Gifts Services.

Any information you decide to share with a public audience, including information in your public profile or information you submit to a public page, is available to anyone on or off of Reddit and the Reddit Gifts Services. Of course, publicly available information can be seen or accessed through search engines and most other media.

We will ask for your consent before sharing your information in a manner other than those that are set out in this Notice or in the Privacy Policy.

## Additional Choices

As a user of the Reddit Gifts Services, you have additional choices about how to protect and limit the collection, use, and disclosure of certain information about you. You may delete your account associated with the Reddit Gifts Services at any time by contacting [support@redditgifts.com](mailto:support@redditgifts.com). When you delete your account, your Reddit Gifts profile is no longer visible to other users and is disassociated from content you posted under that account. However, the posts, photographs, comments, and messages you submitted to the Reddit Gifts Services before deleting your account will still be visible to other users unless you delete such content before deleting your account. Reddit may also retain certain information about you as required by law or for legitimate business purposes after you delete your account. If you would like to delete your Reddit Account in addition to your Reddit Gifts account, please follow the process outlined in the Privacy Policy.

## Changes

We may update this Notice from time to time. If we do, we will let you know by revising the date at the top of the Notice. If we make a change to this Notice that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will provide you with additional notice (such as by adding a statement to redditgifts.com or by otherwise sending you a notification). We encourage you to review this Notice whenever you access or use the Reddit Gifts Services or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.

If you have any questions about this Reddit Gifts Privacy Notice, please email [legal@reddit.com](mailto:legal@reddit.com).
