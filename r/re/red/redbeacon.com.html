Red Beacon, Inc. ("Redbeacon", "we" or "us") provides this Privacy
Policy to inform users of our policies and procedures regarding the
collection, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information
received from users of this website, located at <a href="http://www.redbeacon.com">www.redbeacon.com</a> ("Website") or
collected via email, SMS, telephone, WAP or other means. This Privacy
Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason; each version
will apply to information collected while it was in place. We will
notify you of any material changes to our Privacy Policy by posting
the new Privacy Policy on our Website. You are advised to consult this
Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.  By using or accessing the
Website, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy
Policy.
</p><p>
By using our Website you are consenting to our processing of your
information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by
us. "Processing" means using cookies on a computer or using or
touching information in any way, including, but not limited to,
collecting, storing, deleting, using, combining and disclosing
information, all of which activities will take place in the United
States. If you reside outside the U.S., your personally identifiable
information will be transferred to the U.S., and processed and stored
there under U.S. privacy standards. By visiting our Website and
providing information to us, you consent to such transfer to, and
processing in, the U.S.
</p><p></p><p>
If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy or our
use of your personally identifiable information, please contact us
at support [at] redbeacon.com.
</p><h2>Information Collection and Use</h2><p><strong>Information Collected Upon Visiting.</strong>  When you visit
the Website, our servers automatically record information that your
browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data"). This Log Data
may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the
domain from which you are visiting, the web-pages you visit, the
search terms you use, and any advertisements or links on which you
click. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service
provider the IP address will be different every time you log on. We
use Log Data to monitor the use of the Website and of our Service, and
for the Website's technical administration. 
</p><p><strong>Information Collected Upon Registration.</strong> If you
desire to have access to certain restricted sections of the Website,
you will be required to become a registered user, and to submit
certain personally identifiable information to Redbeacon. This happens
in a number of instances, such as when you sign up for the Redbeacon
service, if you desire to receive marketing materials and information,
if you submit a Service Request, and/or if you create a Skill Profile
to offer services through Redbeacon. Personally identifiable
information that we may collect in such instances may include your
full name, password, email address, street address, time zone,
telephone number, mobile phone number for text messages, photographs you
upload, and other information that you decide to provide us with, or
that you decide to include in your public profile.  If you register as
a Service Provider, create a Skill Profile, and/or Quote on a Service
Request, we may request and store your credit card number and other
personally identifiable information.
</p><p><strong>Business Information.</strong> If you create a Skill Profile, you have the
opportunity to provide additional information ("Business Information")
such as your business
name, logo or avatar, credentials and qualifications, year of business
establishment, as well as links to your personal web site, if you have
one. You may also upload a photograph portfolio of your previous
work. We may supplement or modify the Business Information to conform
to our editorial policies or to add information from your website,
materials that you supply to us, or publicly available sources. When you respond to a Consumer's Service Request, all of
the Business Information is displayed to the Consumer making such
Service Request. Providing additional information beyond what is
required at registration is entirely optional, but may enable you
market your services more effectively and potentially win more jobs on
the Website.  
</p><p>
If you provide an optional mobile phone number, you will receive
notifications on your mobile phone in a number of cases, such as
when Redbeacon updates you on a new job offer or service request, or a
status change of an existing job or service request.  You may sign up
for notifications and modify your notification preferences to better
control when Redbeacon sends you email or SMS notifications.    
</p><p>
If you contact us by email through the Website, we may keep a record
of your contact information and correspondence, and use such
information to respond to your inquiry.
</p><p><strong>Survey.</strong> We may also collect information if you
participate in surveys conducted by or on behalf of us or our partner
companies, including but not limited to questionnaires, telephone
interiew and/or discussion groups, and otherwise providing general
information about the Redbeacon service.</p><p><strong>Anonymous Data.</strong> We may create Anonymous Data records
from information collected from you (such as information contained in a Service
Request) by excluding information (such as your name) that make the
data personally identifiable to you. "Anonymous Data" means data that is not
associated with or linked to your personal information; Anonymous Data
does not permit the identification of individual persons.  We reserve
the right to use and disclose Anonymous Data to third parties in our discretion.Datayou.  
</p><h3>Use of Contact Information.</h3><p>In general, we may use information that we collect about you
to:</p><ul class="list"><li>deliver the products and services that you have requested;</li><li>manage your account and provide you with customer support;</li><li>perform research and analysis about your use of, or interest in, our products, services, or content, or products, services or content offered by others;</li><li>communicate with you by e-mail, postal mail, telephone and/or mobile devices or send newsletters about products or services that may be of interest to you;</li><li>communicate with you with regard to partially completed service requests or job offers;</li><li>develop and display content and advertising tailored to your interests on our site and other sites;</li><li>create Anonymous Data records from such information;</li><li>verify your eligibility and deliver prizes in connection with contests and sweepstakes;</li><li>enforce our terms and conditions;</li><li>manage our business; and</li><li>perform functions as otherwise described to you at the time of collection.</li></ul><p>
In addition, we may use your contact information to market to you, and
provide you with information about, our products and services,
including but not limited to our service. If you decide at any time
that you no longer wish to receive such information or communications
from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of
the communications.
</p><h2>Cookies</h2><p>
Like many websites, we also use "cookie" technology to collect
additional website usage data and to improve the Website and our
service. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your
computer's hard disk. We do not use cookies to collect
personally identifiable information. When you visit Redbeacon, we send
one or more cookies - small file containing a string of
characters - to your computer or other device that uniquely
identifies your browser. Redbeacon may use cookies to better
understand how you interact with the Website and our Service, to
monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the
Website, and to improve the Website and our services.  Most Internet
browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser,
by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you
before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.
</p><h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2><p>
We want you to understand when and with whom we may share personal or
other information we have collected about you or your activities on
our web site or while using our services.  We do not share your
personal information with others except as indicated below or when we
inform you and give you an opportunity to opt out of having your
personal information shared.  Under no circumstances, other than in
the event of a Business Transfer (as discussed below) will Redbeacon
sell, rent or lease its Consumer lists (or the Consumer list of any
individual Service Provider) to a third party.
</p><p>Circumstance under which we may share your personal
information:</p><p><strong>To Provide Information to Service Providers.</strong> We
may share your personal information with Service Providers registered
with Redbeacon that perform certain services on behalf of Consumers.
Sharing this information with Service Providers allows them to provide
an accurate Quote on the service you're requesting.  The
information we share is generally the information contained in the
Service Request form, including the username (and first name of the
Consumer when we have it), the type of service needed, when and where
the service should be performed, a description of the service needed,
and any photographs pertaining to the Service Request.  When you
accept a price quote from a Service Provider, additional information
will be shared, including personally identifiable information such as
the your real name, phone number, email address, and street address of
the job location.
</p><p><strong>To Provide Information to Consumers.</strong>  If you are a
registered Service Provider, we may share your personal information
with Consumers requesting services through Redbeacon.  Sharing this
information with Consumers helps them to assess Service Provider
quality and select the Service Provider to perform the service they
need done.  The information we share is generally the information in
your Skill Profile, with the exception of your address, contact phone
number, mobile phone number, and email address.  In addition, we share
the Quote you submitted on the Service Request and any additional
information you chose to provide to the Consumer such as appointment
start times, private notes, and questions about the Service Request.
If you Quote on a job and your Quote is selected by the Consumer,
Redbeacon will then, and only then, share your address, contact phone
number, and email address with the Consumer in order to facilitate
communication about the scheduled job.
</p><p><strong>To Provide Information to Partner Companies.</strong> We may enter into agreements with one or more partner companies pursuant to which we provide a partner company with a URL and a user registration page co-branded with, or private labeled by, the partner company, and the partner company distributes and promotes the URL to its customers. A partner company may want to access personally identifiable information that we collect from its customers.  As a result, if you register on our Website through a partner company, or if you are directed to or access our Website or Website features (such as but not limited to an embedded widget) through a partner company, we may provide your personally identifiable information to the partner company.  Because we do not control the privacy practices of our partner company, you should read and understand its privacy policies.</p><p><strong>To Facilitate Redbeacon's Use of Third-Party Services.</strong>We engage certain trusted third parties to perform
functions and provide services to us, including, without limitation,
hosting and maintenance, customer relationship, database storage and
management, direct marketing campaigns and User credit card
information storage. We will share your personally identifiable
information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary
to perform these functions and provide such services, and only
pursuant to binding contractual obligations requiring such third
parties to maintain the privacy and security of your data.
</p><p><strong>To Comply with Laws and Law Enforcement.</strong> Redbeacon
cooperates with government and law enforcement officials or private
parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any
information about you to government or law enforcement officials or
private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or
appropriate to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas),
to protect the property and rights of Redbeacon or a third party, the
safety of the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal,
unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to comply with the law.
</p><p><strong>In Connection with Business Transfers.</strong> Redbeacon may sell, transfer
or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your
personally identifiable information, in connection with a merger,
acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of
bankruptcy. You will have the opportunity to opt out of any such
transfer if the new entity's planned processing of your information
differs materially from that set forth in this Privacy Policy.
</p><p><strong>To Provide Information to Redbeacon Affiliates.</strong> We may share your
personal information with a company controlled by, or under common
control with, Redbeacon for any purpose permitted by this Privacy
Policy.
</p><p><strong>To Solicit or Provide Advice on Service Provider Selection.</strong>Redbeacon, with your explicit opt-in, may publish a message to your Facebook Wall notifying your friends of your use of the Website and soliciting their advice on which service provider to select for your job.  In addition, with your explicit opt-in, Redbeacon may publish a message to your Facebook Wall if you provide input, recommendations, or advice on another s service provider selection.

your personally identifiable information. We employ administrative,
physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information
from unauthorized access. However, we cannot guarantee that hackers or
unauthorized personnel will not gain access to your personal
information despite our efforts. You should note that in using the
Website, your information will travel through third party
infrastructures which are not under our control.
</p><h2>Links to Other Websites</h2><p>Our Website contains links to other websites. The fact that we link

our affiliation with that third party. We do not exercise control over
third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies
or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personally
identifiable information from you. Other sites follow different rules
regarding the use or disclosure of the personally identifiable
information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy
policies or statements of the other websites you visit.
</p><h2>Children</h2><p>The Website is not directed to persons under 18. If a parent or
guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with
personally identifiable information without the parent or guardian's consent, he or she
should contact us at support [at] redbeacon.com. We do not knowingly
collect personally identifiable information from minors under 18. If
we become aware that a minor under 18 has provided us with personal
identifiable information, we will use reasonable commercial efforts to
promptly delete such information from our files.
