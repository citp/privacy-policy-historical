**Redbell** may also disclose account information in special cases when **Redbell** has reasons to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating I **Redbell** 's Terms of Services or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) **Redbell** 's rights or property, other **Redbell** network website users, or if **Redbell** deems it necessary to maintain, service, and improve its products and services.

**Protection of information**  
As with all information, **Redbell** does not sell any user's personal information or business information until and unless it is permitted by the user. Any user statistics that we may provide to prospective advertisers or partners regarding product or service usage on **Redbell** network is provided in an aggregate form only and does not include any personally identifiable information about any individual user. 

We request our users to sign out of their **Redbell** account and close their browser window when they have finished their work. This is to ensure that others cannot access their personal or business information and correspondence, if the user shares the computer with someone else or is using a computer in a public place. 

**Redbell** takes necessary steps, within its limits of commercial viability and necessity, to ensure that the user's information is treated securely.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while **Redbell** strives to protect the user's personal & business information, it cannot ensure the security of any information transmitted to **Redbell** and you do so at your own risk. Once **Redbell** receives your transmission, it makes best efforts to ensure its security in its systems.
