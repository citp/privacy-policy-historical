We do not share personal information with third parties.

## Information we gather¶

Our webserver creates a logfile with the following non-personally-identifying information that your browser sends on each request:

  * browser type
  * language preference
  * referring site
  * date and time of request



redmine.org also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.

  * the _login name_ you'd like to use
