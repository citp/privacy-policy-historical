						<p>
							RED’s privacy and security measures are designed with the strictest security in mind, so any 
							personal information that you provide to RED is used for the purpose of receiving RED communications 
							and for personalizing and enhancing your web experience with RED. RED’s privacy policy is 
							outlined below and tells you how we collect personal information, what information we collect, 
							how we use it, to whom we will disclose it and how you can access, change and remove your information.
						</p>

						<h5>HOW WE COLLECT THE INFORMATION</h5>
						<p>
							There are many ways that RED may obtain information from you: (1) via signup on any RED website(s); 
							(2) from an online, email, retail, fax or telephone purchase; (3) from navigational information 
							about where visitors go on our website; (4) when you enter an RED sweepstakes/giveaway; (5) anytime 
							you submit a business reply, product, or warranty card; (6) when you sign up at an RED Store; (7) 
							upon contacting customer service to request RED communications; and (8) upon signing up at an event.
						</p>

						<h5>THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h5>
						<p>
							When you register on-line to receive our product information, you will need to provide us with your 
							name, address and e-mail address. When you make a purchase through RED’s website, you also 
							will need to give us your telephone number and credit card number so we can process your payment 
							and contact you in the event of any problems with delivery. If you contact our customer service 
							department, you may need to provide us with additional information so that we can respond to your 
							questions or concerns as completely and thoroughly as possible.
						</p>
						<p>
							In order to provide users and subscribers with the most efficient and enhanced service and to 
							better understand your preferences, we may request your gender, year of birth, sports of interest, 
							shopping preference and product interest. Whether or not you provide this information is entirely 
							up to you.
						</p>
						<p>
							We also may collect additional non-personally identifiable information (for example, browser 
							version, IP address) which will provide information regarding the general use of our website. 
							The navigational information allows us to see which areas of our website are most visited and 
							helps us improve the quality of your online experience by recognizing and delivering more of the 
							most desired features and services.
						</p>

						<h5>HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION</h5>
						<p>
							All personal information that we obtain about you will be recorded, used and protected by us in 
							accordance with current data protection legislation and this privacy policy. By providing us with 
							your personal information, you consent to us processing this personal information in one or more 
							of the ways described in this privacy policy.
						</p>
						<p>We will primarily use your personal information to provide products and services to you, for example:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								To administer a contest, promotion, survey or other site feature and to provide you with 
								the relevant products or services (for instance to deliver a prize you may have won in a contest).
							</li>
							<li>
								To send you information/materials via e-mail or mail about products, offers and news we think could 
								interest you. This information may relate to products, offers and news of RED. We only send you 
								this if you have opted-in to receive RED catalogs or e-mail messages.
							</li>
							<li>
								To analyze visits to the website and learn about the interests of our visitors in the aggregate 
								and to better understand your personal interests and needs, so we can improve our products and 
								services and deliver to you the type of content, features and promotions that you are most 
								interested in.
							</li>
							<li>
								The information obtained from registration on-line is utilized to improve your web experience 
								with RED by enabling you to obtain a faster checkout for purchases and/or opt-in to receive 
								occasional e-mails, which provide you with the latest and greatest information regarding RED 
								and its products.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							The information we ask for when you order on-line is used only to complete the order, to confirm 
							the order and to confirm shipment of the order. You may, upon placement of an order, opt to allow 
							RED to save the information for a speedier checkout process the next time. This information is 
							then stored only for the purposes of faster checkout and is not used for any other purpose.
						</p>

						<h5>COOKIES</h5>
						<p>
							A cookie is a small removable data file that is stored by your web browser on your computer. 
							Cookies are only used by RED to allow you to use RED’s web site in the most efficient manner. 
							Cookies allow you to place an order on our website and allow us to enhance and personalize your 
							online surfing and shopping experience. For example, we use cookies to:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Remember the items in your shopping basket</li>
							<li>Recognize you when you return to our website</li>
							<li>Analyze visitor behavior</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent or you can choose 
							to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings. Please note, however, that 
							by deleting our cookies or disabling future cookies you may not be able to access certain areas 
							or features of our website.
						</p>
						<p>
							We also work with other companies who use tracking technologies, including web beacons, to serve 
							ads on our behalf across the internet. These companies may collect non-personally identifiable 
							information about your visit to our website about your interaction with our communications, 
							including advertising and e-mails. If you object to web beacons, we recommend that you follow 
							the instructions for deleting existing cookies and disabling future cookies. We will still know 
							how many of our e-mails are opened and we will automatically receive your IP address, a unique 
							identifier for your computer or other access device but we will not identify you as an individual.
						</p>

						<h5>SHARING INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES</h5>
						<p>
							RED will never sell any information about you to anyone. We are part of a larger company and we may 
							share information with our parent and affiliated companies.
						</p>
						<p>
							We engage third parties to perform services in connection with the operation of our business. 
							Examples of these services include payment processing and authorization, fraud protection and credit 
							risk reduction, product customization, order fulfillment and shipping, marketing and promotional 
							material distribution, website evaluation, data analysis and, where applicable, data cleansing.
							 We may need to share personal information with these third parties so that they can perform these 
							services, however, we limit the personal information that we give to them and authorize them to 
							use this information only for the purpose of performing those services.
						</p>
						<p>
							In proceeding with your online order, you agree that both your name and address and those of the 
							delivery name and address (if different) will be checked using third parties such as credit agencies. 
							If you are providing a delivery name and address which is not your own you must have that 
							person’s permission to give us their personal information and for us to use it for the 
							purposes specified. By providing it you are saying you have their permission.
						</p>
						<p>
							We share aggregated demographic information about our user base with our agents, including agencies 
							or third party vendors so that they can provide marketing analysis and consult on advertising 
							strategies. This information does not identify individual users. We also may share non-personal 
							information, such as the number of users who visited the website during a specific time period or 
							who purchased a specific product through the website, with our marketing partners, advertisers and 
							others from time to time. This information generally is shared in an aggregated form.
						</p>
						<p>
							We may release personal information if we believe in good faith that: the law or legal process requires 
							it; if we have been advised by counsel; we have received a valid administrative request from a law 
							enforcement agency; or such release is necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of RED, 
							or any of our respective affiliates, business partners, customers or others.
						</p>
						<p>
							As with any business, it is possible that as our business develops, we might go through a business 
							transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, sale of all or a portion of our assets 
							or buying online stores or other assets. In such transactions, information about customers will 
							likely be transferred. You will be notified via a prominent notice on our site for 30 days of any 
							such change in ownership or control of your personal information. You will be deemed to have 
							consented to the transfer of your personally identifiable information to any such successor entity 
							unless you notify us via email to the contrary within the 30 day period.
						</p>

						<p>
							Personal information submitted to or collected through this website may be stored and/or processed 
							in the United States, United Kingdom, Italy or Canada for the purposes described in this privacy 
							policy. By using RED products and services (including our website), you consent to any such 
							transfer of information outside of your country.
						</p>
						<p>
							We do not share, sell or rent to other third parties any personal information that you provide 
							to us, except with your consent or as described in this Privacy Policy.
						</p>

						<h5>E-MAIL</h5>
						<p>
							RED has a company policy not to flood people with e-mail correspondence, but simply to give you 
							periodic information so you can stay up to date on what RED is offering.
						</p>
						<p>
							RED will send e-mails to you only if you ask for them and you can easily unsubscribe at any time 
							you want by calling our customer service department at (949) 206-7900 or by following the 
							instructions contained in the e-mail.
						</p>
						<p>
							RED also uses your e-mail address to confirm your order and to confirm shipment of your order 
							and to respond to any inquiries you make on-line. All e-mails you receive will provide you with 
							information as to how to get off the e-mail mailing list if you so desire.
						</p>

						<h5>DIRECT MAIL</h5>
						<p>
							If you would like to update your mailing information or want your name and address removed from 
							RED’s direct mailing list you can give us a call at (949) 206-7900.
						</p>

						<h5>CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</h5>
						<p>
							If you are under 14, you should surf RED.com only with involvement of a parent or guardian. 
							Although RED does not specifically direct its website, catalogs or e-mails to children, RED strives 
							to provide children with as much customer service as possible without violating their privacy 
							rights. For their protection, RED asks that anyone under 14 years of age not attempt to register 
							with RED or otherwise provide RED with any personal information without the consent of a parent 
							or legal guardian.
						</p>
						<h5>ACCESS TO YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h5>
						<p>
							RED will provide you with access to the personal information you provided to RED by allowing you 
							to view, update or correct your information. In order to protect your privacy, RED takes steps 
							to verify your identity before granting you access to the private information or enabling you 
							to make corrections. RED will accomplish this through the use of passwords and personal data.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you want to find out what personal information RED holds about you, please contact our customer 
							service department at (949) 206-7900. We may charge you a small fee for providing this information.
						</p>

						<h5>SECURITY</h5>
						<p>
							Our web site’s bunker security system is armed with a sentry system to monitor activity 
							and prevent any unauthorized disclosure of credit card numbers or other personal information. 
							In addition, we utilize a licensed system for credit card authorization and fraud detection. We 
							use industry standard SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption to protect the confidentiality of 
							your personal information.
						</p>
						<h5>OPT OUT / UNSUBSCRIBE</h5>
						<p>
							You may request to stop receiving communications from RED at anytime. You can choose to cancel 
							e-mails only, snail mail only or both by calling our customer service department at (949) 206-7900.
						</p>
						<p>
							Also, all e-mails you receive will provide you with information as to how to get off the e-mail 
							mailing list if you so desire.
						</p>
						<p>
							It takes some time to put opt outs in effect so you may still receive catalogs or emails from RED 
							for several weeks after your request is received.
						</p>
						
						<h5>UPDATES TO PRIVACY INFORMATION</h5>
						<p>
							Please review the site periodically to see any updates to the information provided here. This 
							privacy policy was last updated on October 06, 2010.
