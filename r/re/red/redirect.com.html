<li>how you may update the information you provide us,</li> 
<li>and your choices about such uses and disclosures. </li>
</ul>
<p>By reference, this Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Site's Terms of Use. We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use carefully when using our Sites or Services or transacting business with us. By using our Sites, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us by email at legalnotices@mediabreakaway.com or by mail at Redirect.com, a division of Media Breakaway, LLC Attn: Privacy, 1490 W. 121st Ave., Suite 201, Westminster, CO 80234. </p>
<p><b>Information Collection</b></p>
<p>We may collect personal information that can identify you such as your name and e-mail address, as well as other information that does not identify you. When you provide personal information through our Sites, the information may be sent to our servers located in the United States. </p>
<p>User Provided Information. We may collect and store any personal information you enter on our Sites or provide to us in some other manner. This includes identifying information (such as your name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number), and any other personal information you choose to provide while using our Sites or the Services. For example, when you open an account with Redirect.com, we collect certain personal financial information in order to properly process payments to you such as your billing address, bank name and address, and bank account number. </p>
<p>Third Party List Information. We may also obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from third party data gathering sources. We may match this third-party collected information with the personally identifying information that you provide to us. When obtaining this information from third parties, Redirect.com seeks assurances from such third parties that they have the right to provide the information to us. </p>
<p>Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Information Collection Technology. We and our business partners, such as advertisers, may use various technologies to collect information from your computer and about your activities on our Sites. For example, we and our business partners may collect and store non-personally identifying information through technologies such as log files, cookies, web beacons (also known as clear gifs), tracking pixels, and similar technology used by third parties to help determine user viewing preferences for advertising and other purposes. </p>
<ul>
<li>Log Files. Technical information from your browser is automatically collected when you visit our Sites. This information includes your IP address, your browser type, operating system, access times, the content of any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us (see "Cookies" below), and the referring website address. </li>
<li>Cookies. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user's computer that tracks non-personal information about the user. When using our Sites, we may assign your computer one or more cookies which enable us to improve the quality of our Service and to personalize your experience. Cookies allow us to automatically collect information about your activity on our Sites, such as the web pages you visit, the links or advertisements you click, or the other actions you conduct while using our Sites. The cookies do not store any personally identifiable information about you. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to disable cookies. If you choose to disable cookies, you will still be able to access our Sites, but you may not be able to use all of the interactive features we offer. Additional information on cookies can be found at: http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.htm.</li>
<li>Web Beacons. We, or our advertisers, may use standard Internet technology such as web beacons (or "clear gifs"), tracking pixels, and other similar technologies, to gather aggregate, non-personally identifiable information about your use of our Sites. We also may include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and the quality of our Sites. </li>
<li>Information collected by third-parties. We and our business partners, such as advertisers, may use tracking technologies, such as cookies and tracking pixels, to collect information about users who view or interact with these advertisements and connect to other websites. This information allows us and our business partners to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their effectiveness. Please note that we do not have access to or control over third parties' cookies used on our Sites, and this policy does not govern the use of cookies by these third parties. </li>
</ul>
<p>Sponsor or Link Websites. Links or sponsor websites may be presented in a manner that allows us to keep track of whether the links or sponsor sites have been used. We use this information to improve the quality of our Sites, to track advertising, and to personalize your online experience. Please be aware, however, that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites. </p>
<p>No Information From Children. Redirect.com will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13. If we obtain actual knowledge that we have collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database. Because we do not collect such information, we have no such information to use or to disclose to third parties. The Sites target an audience that is over the age of 18 and some content may not be appropriate for all ages. We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet. We have designed our privacy policy in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). </p>
<p><b>Information Use and Sharing</b></p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE THAT WE MAY USE INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION FOR ANY LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION.

<p><b>Choice/Opt-Out</b></p>
<p>We give our users the opportunity to "opt-out" of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our Sites at the point where we ask for the information.

<p><b>Updating Your Information</b></p>
<p>If you have questions or want to update your personal information, please contact us at: legalnotices@mediabreakaway.com or by mail at Redirect.com, a division of Media Breakaway, LLC Attn: Privacy, 1490 W. 121st Ave., Suite 201, Westminster, CO 80234. </p>
