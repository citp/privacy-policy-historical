Privacy Statement

This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for [store.redlion.net](https://store.redlion.net/). If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, please e-mail us at [storemaster@redlion.net](mailto:storemaster@redlion.net).

**We respect your privacy  
**At Red Lion Controls we value our customers and their privacy. All personal information is used to ensure efficient processing of your order. This information is used by our staff and authorized distributors for contacting and identifying customers and their needs. We will not give, sell, rent, or loan any personally identifiable information to any third party, unless we are legally required to do so or you authorize us to do so.

**No SPAMMING!**  
Unsolicited, "spam" mail is not sent to Red Lion Controls customers. The only email customers will receive, are updates to their recent orders and occasional promotions, **if requested**. Customers can be removed from our promotion list at anytime by visiting a link provided within the email.

**Your Personal Information is Secure**

Red Lion Controls uses the industry standard security protocol Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to encode sensitive information like your credit card number that passes between you and [store.redlion.net](https://store.redlion.net/). We employ the latest 128-bit encryption technology in all areas of the site which require you to provide your personal or account information. This means that the credit card information you send is encrypted by your computer, and then decrypted again on our side, preventing others from accessing your private information in between. So, when using an SSL capable browser, shopping on Red Lion Controls’ website is perfectly safe.

If you have any questions regarding Red Lion Controls’ privacy/security pledge, please e-mail us at [storemaster@redlion.net](mailto:storemaster@redlion.net)

More Privacy Terms...

Red Lion Controls has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: **[store.redlion.net](https://store.redlion.net/)**. Any changes or updates to our privacy practices will be updated through our website.

**Log Files**  
We use IP addresses, browser type, and time of day, to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

**Registration**  
Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their name and email address). The customer's contact information is used to contact the visitor in the event of a problem when processing an order. For example, problems with credit card verification, product availability, etc. Users have a choice of receiving future mailings; during the registration process.

Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect visitor's contact information (like their email address), and financial information (like their account or credit card numbers). The customer's contact information is used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary. i.e., in the event there is a problem processing an order, corporate changes, or changes in privacy practices. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services.

**3rd Parties**  
Red Lion Controls is the sole collector of information, and is not shared with any 3rd parties without your specific consent.

**Security**  
This website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing’.

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment.

**Notification of Changes**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
