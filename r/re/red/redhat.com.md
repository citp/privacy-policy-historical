**Red Hat Network Information**  
Our website's registration system requires you to give us some contact information (like a user name or email address) and unique identifiers (like a password). Unique identifiers are collected to verify your identity and are used as account numbers in our record system.

During the registration process you will be given a choice as to whether you would like Red Hat or our business partners to contact you in the future. This is an "opt-in" process. If you opt-in, we rely on your consent to send you information, special offers, and promotional materials. You may choose whether you would like to be contacted via mail, email, phone, or not at all. We will only contact you via the methods you choose. The only exception is the rare case that we find a significant issue with a product or service you have registered that requires your immediate attention. We may contact you via phone or email as the situation warrants. This is for your protection.

A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. All sections of redhat.com where you are prompted to log in or that are customizable require your web browser to accept cookies.

Generally, we use cookies to:

  2. Estimate audience size. Each browser accessing Red Hat is given a unique cookie that is used to determine the extent of repeat usage and usage by a registered user versus by an unregistered user.
  3. Assist the redhat.com store and merchants in the redhat.com Marketplace to track visits and to process the items in your shopping baskets.
  4. Track your progress and number of entries in some of our promotions, sweepstakes, and contests.

  5. Measure certain traffic patterns, which areas of Red Hat's network of websites you have visited, and your visiting patterns in the aggregate. We use this research to understand how our user's habits are similar or different from one another so that we can make each new experience on redhat.com a better one. We may use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions you and other users will see on our sites.
