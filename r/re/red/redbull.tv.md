(Last Update: May 2016)

Introduction

This Red Bull Privacy Policy ("Policy") sets out how Red Bull Media House GmbH, whose registered offices are at Oberst-Lepperdinger-St. 11-15, 5071 Wals near Salzburg, Austria, (hereinafter “Red Bull”, "we". "us", "our") collect and process information about you when you use our mobile applications and games ("Apps"). By continuing to use our Apps, you consent to your information being processed in accordance with this Policy.

Information we collect and how we use it 

What personal information does the App collect and why? When you download and use the Apps, you may be provided with an option to create a user account ("Account"). The information that you provide when setting up your Account may include your name, email address, telephone number and Account username. If you create an Account with us, you will also have a unique password which enables you to access your Account. Alternatively, you can also create an Account using your Facebook, Twitter or Google+ credentials. 

You do not have to log-in to an Account to use the App, however, if you do not we may not be able to personalize your experience, for example we may not be able to save your game progress and you may lose any in-App purchases that you have made once you uninstall the App. You will however be provided with a unique user identification number, which will be visible to you in the App and which you can use for support requests. Any preferences that you make while not logged-in will be saved to your device and may not be accessible by us.

When logging into your Account or using the App, you will give us information that can identify you ("personal information") and you consent to us using for the purposes set out in this Policy. Please note that where you have provided consent in relation to any processing carried out by us through the App, you may withdraw this consent at any time, in which case (unless we have an alternative justification for such processing) we will stop this processing. You can exercise this at any time by contacting us and our contact details are set out in paragraph 14, and you should be aware that once your consent is withdrawn and the App is uninstalled, you will lose your game progress and any in-App purchases that you have made. 

When you use our Apps, we may use your personal information to create specialised recommendations to enhance your user experience. This can include recommending content for you to watch based on your viewing history or Facebook "likes" and interests (as applicable). We will not collect your Facebook, Twitter or Google+ username or password, but we may collect details from these websites that confirm whether you are logged-in to the App using your Facebook, Twitter or Google+ accounts (a "token"). This information is used to access and extract certain information about you from your Facebook, Twitter or Google+ profiles to enhance your user experience and provide you with meaningful content. This is information that you make available to the public on your profile. We do not access your personal account settings.

If you make any in-App purchases, we will also collect your location and payment information. Please note that we will not store your payment information, this will be done via a third party payments company. 

The personal information that you provide to us will also be used for the purposes of enabling you to use our Apps, for administrative and troubleshooting purposes (to determine which parts of the App should be improved) and in order for us to send you marketing materials (should you opt in to receiving marketing material from us). As explained in Section 2.8 below, we may also use this information for further purposes when combined with other data we collect about you.

Information we collect automatically. When you use our Apps, we may automatically collect the following information: your log-in information, location information, operating system version, screen resolution, device processing power and memory, download errors, user behaviour (such as length of App use) and any number of unique identifiers associated with your mobile device, for example an IMEI address (a unique number assigned to mobile phones that is used by GSM networks to help them identify valid mobile devices). We collect information automatically through the use of various technologies, including "unique device identifiers" ("IDs"), and this is explained further below. 

We use the information we collect automatically: (i) to administer our Apps for internal operations including troubleshooting purposes; (ii) to ensure that content from our Apps is presented in the most effective manner for you and your devices; (iii) as part of our effort to keep our Apps safe and secure; (iv) to measure or understand the effectiveness of advertising we serve to you and others, and to deliver relevant advertising to you; and (v) to make suggestions and recommendations to you and other users of our Apps about goods or services that may interest you or them.

Information we receive from other sources. We may receive information about you if you use any of the other services we provide on the Apps, or from other Red Bull entities and affiliates. We are also working closely with third parties (including, for example, business partners, sub-contractors in technical, payment and delivery services, advertising networks, analytics providers, search information providers, credit reference agencies) and may receive information about you from them (including information that is publicly available).

Where permitted by law, we may combine this information we receive from other sources, including from social media websites (as set out above in paragraph 2.4), with information you give to us and information we collect about you, including ID information. We may use this information and the combined information for learning more about your preferences as our customer, for enhancing your user experience on our Apps and for providing you with information, content and offerings tailored to your needs.

How we share and disclose your information

We may share your information with our Red Bull affiliates at http://www.redbull.com/en/affiliates for the purposes outlined in this Policy and with the third parties listed in this Policy. We may also share your information with third parties when: (1) it is necessary to involve a third party service provider in order to facilitate or extend our services; (2) explicitly requested by you (e.g. with social media networks); (3) required by a court order or any legal or regulatory requirement; (4) in connection with the sale or transfer of a business for fulfilling our obligations to you; (5) to enforce our Terms and Conditions; (6) to ensure the safety and security of our users, consumers and third parties; and (7) to protect our rights and property and the rights and property of our guests and third parties.

How to opt in or opt out of direct marketing

We, and selected third parties, may use the information you give us on our Apps for direct marketing purposes to provide updates; newsletters; events; or other communications that we think may interest you. Where required by law, your prior consent will be obtained before sending direct marketing. In any event, we will offer you the option to unsubscribe in every communication sent.

Analysis and Advertising

We use third party tools, including the Turn Audience Suite and related tools provided by Turn to make the advertising we show you on our Apps and/or our partner apps more relevant and interesting to you. For this purpose, we use IDs or similar technologies to collect information about your user behaviour (see sections 2.5 and 2.6 above) and deliver interest-based ads to you. For further information about the use of data by Turn please click on the following link: http://www.turn.com/trust/privacy-guidelines. You may opt-out at any time from the collection and use of your data by Turn by clicking the following link: http://www.turn.com/trust/consumer-opt-out. 

IDs and other technologies

We collect information automatically through the use of IDs. An ID is a specific string of numbers and letters (a "character string") which is assigned to your device, but does not name you. The ID allows us and our selected third parties to track your behaviour when you use the App. Almost every App uses ID technology. IDs serve a number of purposes such as remembering your preferences, and generally improving your user experience. 

IDs may tell us, for example, whether you have used our Apps before or whether you are a new user. They can also help to ensure that adverts you see through the Apps are more relevant to you and your interests. This functionality makes IDs extremely useful to improve your user experience. 

What types of IDs do we use?

We use different categories of IDs (such as Adverting IDs and Analytics IDs) which fulfil important functions within the App. You may disable these IDs via your mobile device settings or by using the links provided in the list below, however, there are two broad categories of IDs. IDs that are essential for the operation of Apps, also known as Strictly Necessary IDs, enable features without which you would not be able to use Apps as intended. Your consent is not required for the use of Strictly Necessary IDs, which is why Strictly Necessary IDs cannot be disabled using the features of or the links on App. However, you have the option to completely disable IDs in your device at any time. The other category of IDs are IDs which, in strictly legal terms, are not essential to use the Apps. Nevertheless, these IDs do still fulfil important functions. You may disable any of these IDs via your mobile device settings or by using the links provided in the list below. However, if you do so this may prevent certain features or services of the Apps from working properly and therefore affect your experience whilst using the Apps. The list below shows the full range of IDs we may use with our Apps, however most of our Apps will not use all of these IDs. Whether or not an ID is used in each App will be based on developer preferences. 

The specific types of IDs and other technologies that may be served through the Apps are described below: 

Type of ID Who serves them Click on the following links to block the IDs

Strictly Necessary IDs 

These IDs are necessary to provide you with services available through Apps and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Without these IDs, services you have asked for, like a personalised App function, would not be possible. 

Red Bull 

Not applicable.

Advertising IDs. 

These IDs are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you. They perform functions like preventing the same advertisements from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests.

Social Media Plug-ins. 

On some parts of the Apps, third parties that provide applications through our Apps may insert their own technology ("plug-ins") in order to track the success of their applications or customize applications for you. For example, when you share a game score using a social media sharing button on an App (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, or Google Plus), the social network that has created the button will record that you have done this. Because of how these plug-ins work, we cannot access this technology, nor can the third parties access the data in the IDs used by us. Some parts of our Apps may also contain embedded content, such as video content from YouTube, and these sites may set their own IDs or plug-ins. Facebook If you want to prevent this, you must first log out of your Facebook account before activating the Facebook plug-in, or alternatively disable all Facebook settings on your device when using the App. https://www.facebook.com/policy.php 

Twitter Log out of your Twitter account before activating the Twitter plug-ins, or alternatively and then disable all Twitter settings on your device when using the App. 

http://twitter.com/privacy

Google+ Do not log in to the App using your Google+ or Google account. 

http://www.google.com/intl/policies/policies/privacy/

The Apps may make use of GPS tracking in order to provide you with location-based functions and the Apps may also access the photos and videos that you store on your mobile device to allow you to upload videos and photos for use within the Apps. Finally, the Apps may use push notifications to send you notifications, for example the App may send you a notification when another player beats your high score. When you first use the App, you will be asked if you want to activate these functions in your settings menu. If you choose not to activate these functions, or to deactivate them later on, you may not be able to use the App's full scope of services. 

You can also refuse advertising IDs in the settings of your respective operating system. If you need assistance with this, please email us at the address set out at paragraph 14.

Since your ID and plug-in opt-out preferences can be stored on your device, please also note that if you use a different device, you will need to renew your opt-out choices. 

Data Retention

We will not retain your information for longer than is necessary for our business purposes or for legal requirements. However, please be advised that we may retain some information after you have closed your Account with us, for instance if doing so is necessary to meet our legal obligations, such as retaining the information for tax and accounting purposes. 

Please also note that any information held by third parties will be subject to the terms of their privacy policy and that we will have no control over that information.

Your rights

If you wish to obtain a copy of personal information that we hold about you, please contact us at the address set out in paragraph 14 below. Before responding to your request, we may ask you to verify your identity and to provide further details about your request. We will endeavour to respond within an appropriate timeframe and, in any event, within any timescales required by law.

If you have chosen to have an Account then you can access the personal information we hold about you via your Account following the process as set out in paragraph 9.1above to obtain a copy of it and to correct, amend, or delete information that is inaccurate. You can also close your Account at any time by contacting us at the address set out in paragraph 14.

It is your responsibility to ensure that you submit true, accurate and complete information to your Account and keep it up to date. You may also update your personal information by contacting us, using the contact details provided below. Please make sure to include your name, username and post code in your initial correspondence; this helps us protect the details and preferences on your Account from unauthorised access.

Information security

We apply appropriate security measures to protect your personal information that is under our control from unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification or disposal. All information you provide to us is stored on secure servers. 

However, please note that no transmission over the Internet or any public network can ever be guaranteed completely secure, and we cannot accept any liability for any security compromise to transmissions over such networks. Where you have a password, which enables you to access our Apps, you are responsible for keeping this password secure and confidential.

Internet-based transfers

Given that the Internet is a global environment, using the Internet to collect and process personal information necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis. While we generally store all of the personal information that we collect about you through our Apps in your region (for example for European visitors, in the European Economic Area), it is possible that your personal information will be transmitted to parties outside your region (where data protection laws may be different). If such transfer happens, we ensure that it takes place in compliance with contractual or other measures to protect the information.

Use of this Apps by minors

If you are aged 15 or under, please get your parent's/guardian's permission before you provide information to us via our Apps. Users without this consent are not allowed to provide us with information and, in the event that they do so, we will cease to process their information as soon as we find out. 

Changes to the Policy

You may find the latest version in the Privacy area under the settings menu of the App. We reserve the right to review and revise this Policy from time to time, in particular to satisfy the requirements of providers of platforms for the distribution of applications. We will inform you about any such change and we will provide you with a then current version of the Policy ("New Policy").
