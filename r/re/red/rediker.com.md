This Privacy Policy applies to the personal information we may obtain through [www.rediker.com](https://www.rediker.com/) (the Website).

We may combine Personal Information with other information, in which case we will treat the combined information as Personal Information. We also may combine information that we collect about you with additional information that we or third parties collect in other contexts—such as our communications with you via email or phone, or your customer service records. In those circumstances, we will treat the combined information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

####   
How do we protect your information?

We offer a high-level of security and have implemented policies and procedures to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of users’ personal information. No system for safeguarding personal or other information is 100 percent secure. However, we take many steps to safeguard the security of personal information. Our firewalls are configured in redundancy to protect the flow of outbound and inbound traffic with real-time scanning. We employ IPS/IDS (Intrusion Prevention System/Intrusion Detection System) for deep traffic inspection and have rules in place to block threats. We use Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) which provides authentication and strong encryption.

#### Third-Party Analytics and Targeted Advertising

We partner with certain third parties to collect information to engage in analytics, auditing, research, and reporting. These third parties may use web logs, or similar online tracking mechanisms, and they may set and access cookies on your computer or other device.

The Website uses [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html) to help collect and analyze certain information for the purposes discussed above. You may opt out of the use of cookies by Google Analytics [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). The Website may also enable third-party tracking mechanisms to collect information on our Website over time, and across unaffiliated websites, for use in online behavioral advertising. For example, Google AdWords may use the fact that you visited the Website to target online ads for Rediker products and services to you on websites that are part of the Google Ad Network. To control your settings for the Google Ad Network, click [here](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en#display_optout).

The use of online tracking mechanisms by third parties is subject to those third parties’ own privacy policies, and not this Privacy Policy. If you prefer to prevent third parties from setting and accessing cookies on your computer, you may set your browser to block cookies.

**Note** : If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, please email webmaster@rediker.com and include the word UNSUBSCRIBE in the subject line, or follow the UNSUBSCRIBE link at the bottom of our emails.

#### Do we disclose any information to outside parties?

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect our or others' rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses. In no case will we sell or license personal information to third parties, except as required or permitted by law. For example, we may sell, assign or share personal information in connection with certain business transactions, such as the acquisition of all or substantially all our company assets. In such cases, we will take appropriate steps under the circumstances and to the extent possible to ensure that the recipient agrees to provide privacy protections substantially similar to those established by this Policy.

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits you to request information regarding the disclosure of your personal information by certain members of the Company to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Requests may be made one time per calendar year. If applicable, this information would include the categories of customer information and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we shared customer information for the immediately prior calendar year (e.g., requests made in 2018 will receive information regarding 2017 sharing activities). You may submit your request using the contact information at the end of this Policy. If you are a California resident under the age of 18, and a registered user of any site where this policy is posted, California law permits you to request and obtain removal of content or information you have publicly posted. You may submit your request using the contact information at the end of this Policy. Please be aware that such a request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information you have posted and that there may be circumstances in which the law does not require or allow removal even if requested.

Please note that due to technical reasons there will likely be a delay in accessing or deleting your Personal Information from our systems if you request it. We also will retain Personal Information in order to comply with the law, protect our and others’ rights, resolve disputes or enforce our legal terms or policies, to the extent permitted under applicable law.
