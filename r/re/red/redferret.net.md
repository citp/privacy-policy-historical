# Our Privacy Policy | The Red Ferret Journal

The Red Ferret is absolutely committed to protecting your privacy. We hate anything underhand or dishonest, so we will not sell, rent or otherwise dispose of your personal information to anyone else, ever. The only personal information we collect about you comes from stuff you expressly give us (like your email address or website address) and we use things like browser cookies which help us track visitor traffic every day.

If you would like to find out how Google advertising cookies are used, please [click here](http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/partners/).

The reason we need this stuff is to try and make The Ferret a better and more enjoyable site, so we take it that you automatically consent to this kind of general data gathering through your use of our site.

In order to continue providing free high quality content to our readers, we are paid by advertisers for banner, text and retail affiliate link ads if you purchase something as a result of clicking through from our site. We warrant that this in no way influences our editorial integrity or the quality of our posts. We believe that writing honest, truthful content will earn your trust as a valued reader, and is far more important than simply making a financial gain. We exist to please our readers, and that is what we aim for constantly.

Advertising data

We also feature some of that new fangled [behavioural advertising](http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/faq.aspx) from companies like Google. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. You can find out more by [clicking here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/). In addition we run a contextual affiliate marketing link system, which means we may earn commission on sales of those products or services we feature on the Ferret. You can read more about this [here](http://skimlinks.com/privacy-policy). We are NEVER influenced by advertisers or an affiliate partnership to write favourably about a product or service and we will never write a post solely in order to profit financially from promoting a particular company.

If we need to alter our privacy policy, we will post the changes to this page to keep you updated as to what information we are collecting, how we are using it and if and why we may disclose it to a third party. That’s kind of weasly talk to say that sometime in the future we may need to supply aggregate data to third parties about our traffic levels, patterns, and other relevant site wide information in order to obtain services or products we need. We’ll never disclose personal identifying information in any case, just generalised statistics.

Bottom line? We really try to be straight about everything we do. We also hate spammers, unsolicited marketing attacks and other nasty stuff which can arise from the indiscriminate disclosure of people’s information. So we’re going to stand side by side with you and fight off the hordes with our bare hands if needs be. We will fight them on the beaches…. _[Enough! – Ed]_
