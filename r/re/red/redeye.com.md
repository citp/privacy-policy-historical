# Privacy Policy - @RedEyeUK

At RedEye we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting the confidentiality of your personal information. Our aim is to be as clear and open as possible about what we do and why. At www.RedEye.com, visitor information will be:

  * Private: We will never sell, rent or trade information about you to other companies.
  * Secure: In accordance with the UK Data Protection Act we follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information that you have given us to prevent unauthorised access.
  * Necessary: We won’t collect information unless it is used to deliver a better service or to give you useful, relevant information.



We receive information about you in two ways:

  * Directly from you: www.RedEye.com offers the opportunity for its visitors to submit their details via a form (e.g. to request further information or download a resource). The purpose of collecting personal data is to deliver a better service or to provide you with information on products and services that you have asked for or that we think you’ll find useful.

## What are cookies? 

A cookie is a small non-executable text file that is placed on your computer when you browse a website.

Our cookies don’t hold any personal or confidential information about you. Most browsers are set to automatically accept cookies. For more information [read our cookie policy](http://www.redeye.com/company/about-us/cookie-policy/).
