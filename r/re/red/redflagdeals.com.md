### The Manner of Collection 

The Companies do not automatically gather personal information from individuals who visit the Companies' Websites. Such information is only obtained if you supply it voluntarily. You should, however, be aware that when you share personal information in public areas on our Websites, this information may be seen and used by other users of our Websites. We urge all users of our Websites to exercise good judgment when sharing personal information in these public areas. Additionally, you are not required to provide any personal information in order to have access to the Companies' Website. 

The manners in which the Companies may collect your information online are: 

  * By using software that receives and records information about your computer, including the Internet Protocol address of the computer that has contacted our Websites. We, however, will not link these addresses with the identity of the individuals visiting our Websites. 
  * By using cookies to track user traffic patterns. A cookie is a small data file that certain Websites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you have visited, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie cannot read data from your hard disk or read cookie files created by other Websites. The Companies do not correlate this information with data about individual users, nor does it share this information or sell it to third parties. We may use this data to tailor your experience on our Websites, by showing you content that we think you may be interested in, and displaying content according to your preferences, or to measure your use of our Websites and to improve the content of our Web sites. If you prefer not to receive cookies from our Websites, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser. Please be advised, however, that this may affect the areas of the Websites that are accessible to you or your browsing experience. 
  * By using service providers to serve third party advertisements on our Websites or the Companies' advertisements on other Websites. In serving advertisements these providers may place cookies on your computer and may collect certain anonymous information about your visits to other Websites or on our Websites. This information may include browser type, Internet Protocol address, domain name and the address of the web page from which you entered our Websites, Web activity and time of day. This information is used to better understand and optimize our online advertising campaigns. From time to time, we analyze traffic patterns on our Websites to determine which features and services are preferred so that we can improve our services. To opt-out of these cookies please review the privacy policies of these particular Websites and follow the opt-out instructions. We prepare aggregated user statistics or information summaries in order to describe our services to third parties such as prospective business partners and advertisers and for other lawful purposes. 



### Sharing of Personal Information with Third Parties

Personal information may be shared with our agents, third party contractors, credit reporting agencies, partners or suppliers in connection with the services that they perform for us. Our written agreements with these companies, however, ensure that the personal information we supply may only be used for the purposes for which it was shared and that it is handled in accordance with a privacy policy at least as rigorous as this policy. In addition, we will also disclose your personal information if we are required to do so by law. 

### Consent

Prior to collecting your personal information, we will ensure that we have your consent to collect, use and disclose your information for a particular purpose. Once your consent is obtained, your personal information will be used solely for the purposes for which you consented. In the event that we wish to use your personal information for another purpose, we will seek your consent once again. 

When you provide us with personal information to complete a sale or other transaction, or to verify your credit, we assume you consent to our collecting it and using it for that specific reason only. 

If we ask you for personal information for a secondary reason, for example for marketing purposes, we will either ask you directly for your consent or provide you with an opportunity to opt-out of the collection of your information. By opting out, you can tell us not to collect the information and/or not to share it with other companies. The Companies Websites provide you with the opportunity to opt-out at each point that your contact information is requested. You also have the ongoing option to remove your contact information from our database in the future if you do not wish to receive future communications or services offered through our Websites. Additionally, you may also choose to withdraw your consent to the collection, use or disclosure of your personal information by sending an email to [privacy@ypg.com](mailto:privacy@ypg.com). Your consent may only be withdrawn subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. 

In addition, where permitted or required by law, we may collect, use or disclose your personal information without your express consent, for example, to collect a debt you owe us, to comply with a legally permitted inquiry by a government agency, or to comply with a court order. 

You are not required to supply personal information in order to view the content of any of the Companies' Websites. If you decide not to consent to our collection, use or disclosure of your personal information, no material consequences will result, unless such information is necessary for the completion of a transaction or for a particular service, such as your participation in a contest. 

### Safeguards

The Companies take all the necessary safeguards to protect the personal information you supply us. 

**Employee Access to Customer Information**

Employee access to your personal information is strictly limited to those who have a need to know. Employees only have access to information that is necessary to process transactions as part of their job requirements. 

**Storage of Personal Information**

_Paper Files_

The Companies collect certain information in paper files, such as: name, street address, postal code, phone number, email address, credit card number, credit card expiry date, banking information and credit record. In order to protect these files, the Companies place them in a locked cabinet or a restricted area. 

_Electronic Files_

The Companies collect certain information in electronic files, such as: name, street address, postal code, phone number, email address, date of birth/age, gender, online behaviour, purchase history, product/service preferences, customer satisfaction information, opinions about products and services and interests and hobbies. The Companies have enacted technological safeguards to ensure the protection of your personal information in electronic format, such as: computer passwords, firewalls, encrypted data files, encrypted personal information, and electronic audit trails. Additionally, laptops, USB keys and electronic wireless devices that have the capacity to store a large quantity of customer information are password protected and only accessible strictly to a limited number of employees who have a need to know this information. 

Where practicable, the Companies ensure that the information they possess about you is not identifiable. This is accomplished by storing the information that clearly identifies you, such as your surname, on a separate database from the one that contains the information that is not personally identifiable, such as your age or sex. Moreover, the information contained on the server which contains personally identifiable information is only accessible to a limited number of employees. 

### Third Party Websites

If links are provided from our Websites to Websites of third parties, the Companies take no responsibility for these third party Websites and the manner in which these sites collect, use and disclose your personal information. The Companies do not endorse, in any manner whatsoever, or accept any responsibility for the information, content or other material which may be contained on third party Websites. We therefore encourage you to review the privacy policies of these Websites before disclosing your information to any third party Website. 

### Retention

The Companies do not retain your personal information for any longer than is strictly necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected. 

### Access and Accuracy

We do our best to keep files containing personal information as complete, up-to-date and accurate as necessary for the identified purpose(s). Upon written request, the Companies will provide you with access to your personal information, subject to certain exceptions as provided by the applicable legislation. If you notice any errors or omissions in your personal information, please advise us in writing and we will promptly correct such errors where appropriate. 

### Policy Changes

We reserve the right to change and update this Policy, including as may be required by law. We encourage you to review our policy from time to time to ensure that you are aware of any changes we may have made.
