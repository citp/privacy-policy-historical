At Red Letter Days we are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect about you to process orders, bookings and brochure requests. Please read on for details about our privacy policy. 

### Controllers of personal information

Any personal information provided or to be gathered at redletterdays.co.uk is controlled by Red Letter Days, 77 Muswell Hill, Muswell Hill, London, N10 3RE. 

### What information do we collect? How do we use it?

When you request a brochure, we need to know your name, address and email address. This allows us to process and fulfil your request. 

We also ask for your telephone number, which enables us to contact you urgently if there is a problem with your request. 

When you order, we need to know your name, address, email address, recipient name and delivery address. This allows us to process and fulfil your order and to notify you of the status of your order. 

We also ask for your telephone number, which enables us to contact you urgently if there is a problem with your order. 

When you book an experience, we need you know your name, address, email address, answers to any questions required by our experience partners, and a telephone number (preferably mobile) so that we can contact you if there are any last-minute changes to your experience. We will also email you answers to any online booking questions submitted and responses to booking date requests. If you provide us with a mobile phone number, we will send you an SMS reminder the day before you are due to take part in your experience. 

Throughout each of these processes, when you login to or create an account, you are able to choose whether you wish to receive further information from us and the method by which you would like to receive it (email, post, telephone and/or SMS). 

### How does Red Letter Days protect customer information?

When you place orders or request a brochure, we use a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, as required by the UK Data Protection Legislation, we follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information, which you have given us, to prevent unauthorised access. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we are able to disclose sensitive information to you. 

### Red Letter Days' use of cookies

We do not use cookies for collecting customers' personal data from the site. Red Letter Days and our online advertising management partners do use cookies to track whether our customers have been referred to us by online advertisements. This enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website. The information collected is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address. 

### Will Red Letter Days disclose the information it collects to outside parties?

Red Letter Days does not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others unless you choose to receive information from trusted third parties when you create or login to your account, in which case you will receive this information until such time as you choose to opt out of receiving these communications.

Red Letter Days may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information. 

We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.

Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mails, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analysing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments and providing customer services. Such companies and individuals will have access to personal information needed to perform these functions, but may not use it for any other purposes and are required to process the data in accordance with the UK's Data Protection legislation.

Customers who submit reviews to us via our feedback page must confirm that they have written their reviews based on their own opinions and experiences and that the information contained in their reviews are factual.

Any material considered inappropriate or offensive will not be published or will be amended.

By submitting a review, customers grant us permission to publish it online or via print media and, if necessary, edit it for clarity and typos.

We never publish a reviewer’s name in full (Christian name and surname initial only).

### In summary
