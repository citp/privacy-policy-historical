  * The categories of Personal Information we collected about you.

    * disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the Personal Information categories that each category of recipient obtained.



You have the right to request that we correct or delete any of your Personal Information we collected and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see Exercising Your Rights and Choices), we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your Personal Information from our records, unless an exception applies.

We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:

  1. Complete the transaction for which we collected the Personal Information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, fulfill the terms of a written warranty or product recall conducted in accordance with federal law, or otherwise perform our contract with you.
  2. Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.
  3. Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.
  4. Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.
  5. Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 et. seq.).
  6. Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research’s achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.
  7. Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.
  8. Comply with a legal obligation.
  9. Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.



## EXERCISING YOUR RIGHTS AND CHOICES

To exercise the access, correction, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:

  * Calling us at 1-800-261-0326.
  * Emailing us at [dataprivacy@redwingshoes.com](mailto:dataprivacy@redwingshoes.com?subject=I%20have%20a%20question%20about%20my%20privacy%20rights).
  * Visiting [www.redwingshoes.com](https://www.redwingshoes.com/) and clicking on the DO NOT SELL MY PERSONAL INFORMATION link at the bottom of the webpage.



Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your Personal Information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.

You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.

The verifiable consumer request must:

  1. Provide sufficient information to allow us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative, which may include: 
    * For non-sensitive information with a low risk of harm: Matching at least two data points you provide with information we hold.
    * For sensitive information with a high risk of harm: Matching at least three pieces of Personal Information you provide with Personal Information we hold.
    * A signed declaration under penalty of perjury from you stating that you are the consumer whose Personal Information is the subject of the request.
  2. Describe your request with sufficient detail to allow us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to your request.



We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you.

Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.

We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.

For instructions on exercising sale opt-out rights, see Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights.

### Our Response and Its Format.

We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time up to forty-five (45) additional days (or ninety (90) days total), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.

We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.

Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

### Your Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights.

If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not sell your Personal Information at any time (the “Right to Opt-Out”). We do not sell the Personal Information of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the “Right to Opt-In”) from either the consumer who is at least 13 but not yet 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age.2 Consumers who opt-in to Personal Information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.

To exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us by visiting the following Internet Web page link:

[DO NOT SELL MY PERSONAL INFORMATION](https://redwingshoes.com/do-not-sell-my-personal-information)

Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales. However, you may change your mind and opt back in to personal information sales at any time by:

  * Calling us at 1-800-261-0326.
  * Emailing us at [dataprivacy@redwingshoes.com.](mailto:dataprivacy@redwingshoes.com?subject=Do%20Not%20Sell%20my%20Personal%20Information)



You do not need to create an account with us to exercise your opt-out rights. We will only use Personal Information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.

## NON-DISCRIMINATION RIGHTS.

We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under this Policy or applicable law.

Unless permitted by law, we will not:

  * Deny you goods or services.
  * Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
  * Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
  * Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.



However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the law that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any legally permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your Personal Information's value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.

## THIS PRIVACY POLICY MAY CHANGE.

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will not reduce your rights without your explicit consent. We will indicate the date the last changes were published, and we will offer access to archived versions for your review.
