								Policy</b><br>
								<br>
								This website (the "www.RedZee.com") is owned and
								operated by RedZee Search Inc. RedZee
								(collectively, "RedZee" or "we") are committed
								to respecting your online privacy and recognize
								your need for appropriate protection and
								management of any personally identifiable
								information ("Personal Information") you share
								with us. RedZee has established this Privacy
								Policy to let you know what information we may
								collect from you on the site and how we may use
								that information. Please take a moment to review
								the terms of our Privacy Policy. By using the
								Site (including RedZee's “RedZee” search engine
								and any other services offered on the Site), you
								agree to accept the terms of our Privacy Policy.
								If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy
								Policy, please do not use the site or our
								services. This Privacy Policy applies only to
								information that we collect on the site (or
								otherwise through our search engine) and does
								not apply to information which we may collect by
								other means. <br>
								<br>
								Personal Information Information We May Collect<br>
								<br>
								Personal Information means any information that
								may be used to identify an individual,
								including, but not limited to, a first and last
								name, a home or other physical address and an
								email address. In general, you can visit the
								Site and use its search engine and other
								features without telling us who you are or
								revealing any Personal Information about
								yourself. However, in order to access certain
								information, services or features contained on
								the Site, we may require you to provide Personal
								Information. For example, we will collect
								certain Personal Information if you choose to
								subscribe to our mailing list or send questions
								or comments to us via e-mail.<br>
								<br>
								How We May Use Your Information<br>
								<br>
								Some of our web pages utilize "cookies" and
								other tracking technologies. A cookie is a small
								text file that a website transfers to an
								individual's hard drive for record-keeping
								purposes. Cookies may be used, for example, to
								collect information about website activity. Most
								browsers allow you to control cookies, including
								whether or not to accept them and how to remove
								them. You may set most browsers to notify you if
								you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block
								cookies with your browser. However, please be
								aware that some features of the Site may not
								function properly or may be slower if you refuse
								cookies. You may occasionally get cookies from
								our advertisers or other third parties with
								links on the Site. We do not control these
								cookies. The use of advertising cookies sent by
								third-party servers is standard in the Internet
								industry. We do not link the information we
								store in cookies to any personally identifiable
								information you submit while on our site.<br>
								<br>
								Tracking technologies may record information
								such as Internet domain and host names; Internet
								protocol (IP) addresses; browser software and
								operating system types; click stream patterns;
								and dates and times that our Site is accessed.
								We do not link the information we record using
								tracking technologies to any personally
								identifiable information you submit while on our
								site.<br>
								<br>
								Search Engine<br>
								<br>
								When you use our search engine, we may collect
								certain non-personally identifiable information
								through the use of cookies and other tracking
								technologies described above. For example, when
								you use our search engine, we may keep track of
								which search terms are popular. If we display
								advertising to you on the Site (including the
								search results pages displayed after any
								searches you may run), such advertising may be
								related to the search terms you entered. RedZee
								may present search result links in a format that
								enables us to understand whether they have been
								followed and may monitor clicks on an individual
								and an aggregate basis. We use this information
								to understand and improve the quality of
								RedZee's search technology. For instance, this
								data helps us determine how often users are
								satisfied with the first result of a query and
								how often they proceed to later results.<br>
								<br>
								Links to Other Sites<br>
								<br>
								Please be aware that when you are on the site,
								you could be directed to other sites that are
								beyond our control. For example, when you use
								our search engine, the search results will
								provide links to other sites from the Site's
								pages that take you outside the Site. These
								other sites may send their own cookies to
								visitors, collect data or solicit Personal
								Information. The privacy policies of these other
								sites may be significantly different from this
								Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the
								privacy practices of these other sites and
								cannot guarantee the security of any of your
								Personal Information collected there.<br>
								<br>
								Security<br>
								<br>
								Wherever your Personal Information may be held
								within RedZee or on its behalf, we intend to
								take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect
								the Personal Information that you share with us
								from unauthorized access or disclosure.
								Unfortunately, no data transmission over the
								Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As
								a result, while we strive to protect your
								Personal Information and privacy, we cannot
								guarantee or warrant the security of any
								information you disclose or transmit to us
								online and cannot be responsible for the theft,
								destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your
								Personal Information.<br>
								<br>
								Updating Your Information<br>
								<br>
								To the extent that you do provide us with
								Personal Information, RedZee wishes to maintain
								accurate Personal Information. If we collect
								Personal Information from you on the Web, you
								may send updates and corrections about your
								Personal Information to privacy@RedZee.com and
								we will make reasonable efforts to incorporate
								the changes in your Personal Information that we
								hold as soon as practicable.<br>
								<br>
								Children's Privacy<br>
								<br>
								Redzee.com is not structured to attract
								children. Accordingly, we do not knowingly
								collect Personal Information from anyone under
								13 years of age. If you are under the age of 13,
								please do not provide any Personal Information
								to us.<br>
								<br>
								Changes to Our Privacy Policy<br>
								<br>
								The terms of this Privacy Policy may change from
								time to time without prior notice to you, so
								please check this page periodically for any
								changes. By checking the "Last Modified" date
								above, you can determine if this Privacy Policy
								has been updated since your last visit to the
								Site. Your continued use of the Site following
								the posting of changes to these terms will mean
								you accept those changes.<br>
								<br>
								Governing Law<br>
								<br>
								This Privacy Policy and the privacy practices of
								RedZee will be subject exclusively to the laws
								of the State of Florida within the United States
								of America. RedZee makes no representation that
								this Privacy Policy and such practices comply
								with the laws of any other country. Visitors who
								use the Site, the search engine or any other
								services offered on the Site and reside outside
								the United States do so on their own initiative
								and are responsible for compliance with local
								laws, if and to the extent local laws are
								applicable.<br></span></span></div>
