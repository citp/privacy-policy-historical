		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
		<div class="p10 w65p">
		This privacy policy was created in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses 
		the information gathering and dissemination practices for this web site.
		<h2>Information Automatically Logged</h2>
		This site uses your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our site. This site 
		records the browser type to monitor market penetration of various web browsers so we can better determine the 
		Internet technologies we may utilize in the design of our pages. This site uses page referrer data — that is, 
		information about the page that linked you to this page — to determine to what extent our page is referenced by 
		other resources on the Web. This data may be used to preserve the integrity of our computing resources.
		<h2>Personal Information</h2>
		Redz.com collects your name and email address, Internet Protocol (IP) address, and other pertinent information.
		This information is used to facilitate buying and selling of links/advertisements on the Internet.
		Unless requested by law enforcement personnel or required by legal process, we will not share any personal 
		information with any third parties nor will we use any personal information for any purposes beyond those stated here.
		<h2>Cookies</h2>
		Some of our web pages utilize "e;cookies"e; and other tracking technologies. A cookie is a small text file that a 
		website transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies may be used, for example, to 
		collect information about website activity. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to 
		accept them and how to remove them. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may 
		choose to block cookies with your browser. However, please be aware that some features of the Site may not function 
		properly or may be slower if you refuse cookies. You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers or other 
		third parties with links on the Site. We do not control these cookies. The use of advertising cookies sent by 
		third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any 
		personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.
		<br><br>
		Tracking technologies may record information such as Internet domain and host names; Internet protocol (IP) 
		addresses; browser software and operating system types; click stream patterns; and dates and times that our Site is 
		accessed. We do not link the information we record using tracking technologies to any personally identifiable 
		information you submit while on our site.
		<h2>Session Management</h2>
		This site uses form elements and/or cookies on each page to maintain a continuous user session. Form elements and/or 
		cookies may contain a unique ID that identifies your browser session. Cookies are a technology which can be used to 
		provide you with tailored information from a Website. A cookie is an element of data that a Website can send to your 
		browser, and which your browser may then store on your system. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive 
		a cookie. Doing this will allow you to decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept cookies or not. Cookies on 
		this site are used by ourselves, our ad management system, and occasionally by advertisers who use 3rd party ad serving 
		solutions. Cookies are used for:

		               <li>ad tracking,</li>
		   
		               <li>customization of content (i.e. not repeating pop-up windows),</li>
		               
		               <li>storing login information, and</li>
		               
		               <li>statistical site-traffic analysis.</li>
		            </ul>
		         </div>
		<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
		Please be aware that when you are on the site, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. 
		For example, when you use our search engine, the search results will provide links to other sites from the Site's 
		pages that take you outside the Site. These other sites may send their own cookies to visitors, collect data or 
		solicit Personal Information. The privacy policies of these other sites may be significantly different from this 
		Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites and cannot guarantee the 
		security of any of your Personal Information collected there.
		<h2>Security</h2>

		from anyone under 13 years of age. If you are under the age of 13, please do not provide any Personal Information 
		to us.
		<h2>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h2>
		The terms of this Privacy Policy may change from time to time without prior notice to you, so please check this page 
		periodically for any changes. By checking the "e;Last Modified"e; date above, you can determine if this Privacy Policy 
		has been updated since your last visit to the Site. Your continued use of the Site following the posting of changes 
		to these terms will mean you accept those changes.

		of Florida within the United States of America. Redz.com makes no representation that this Privacy Policy and 
		such practices comply with the laws of any other country. Visitors who use the Site, the search engine or any
