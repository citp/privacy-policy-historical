<p><b style="color:#FFF; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:14px;">6. Social Plugins</b></p>
<p>Our Website uses social plugins ("Plugins") from the social networks facebook.com ("Facebook"), plus.google.com ("Google +") and micro-blogging service twitter.com ("Twitter").</p>
<p><strong>Facebook&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>is a social network, operated by Facebook Inc. (1601 S. California Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA). When You visit a page of Our Website that contains a Facebook Plugin, Your browser establishes a direct connection to Facebook servers. Facebook directly transfers the Plugin content to Your browser, which embeds the latter into the Website, enabling Facebook to receive information about Your having accessed the respective page of Our Website. We have no influence on the data gathered by the Plugin and inform You according to Our state of knowledge.</p>
<p>If You are logged into Facebook, Your visit can be assigned to Your Facebook account. If You interact with the Plugins, for example by clicking “Like”, or by entering a comment, the corresponding information is transmitted from Your browser directly to Facebook and stored by it. If You are a Facebook member and do not want Facebook to connect the data concerning Your visit to Our Website with Your member data already stored by Facebook, please log off Facebook before entering Our Website. Even if You are not logged into Facebook, there is possibility that the Plugins transmits Your IP-address to Facebook. For the information on the purpose and scope of data collection and procession by Facebook, as well as Your rights in this respect and settings options for protecting your privacy please visit Facebook's privacy policy: www.facebook.com/policy.php. Further You can block Facebook Plugins by using add-ons for Your browser, like the “Facebook Blocker“.</p>
<p><strong>Google +</strong></p>
<p>is a social network that is operated by Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA). When You visit a page of Our Website that contains such a Plugin, Your browser connects directly with the servers of Google. The content of the Plugin is transmitted directly to Your browser from Google, which is then used to incorporate it into the website. We therefore have no influence on the extent of data that Google collects through the Plugin. According to Google, if one does not click on the Plugin, no personal data is collected. Such data, including the IP address, is only collected and processed for logged-in members. If You are a Google + member and do not wish for Google to use Our Internet presence as a way to collect information about You and to link this information with the membership data about You which Google has stored, then you must log out of Google + before visiting Our Website. The purpose and extent of data collection, the further processing and use of data by Google, as well as Your rights in this regard and the various possible settings to protect Your privacy are to be found in Google's data protection guidelines concerning the Plugin: www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/</p>
<p><strong>Twitter&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>is a micro-blogging service, provided by Twitter Inc. (795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA). When You visit a page on Our Website that includes such a Plugin, Your browser connects directly with the servers at Twitter. The content of the Plugin is transferred from Twitter directly to Your browser, which incorporates it into the website. For this reason, We have no influence on the amount of data gathered by Twitter with the aid of this Plugin. We provide this information to the best of Our knowledge, which is that only the IP address of Your connection and the URL of Our Website are transmitted when the Plugin is acquired, but are not used for purposes other than display of the content in the Plugin.</p>
