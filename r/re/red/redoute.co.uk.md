##  How we use this information

####  General Information

We may also use the information you provide to perform a credit search. Before providing credit, lenders such as banks, loan companies and businesses such as La Redoute want to be confident that customers will repay money they lend. To help them do this, they may look at information held by organisations called credit reference agencies. The three main credit reference agencies in the UK are Callcredit, Equifax and Experian. Those agencies hold certain information about most adults in the UK. That information is called your credit reference file or credit report. The agencies get their information from lenders, from information in the public domain (e.g. electoral roll information) and from other sources. Credit reference agencies do not hold credit blacklists and do not tell a lender if it should offer credit - that is for the lender to decide.

  We may perform a credit search in the following circumstances:- 

  * If you apply for a Credit Account;
  * When managing your existing credit facilities.

 

If we perform a credit search, we will search the files of credit reference agencies who record the search whether or not credit is granted. This search may also include people with whom you are "financially linked" or your "associates". You are financially linked or associated with someone if you have applied for or hold joint credit agreements or accounts with that person. The search will be seen by other lenders who use the information to make credit decisions about you. We will use this information along with credit scoring methods to assess your application and to verify your identity. To prevent or detect fraud or to assist in verifying your identity we may also make searches of the records of other companies in the Redcats Group.

  If we enter into a credit agreement with you, we will supply details of that agreement to the credit reference agencies as well as ongoing details of your account and how you manage it. If you do not repay on time or in full we will tell the credit reference agencies who will record details of the debt. All of that information will be seen by other organisations carrying out later searches and may be used by them to make decisions about whether or not to lend to you or those individuals who are financially linked or associated with you. The information may also be used for debt tracing and the prevention of money laundering.

  We, credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies may also use the records for statistical analysis about credit, insurance and fraud. We may pass information to financial and other organisations involved in fraud prevention to protect ourselves and our customers from theft and fraud. If you give us false or inaccurate information and we suspect fraud, we will record this.

  We may use your information held within Redcats Group, including shopping habits, to run your Credit Account if you have one. We may make periodic searches of the records of Redcats Group companies, credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies to manage your account with us, to take decisions regarding credit (including whether to make credit available or to continue or extend existing credit). Those searches will not be available to other lenders for credit assessment purposes. If you require details of the credit reference agencies from whom we obtain and with whom we record information about you please write to us at our Head Office address below or telephone our Customer Care Team on the number given below.
