#### INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE 

_Information Collected Upon Visiting._ When you visit the Applications, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting, the web-pages you visit, the search terms you use, and any advertisements or links on which you click. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider the IP address will be different every time you log on. We use Log Data to monitor the use of the Applications and of our Service, and for the Applications's technical administration. 

_Information Collected Upon Registration._ If you desire to have access to certain restricted sections of the Applications, you will be required to become a registered user, and to submit certain personally identifiable information to Pro Referral. This happens in a number of instances, such as when you sign up for the Pro Referral service, if you desire to receive marketing materials and information, if you submit a Service Request, and/or if you create a Skill Profile to offer services through Pro Referral. Personally identifiable information that we may collect in such instances may include your full name, password, email address, street address, telephone number, mobile phone number for text messages, photographs you upload, and other information that you decide to provide us with, or that you decide to include in your public profile. If you register as a Pro, create a Skill Profile, and/or Quote on a Service Request, we may request and store your credit card number and other personally identifiable information. 

_Business Information._ If you create a Skill Profile, you have the opportunity to provide additional information ("Business Information") such as your business name, logo or avatar, credentials and qualifications, year of business establishment, as well as links to your personal web site, if you have one. You may also upload a photograph portfolio of your previous work. We may supplement or modify the Business Information to conform to our editorial policies or to add information from your website, materials that you supply to us, or publicly available sources. When you respond to a Consumer's Service Request, all of the Business Information is displayed to the Consumer making such Service Request. Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration is entirely optional, but may enable you market your services more effectively and potentially win more jobs on the Applications. 

If you contact us by email through the Applications, we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence, and use such information to respond to your inquiry. 

_Survey._ We may also collect information if you participate in surveys conducted by or on behalf of us or our partner companies, including but not limited to questionnaires, telephone interview and/or discussion groups, and otherwise providing general information about the Pro Referral service.

We reserve the right to use and disclose Anonymous Data to third parties in our discretion.

#### INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE 

We want you to understand when and with whom we may share personal or other information we have collected about you or your activities via our Website or other Applications.

Under no circumstances, other than in the event of a Business Transfer (as discussed below) will Pro Referral sell, rent or lease its Consumer lists (or the Consumer list of any individual Pro) to a third party.

In addition, we share the Quote you submitted on the Service Request and any additional information you choose to provide to the Consumer such as appointment start times, private notes, and questions about the Service Request. If you Quote on a job and your Quote is selected by the Consumer, Pro Referral will then, and only then, share your address, contact phone number, and email address with the Consumer in order to facilitate communication about the scheduled job. 

_To Provide Information to Partner Companies._ We may enter into agreements with one or more partner companies pursuant to which we provide a partner company with a URL and a user registration page co-branded with, or private labeled by, the partner company, and the partner company distributes and promotes the URL to its customers.
