This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting, the web-pages you visit, the search terms you use, and any advertisements or links on which you click. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider the IP address will be different every time you log on. We use Log Data to monitor the use of the Website and of our Service, and for the Website's technical administration.

This happens in a number of instances, such as when you sign up for the Redbeacon service, if you desire to receive marketing materials and information, if you submit a Service Request, and/or if you create a Skill Profile to offer services through Redbeacon. Personally identifiable information that we may collect in such instances may include your full name, password, email address, street address, time zone, telephone number, mobile phone number for text messages, photographs you upload, and other information that you decide to provide us with, or that you decide to include in your public profile.
