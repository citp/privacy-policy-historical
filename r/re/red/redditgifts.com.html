    <h1 class="terms__heading">redditgifts Privacy Policy</h1>

<p class="terms__body-text">Welcome to redditgifts! Our purpose in providing our Services is to provide a gift exchange service with the ability to match gift givers to recipients, and to allow you to shop for gifts on-site. The following Privacy Policy explains how redditgifts ("we," "us," etc.) treats the information you provide while using www.redditgifts.com (the "Site"), the redditgifts Marketplace ("Marketplace"), and all other services we provide (altogether, "Services").</p>

<p class="terms__body-text">Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. You can access it any time at <a href="/privacy/">http://redditgifts.com/privacy/</a>. Your use of and/or registration on any of our Services will constitute your agreement to our Privacy Policy. If you cannot agree with the terms and conditions of our Privacy Policy, please do not use our Services.</p>

<p class="terms__body-text">In addition to reviewing this Privacy Policy, please read our <a href="/terms/">Terms of Service</a>. Your use of our Services constitutes agreement to its terms and conditions as well.</p>

<h2 class="terms__sub-heading">What Information Our Services Collect and Use</h2>
<p class="terms__body-text"><em>How We Collect and Use Your Personally Identifiable Information:</em> We only collect personally identifying information with your specific knowledge and consent, such as when you provide it to us during the signup process. Since the purpose of our Services is to provide an online "Secret-Santa"-style gift exchange ("Gift Exchange") along with our Marketplace, we will ask for personally identifiable information that is relevant to your participation in the Gift Exchange and your transactions in the Marketplace. We will use the information you give us only as described in this Privacy Policy. We will not ask you for any information not necessary to provide the gift-exchange service.</p>

<p class="terms__body-text"><em>How We Use Your Email Address:</em> We will use your email address to send you copies of your username and password, and to communicate updates on the statuses of any Gift Exchange in which you are participating, your Marketplace orders. We may also use it to send you any Service-related communications we think necessary.</p>

￼￼￼￼￼￼
<p class="terms__body-text"><em>Information We Collect When You Participate in a Gift Exchange:</em> When you participate in a Gift Exchange, we collect data like your reddit username, real name, physical mailing address, gender, interests, etc. We need this information to match you with other redditors and to help you send and receive gifts. We won't use this information for any other purpose.</p>

<p class="terms__body-text"><em>Information We Collect When You Use the Marketplace:</em> When you buy gifts on the Marketplace, we will collect your payment information (credit card or other payment method), your name, your email address, and your billing and shipping addresses. The shipping address you provide could be the address of a gift recipient.</p>

<p class="terms__body-text"><em>Log Data:</em> Our servers may also automatically collect information about your computer when you visit our Site, including (but not limited to) the type of browser software you use, the operating system you are running, the website that referred you, and your IP address, which is usually associated with the place from which you enter the Internet, like your Internet Service Provider, your company or your university. We call this all "Log Data."</p>

<p class="terms__body-text">We do not share Log Data with anyone, but we reserve the right to use it internally for any lawful business purpose, including helping us to diagnose problems with our servers, gathering broad demographic information, and otherwise administering our Site. We will not associate Log Data with personally identifiable information.</p>

<h2 class="terms__sub-heading">When We Share or Disclose Your Information.</h2>

<p class="terms__body-text"><em>Information Shared During the Gift-Giving Process:</em> It is your choice whether to disclose any information to a user with whom you are matched during a Gift Exchange. If you choose not to reveal any information (like your name, username, or mailing address) to the person to whom you send a gift, they will not receive any information about you at all.</p>

<p class="terms__body-text"><em>Information We Share with Merchants:</em> You have the option of providing Marketplace merchants with your name and email address when you check out, but you are not required to do so. You may also provide a pseudonym, like your reddit username. We will not otherwise share your information with Marketplace merchants, unless (1) there is a dispute between you and the merchant that is irresolvable without our providing your information, which will be strictly limited to the resolution of your dispute, or (2) we believe — after due consideration — that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with a law or an emergency involving imminent bodily harm or death requires us to disclose it.</p>

<p class="terms__body-text"><em>The Gift Gallery and Other Disclosures You Make:</em> We provide you with the option to post a photograph of gifts you receive, along with notes about those gifts, on the redditgifts Gift Gallery. If you do so, your username will appear alongside the gift, as will any other information you choose to make public. We are not responsible for any of this content, or for the content of any other disclosure of your own information, personal or not, that you choose to make (like in a comment on the Gift Gallery).</p>

<p class="terms__body-text"><em>Information We Share for Informational Purposes:</em> We may use some non- personally identifiable information, like depersonalized geographic data (e.g., the ZIP codes of Gift Exchange participants) to provide information to the Reddit.com community about the geographic distribution of participating redditors. In some cases we may also retain and use your Reddit.com username in association with such informational activities.</p>

<p class="terms__body-text"><em>Third-Party Payment Processing:</em> As explained in our Terms of Service, we used Balanced as a third-party payment processor. When you transmit payment information through the redditgifts Marketplace, you agree to be bound by Balanced's terms and conditions (available at https:// www.balancedpayments.com/terms), along with its privacy policy (available at https://www.balancedpayments.com/privacy).</p>

<p class="terms__body-text"><em>When Laws or Emergencies Require Us to Disclose Information:</em> We may preserve or disclose your information if we believe — after due consideration — that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security, or technical issues; or to protect our rights or property.</p>

<h2 class="terms__sub-heading">Cookies and Analytics</h2>
<p class="terms__body-text"><em>What Are Cookies and How Do We Use Them?</em> We use cookies, small data files that we transfer to your computer to help us remember information about you and keep track of how you use our Services. We may use cookies to record registration and personalization information, and to keep track of analytics data for our Services (via third-party services). For example, if you register on any part of our Site and are given the option to save your user￼name and password on your computer, we can provide this convenience to you by placing a cookie on your computer so that you don't have to enter that information again (unless you clear your cookies).</p>

<p class="terms__body-text"><em>Blocking and Clearing Cookies:</em> If you don't want to allow cookies, your Web browser likely includes an option that allows you to clear your cookies or reject them altogether. However, if you set your browser to refuse cookies, some portions of our Site may not function properly.</p>

<p class="terms__body-text"><em>Third-Party Analytics Services:</em> We also use third-party services like Google Analytics so that we can monitor aggregate usage, traffic information, an other analytics data on our Services. These services may run scripts and place cookies on your machine. They do not receive any personal information about you.</p>

<h2 class="terms__sub-heading">Deleting Your Account</h2>
<p class="terms__body-text">If you decide you would like to delete your account you must email us at support@redditgifts.com.  You must email us from the email address associated with your account and provide your reddit username.</p>

<h2 class="terms__sub-heading">Third-Party Links</h2>
<p class="terms__body-text">Sometimes you will find links to third-party sites on our Services, like on merchants' product or profile pages. If you click those links, you leave our Site and are subject to those third parties' privacy policies and other terms. redditgifts is not responsible for any such third party's activities. We encourage you to read their privacy policies, since they may differ from ours.</p>

<h2 class="terms__sub-heading">Information Security and Notification</h2>
<p class="terms__body-text">Because no data transmission over the Internet is completely secure, and no system of physical or electronic security is impenetrable, we cannot guarantee the security of the information you send to us or the security of our servers or databases. By using our Services, you agree to assume all risk in connection with the information sent to us or collected by us when you use our Services. In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you by email (provided we have your e-mail address).</p>

<h2 class="terms__sub-heading">Minors</h2>
<p class="terms__body-text">Users under the age of 14 are not permitted to use any redditgifts Services.</p>

<h2 class="terms__sub-heading">Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p class="terms__body-text">We reserve the right to change this Policy, and we may do so when our Services change or for any other reason. If we do so, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of material changes by email or by posting a notice on this page.</p>

<h2 class="terms__sub-heading">Contact</h2>
<p class="terms__body-text">If you have any concerns or questions about any aspect of this policy, please feel free to contact our Privacy Policy Coordinator at support@redditgifts.com.</p>
