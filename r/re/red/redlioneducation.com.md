**Privacy Policy**

**Information Collected by RedlionEducation**

**Non-Personally Identifiable Consumer Information**

RedlionEducation collects various types of information from you to better meet your needs and to provide you with a more relevant user experience. Some of this information is collected automatically through cookies (a small text file placed on your computer) or other Internet tracking technologies. The type of information your browser or Internet session may automatically provide us with can include the browser you are using, your Internet domain, the operating system on your computer, your IP address and the URL you saw just before coming to the RedlionEducation site, the pages of the site you visited and the URL of the page you visited upon leaving the site. 

RedlionEducation may also contract with reputable third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may also use cookies or other measures to collect your non-personally identifiable information.

**Sharing Information with Third Parties**

All personally identifiable information you provide is maintained in confidence by RedlionEducation. There are instances, however, in which your personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information is shared with third parties, as described below. 

Your non-personally identifiable data may be shared with third-party partners of RedlionEducation on an anonymous basis. 

When you request information from RedlionEducation or any university affiliated on the website, we may transfer that information within RedlionEducation or route your information to university, across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world, so that they may provide the information on the program that you requested. 

We may also disclose information to a third party who provides substantially similar services as the original service about which you requested more information. In such situations, we will provide you with an opportunity to opt-out of such sharing. Please be aware that RedlionEducation is very careful in selecting companies with whom it does business. 

In addition to the above situations where your information may be shared with others, there is also the possibility that RedlionEducation, or part(s) of the company, may one day be purchased by, or merged with, another company. In the event of such transaction, the acquiring (or merging) company will have access to all collected personally identifiable information. 

Finally, RedlionEducation may share your information as necessary to comply with a court order or to cooperate with government and law enforcement officials.

**Security**

  
Wherever your personally identifiable information may be held within RedlionEducation or on its behalf, we intend to take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the information you shared with us from unauthorized access or disclosure. Please note that while RedlionEducation will make every reasonable effort to protect your information, no transmission of data over the Internet is 100% secure.
