### Information on Public Records

You may be aware that businesses can obtain certain consumer information, such as that related to mortgage loans, which is a matter of public record and available to anyone from the County Recorder’s Office. Unfortunately, this information is often used by companies to market their products and services directly to you. At times, they also make references to the Credit Union or its affiliates, which may imply that they obtained the information from us. The lenders’ names, as well as certain details of the loans are included in the public records, and that is where they obtain their data.

### How to Remove Your Name from Credit Offers

If you prefer not to receive pre-approved credit solicitations, you can write to the credit reporting agencies listed at right, or call **(888) 5OPT-OUT (888-567-8688)**. By removing your name, you will no longer receive unsolicited credit offers from the Credit Union, or other businesses, such as credit card companies, department stores and banks. When you call to remove your name from credit bureau lists, you will be given a choice to opt out for two years, or permanently. Even though your request becomes effective within a week of calling, it may take several months before you see a reduction in the amount of unsolicited offers of credit. 

### How to Reduce "Junk" Mail

The Direct Marketing Association (DMA) sponsors Mail Preference Service (MPS), to help consumers limit the national advertising mail they receive. If you would like to reduce the amount of advertising you receive from companies, you may write a postcard or letter, including your name, home address and signature to: 

Mail Preference Service   
Direct Marketing Association   
PO Box 643   
Carmel, NY 10512-0643 

If you write to this agency, your name will be removed for five years from lists used by direct mail companies that subscribe to MPS. Removing your name will not end all solicitations from businesses that do not subscribe to the service. To eliminate mail from those businesses, as well as mail addressed to "occupant" or "resident," write directly to each source. For more information, visit the DMA Consumer website at www.dmaconsumers.org.
