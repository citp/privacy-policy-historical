RCU Privacy Policy

Privacy Policy Disclosure

Redwood Credit Union (RCU) understands the importance of protecting the privacy of our Members, former Members and customers. We are committed to maintaining the confidentiality of each Member's information consistent with state and federal law. This document is provided to outline RCU's privacy policy and your rights as a Member and customer. 

Part I: What This Policy Covers

This policy covers "non-public personal information," which we call "information" in this policy. This means personally identifiable information that we obtain in the course of providing services to you. This policy does not cover information that is obtained from public sources such as county real estate property records or telephone directories. It does not include information that cannot be identified with you personally, such as general statistical information about our Members or customers. 

Part II: Sources and Categories of Information We Collect

We collect information about you so that we can provide the products and services you request, develop new products and services, inform you about other products and services you may be interested in, and comply with legal and regulatory requirements. Examples of sources and types of information we collect include the following: 

    * From your applications for our services or other communications you have with us, we obtain information such as name, address, Social Security number, assets, income, other debt, and financial transactions. 
    * From our own records, we obtain information about your transactions and account experiences with us, such as account balances, payment history, parties to your transactions, and account credit card use patterns. 
    * From consumer reporting agencies, we obtain information about your financial history with third parties. 
    * From third parties such as employers and other creditors, we verify information that you supply on your applications for our services. 
    * We verify information for third parties involved in transactions on your Credit Union accounts, such as merchants calling to verify checks that you write. 
    * We collect demographic information about our Members to help us develop and provide products and services. 

Part III: Categories of Information We May Disclose About You

We may disclose any type of information we have about you to third parties to meet our reasonable business needs and to conduct your transactions. 

Part IV: Categories of Non-Affiliated Third Parties to Whom We Release Information  
to Conduct Our Business and as Required or Allowed by Law 

We disclose information to non-affiliated third parties as necessary to conduct our business, to conduct your transactions, and as required or allowed by law. Examples include but are not limited to: 

    * Our state and federal regulators 
    * Our attorneys, accountants and other advisors 
    * Consumer reporting agencies 
    * Third parties involved in your Credit Union transactions, such as merchants or other financial institutions 
    * Third parties who make lawful information requests on your account, such as child support data matching programs 

We will disclose any information we have about you to these parties as it is necessary to conduct our business, complete our transactions, or is required or permitted by law. 

Part V: Other Non-Affiliated Third Parties to Whom We Release Information:  
Service Providers and Joint Marketing Partners 

We disclose information to third parties with which we have agreements to help us provide our products or services to you, and to third parties with which we have partnered to jointly offer, endorse or sponsor a financial product or service. We can disclose information we have about you to these third parties, although we generally limit the information we supply to what is necessary for the third parties to fulfill their agreements with us. Before we disclose information to these third parties, they must agree in writing to keep your information confidential and use it only for purposes we authorize. Examples of such third parties include: 

    * Companies with whom we have contracts to print and mail our Member statements 
    * Companies with whom we have contracts to process Member credit card transactions 
    * Companies with whom we have contracts to jointly offer credit insurance

The Credit Union and our wholly owned affiliate, RCU Services Group, may exchange transaction and experience information about you. This includes but is not limited to the fact that you have a customer or Member relationship with us, your account balances, and your transactions with us. 

Part VII: Disclosure of Information Subject to Opt-Out Rights

You have the right to limit the disclosure of non-public personal information with non-affiliated third parties. The limiting of the sharing of this information is known as "opting-out". 

The Credit Union and RCU Services Group may exchange information about you other than transaction or experience information. If you exercise your opt-out rights, we will limit exchange of information about you between the Credit Union and RCU Services Group to transaction and experience information. 

The Credit Union may disclose information about you to third parties, either directly or through our wholly owned affiliate, RCU Services Group, other than as explained in Parts IV and V of this policy. For example, we may disclose any type of information we have about you to: 

    * Financial service providers, such as mortgage bankers, securities broker-dealers, and insurance agencies

You may opt-out by requesting and completing a Privacy Election Form from the Credit Union and mailing it to us at the address given on the form. You may elect to revoke your opt-out at a later date. If you later decide to change your opt-out election, please notify us.

If a new policy will be subject to different opt-out rights, we will give you at least 30 days advance notice before the new policy goes into effect, and we will disclose means by which you can opt- out of disclosure of non-public personal information.
