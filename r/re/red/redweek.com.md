# Privacy Policy | RedWeek

Version 4 (Posted June 29, 2015) / [see version 4 changes](https://web.archive.org/privacy?v=4&diff=1 "click to see changes since last update")

We have created this privacy policy to demonstrate our commitment to the privacy of our users. The following discloses our information gathering and usage practices. 

  1. **Privacy of user information**

We do not sell, rent, or give away user information except in cases where you specifically request it. By purchasing any RedWeek Full Service Product, you agree to allow RedWeek representatives to communicate with your resort (and/or the resort management company) on your behalf, to confirm details of your ownership. 

Occasionally we may run promotions in partnership with third parties where you will be given the option to receive more information. In this case, we will provide your contact information to the third party to follow through on your request. You will never be tricked into signing up for anything. Options to receive more information will always be clearly explained to you and your participation in any promotion is strictly optional. 

If you add a posting to RedWeek.com, your contact information will not be made public, unless you choose to enter additional contact information into the Details section. Otherwise, RedWeek.com members will contact you via the form on your posting page, which will deliver the correspondence to the e-mail address you have provided us with. Your e-mail address will not be exposed to the member who contacted you until you reply. If you send an inquiry through RedWeek.com, the person you contacted will have your e-mail address for further direct correspondence. 

  2. **How your information is used and secured**

The website uses cookies and other client-side technologies to store information on your computer. This allows us to identify you and to analyze your use of the site. Certain information may be shared with third-parties as part of services they provide to us, or as required to do so by law. You are always free to disable these technologies in your browser, but be aware that many website features won’t work correctly without them. 

We currently use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”), for the purpose of analyzing your use of the site. Information about your use (including your IP address) is transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google may, in turn, transfer this information to additional third-parties where required to do so by law, or where such third-parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google does not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. 

By using this website, you consent to the processing of data about you by RedWeek and its service providers. 

We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software to secure the transmission of your credit card information. This software encrypts all information you input and keeps it in a highly secure environment, protected from access by unauthorized parties. It is important for you to protect yourself from unauthorized use of your password by logging off when finished using RedWeek.com. 

  3. **Conditions of contact by RedWeek.com**

As a registered RedWeek.com user, you'll receive our monthly e-mail newsletter and any other subscriptions you request. You may opt out of these non-transactional messages at any time through [Your Account](https://web.archive.org/account/ "View your account") page on RedWeek.com. If you require assistance, you may contact us by e-mail at [support@redweek.com](mailto:support@redweek.com), by phone at 1-866-971-1737; 8 am - 4 pm Pacific Time (Monday - Friday), or by U.S. mail us at P.O.

These transactional e-mails are related to your activity on the site and may not be opted out of. 

  4. **Advertising and third party links**

Some RedWeek.com advertisers and affiliate partners may request information directly from you, or link to sites that do so. We do not endorse or have control over content or policies of third party Web sites.
