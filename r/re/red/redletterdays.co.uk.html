        At Red Letter Days we are committed to protecting your privacy. We use 
the information
    we collect about you to process orders and bookings. Please read on 
for details
    about our privacy policy.

    
        <h3 id="rt-37">
	Controllers of personal information
</h3>
        <p>
	Any personal information provided or to be gathered at redletterdays.co.uk is controlled by Red Letter Days, 77 Muswell Hill, Muswell Hill, London, N10 3PJ.</p>

    
        <h3 id="rt-38">
	What information do we collect? How do we use it?
</h3>
        <p>
	When you order, we need to know your name, address, email address, recipient name and delivery address. This allows us to process and fulfil your order and to notify you of the status of your order.</p>
<p>
	We also ask for your telephone number, which enables us to contact you urgently if there is a problem with your order.</p>
<p>
	To book a date for your experience, we need you know your name, address, email address, answers to any questions required by our experience partners, and a telephone number (preferably mobile) so that we can contact you if there are any last-minute changes to your experience. We will also email you answers to any online booking questions submitted and responses to booking date requests. If you provide us with a mobile phone number, we will send you an SMS reminder the day before you are due to take part in your experience.</p>
<p>
	If you have a web account, you can also access a copy of the booking confirmation letter to print and bring with you on the day. When you create an account, or login at any time after this, you are able to choose whether you wish to receive occasional emails from us about offers, promotions and our latest gift ideas.</p>
<p>
	We send out newsletters only to those that have opted in for this service. Customers are able to opt out at any time – details of how to opt out appear on every newsletter and can usually be found at both the top and bottom of the newsletter.&nbsp; Users will be able to able to opt out either through a dedicated unsubscribe link or through the dedicated preferences area.</p>

    
        <h3 id="rt-39">
	How does Red Letter Days protect customer information?
</h3>
        When you place orders we use a secure server. The secure
    server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it 
is sent to us.
    Furthermore, as required by the UK Data Protection Legislation, we 
follow strict
    security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information you
 have given
    us, to prevent unauthorised access. Our security procedures mean 
that we may occasionally
    request proof of identity before we are able to disclose sensitive 
information to
    you.

    
        <h3 id="rt-41">
	Will Red Letter Days disclose the information it collects to outside parties?
</h3>
        <p>
	Red Letter Days does not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others unless you choose to receive information from trusted third parties when you create or login to your account, in which case you will receive this information until such time as you choose to opt out of receiving these communications.</p>
<p>
	When a customer responds to a promotion offered in conjunction with a third party, that third party may, from time to time, collect information about those customers. They will only then be contacted if they have opted-in to receive further information.</p>
<p>
	Red Letter Days may capture and provide aggregate statistics about our customer behaviour, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.</p>
<p>
	Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mails, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analysing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments and providing customer services. Such companies and individuals will have access to personal information needed to perform these functions, but may not use it for any other purposes and are required to process the data in accordance with the UK's Data Protection legislation.</p>

    
        <h3 id="rt-42">
	Red Letter Days Customer Review Policy
</h3>
        <p>
    Customers who submit reviews to us via our feedback page must 
confirm that they
    have written their reviews based on their own opinions and 
experiences and that
    the information contained in their reviews are factual.</p>
<p>
    Any material considered inappropriate or offensive will not be 
published or will
    be amended.</p>
<p>
    By submitting a review, customers grant us permission to publish it 
online or via
    print media and, if necessary, edit it for clarity and typos.</p>
<p>
    We never publish a reviewer’s name in full (Christian name and 
surname initial only).</p>
    
        <h3 id="rt-43">
