    computer's IP Address . When a visitor requests a page 
    from any Web site within the Numus Software Network, our Web servers automatically 
    recognize that visitor's domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP 
    address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address from

    traffic in aggregate, and to investigate misuse of the Numus Software Network, its

    Internet browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. 
    A cookie can't read data off of your computer hard disk or read cookie files 
    created by other Web sites. Cookies do not damage your system. We use 
    cookies to identify which areas of the Numus Software Network you have visited or 
    customized, so the next time you visit, those pages may be readily 
    accessible. Our advertisers may also use cookies to ascertain how many times 
    you've seen an advertisement. Our advertisers and we may use this

    you see on our site. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing

    may use single-pixel gif images, sometimes referred to as web bugs or web 
    beacons, to count Web page accesses and gather some general statistical 
    information. RECOVERY-CD.COM does not gather personal information through the use of

    clients. Our clients may send you promotional material that is related to 
    the topic of the service for which you registered. We may also use your IP

    newsletters, announcement lists or information about conferences and trade 
    shows). Whenever we request the identity of a visitor, we will clearly 
    indicate the purpose of the inquiry before the information is requested. We 
    maintain a strict "No-Spam" policy that means that we do not sell, rent, or 
    otherwise give your e-mail address to a third-party, without your consent or

    above, RECOVERY-CD.COM will not send you e-mail that you have not agreed to receive. If 
    you choose to supply your postal address in an online form, you may receive

    RECOVERY-CD.COM discussion forum, your name or alias is recorded solely for purposes of 
    maintaining your own account within the forums. This information is not used 
    to monitor your activity within a forum, nor is it used to identify you 
    outside the Numus Software Network. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000000">When you register for a

    fulfil your order and to notify you of your order status. This information 
    may also be used by us to notify you of related products and services. 
    Credit card and e-mail information will not be shared or sold to third

    your express permission. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000000">Certain RECOVERY-CD.COM media 
    properties use a shopping cart feature that safeguards this information by 
    using industry standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encrypted servers. SSL 
    codes the information transferred between you and the server, rendering it 
    unreadable to anyone trying to intercept the information. Other RECOVERY-CD.COM media 
    properties do not use SSL and thereby do not offer a secure coded way to 
    transfer information. </span></p>
