We will not sell or rent your information to other marketers. Your personal information will only be disclosed to a third party (other than as described herein) upon a merger or reorganization between us and such a third party or as needed to provide technical support or development for the website or application, or as required to process subscription payment transactions.

### Cookies and Log Data

For general visitors to our websites, we use “cookies” and other tools to collect information about users’ visits, such as which pages of the site are visited and for how long. A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive.

Cookies are required to use all ATSI services. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you will not be able to use portions of our Service and website.

In addition, we may use third party services such as Google Analytics that collect, monitor and analyze this type of information in order to increase our Service’s functionality. We take responsibility in validating controls and compliance of any and all third party subprocessors of this information.

### Disclosure and Legal Compliance

We will disclose your Personal Information where required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement or to protect the security or integrity of our Service.

Our websites will occasionally have links to other websites that are not operated by ATSI. We are not responsible for the contents of those websites and have no control over what information they may or may not collect from you.

### Data Storage

ATSI uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run ATSI services. Although ATSI owns the code, databases, and all rights to the ATSI suite of applications, you retain all rights to your data.

We may transfer your personal information to our service providers and others located in the United States or elsewhere in the world for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
