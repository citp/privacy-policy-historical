                  <div>
                  <p>If you shorten Digital Stores URLs, for example on Twitter or Facebook, and use the SmartURL service to do so, Digital Stores works with SmartURL to rebrand some links e.g. a http://kyl.ie/xxxxx link. Digital Stores web products or phone apps sometimes offer features that allow users to share links with social networks and Digital Stores shortens that URL using the SmartURL service. Also Digital Stores shortens links to online stores like the iTunes Music Store using the SmartURL service. SmartURL provides Digital Stores with anonymised, aggregated statistics relating to use of a shortened Digital Stores URL, for example by telling us how many times it has been clicked on. Digital Stores does not have access to the IP address of your computer collected by SmartURL when you use its service or any other identifiable information about you. Nor does SmartURL have any access to data collected on an Digital Stores website. For more information see <a href="http://manage.smarturl.it/mng/privacy">SmartURL's privacy policy</a>.</p>
