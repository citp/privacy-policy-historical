            <p>When visitors elect to become members of Recipe4Living.com, we 
              request that they provide additional, personally-identifiable information. 
              This includes name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, age 
              bracket, day and month of birth. All registrants may receive e-mail 
              confirming their registration, and subsequent correspondence. If 
              you do not want to receive e-mail from us in the future, please 
              let us know by using the unsubscribe option on the bottom of every 
              email. Certain information, such as your e-mail address, is collected 
              in order to, among other functions, verify your identity in the 
              future within our database. When you select to receive information 
              about offerings from a third party company during the registration 
              process, we will share your personal information with that third 
              party company to carry out your information request. Recipe4Living.com 
              may also use such information to directly market certain offers 
              to you (via e-mail, direct mail and/or telemarketing), to monitor 
              compliance with our Terms and Conditions and for content improvement 
              and feedback purposes. We may sell the personal information that 
              you supply to us and we may join together with other businesses 
              to bring selected retail opportunities to our members. These businesses 
              may include, but are not limited to: (a) providers of direct marketing 
              services and applications, including lookup and reference, data 
              enhancement, suppression and validation; (b) e-mail marketers; and 
              (c) telemarketers. </p>
            <p>We may also employ other companies and individuals to perform certain 
              functions on our behalf. Examples include sending direct and electronic 
              mail, removing duplicate information from customer lists, analyzing 
              data, and providing marketing analysis. These agents have access 
              to our members’ personal information as needed to perform 
              their functions for Recipe4Living.com, but we do not permit them 
              to use our members’ personal information for other purposes.</p>
            <p>Recipe4Living.com reserves the right to release current or past 
              member information in the event Recipe4Living.com believes that 
              the membership is being or has been used in violation of the Website’s 
              terms and conditions, or to commit unlawful acts, if the information 
              is subpoenaed, if Recipe4Living.com is sold or acquired, or when 
              Recipe4Living.com deems it necessary or appropriate. By agreeing 
              to these conditions, you hereby consent to disclosure of any record 
              or communication to any third party, when Recipe4Living.com, in 
              its sole discretion, determines the disclosure to be appropriate 
              including, without limitation, sharing your e-mail address with 
              other third-parties for suppression purposes in compliance with 
              the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, as amended from time to time, and Federal 
              Trade Commission enabling regulations.</p>
            <p>In addition, by registering at the Website, you agree that such 
              act constitutes an inquiry and/or application for purposes of the 
              Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule (16 CFR §310 et seq.), as 
              amended from time to time (the “Rule”). Notwithstanding 
              that your telephone number may be listed at the Federal Trade Commission’s 
              Do-Not-Call List, we retain the right to contact you via telemarketing 
              in accordance with the Rule.</p>
            <p>From time to time, we may receive personal information about you 
              from outside sources and add it to your existing registration information 
              on file at the Website. We do this to improve personalization of 
              our services (for example, providing better newsletter content, 
              advertising and/or special offers that we think may be of interest 
              you).</p>
            <p>We may also collect other information such as your IP address, 
              domain names, access times and referring third party website addresses. 
              This information is used by Recipe4Living.com for the operation 
              of the Website, to maintain the quality of our offerings, and to 
              provide general aggregate statistics regarding Recipe4Living.com. 
              Such information is not personally identifiable. </p>
            <p>We also collect information such as the identification of the server 
              that your computer is logged onto and whether you opened a Recipe4Living.com 
              e-mail message delivered to you. We also may compare our member 
              list to various lists received from other third party companies, 
              in an effort to avoid sending identical or similar e-mail messages 
              to our members.</p>
            <p>When you obtain any product or service directly from Recipe4Living.com, 
              we collect certain financial information, such as your credit card 
              number, credit card expiration date and billing address. Financial 
              Information that you disclose to Recipe4Living.com is used to 
              confirm your age and to bill you for shipping our products and services. 
              To the extent that customer credit card-specific information is 
              collected by Recipe4Living.com, said information will be kept 
              in confidence and will not be shared with any third parties (other 
              than consumer credit agencies) without your prior informed consent. 
              Notwithstanding the foregoing, Recipe4Living.com reserves the 
              right to share with third parties the fact that we have credit card 
              information on file for specific customers but we will not share 
              the specific credit card information with third parties without 
              your prior informed consent. </p>
            <p><strong>Information Collection Processes</strong><br>
              Recipe4Living.com may employ "cookies" to help customize 
              your access to the Website. A cookie is a piece of data stored on 
              a your hard drive containing information about you. Cookies have 
              many benefits to enhance your experience at our Website. For instance, 
              by setting a cookie on our Website, a member would not have to log 
              in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our Website. 
              Even in the case where a member rejects a cookie, they may still 
              use our Website. The only drawback to this is that the member will 
              be limited in what he/she can access in some areas on our Website, 
              much like visitor-level access. </p>
            <p>We occasionally use cookies to anonymously track and target the 
              interests of our members to further enhance the experience on our 
              Website or for advertising tracking purposes. To find out more about 
              cookies, please visit <a href="http://www.cookiecentral.com/">www.cookiecentral.com</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>In addition to cookies, our Website pages and/or e-mails may contain 
              electronic images known as “pixel tags” (also knows 
              as clear gifs) to track the pages that visitors and/or members visit 
              at the Website for purposes of formatting future campaigns and upgrading 
              visitor information used in reporting statistics. </p>
            <p>Our Website may also contain pixel tags placed there by third parties 
              to help determine the effectiveness of a joint promotional or advertising 
              campaign. </p>
            <p><strong>Security</strong> <br>
              Recipe4Living.com has security measures in place to protect the
