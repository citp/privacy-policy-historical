recipe. 
</p>
<p class="privacy">

<b>Ordering from RecipeLand.com</b>
<br>
RecipeLand and our e-commerce partners such as PayPal 
are committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. When ordering 
products from one of our partner sites, information about you is requested 
on an order form. The information that is collected from you is used to 
process orders and provide a more personalized shopping experience. RecipeLand.com 
does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. 
</p><p class="privacy">
To find out more detailed information regarding our commerce partner's 
privacy policies, please click on the links provided below:

<br>
</p>
				
<p class="privacy">
<b>Security &amp; Safety</b><br>
				
To take the worry out of using your credit card to order through the web, PayPal
 use a Secure Server Technology (SSL), which encrypts 
your information so that it cannot be read as it travels over the 
Internet. Which means - the characters are scrambled, making it impossible for 
a third party to intercept your personal information.
</p><p class="privacy">
	You can verify that the encryption is working by locating the lock icon at the 
bottom of the web page. While on a secure page, the lock icon on the bottom of 
Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes 
locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, as when you are just 'surfing.' All 
pages within the Marketplace will show the locked icon on the bottom of each 
page. To learn more about SSL, follow this link to an encryption software 
authenticator: www.versign.com. 
</p>

<p class="privacy">
<b>Cookies</b>
<br>
Like most web sites, we use "cookie" technology on our web site. 
We may place a "cookie" in the browser file of your computer, however 
the "cookie" itself does not contain any personally identifying 
information about you. The "cookie" does not track your personal 
information or provide us with any way to contact you, and the 
"cookie" does not extract any information off your computer. We
use the "cookie" to provide functional information about your 
browser, allowing us to provide you a better experience. We also 
use "cookies" to gather broad demographic information and general 
usage patterns about you and other users of our sites.  
</p>
<p class="privacy">
If your browser rejects cookies, you may still use our site.  The 
only drawback to this is that you will be limited from accessing 
certain areas of our site, such as contests, coupons, MyRecipes Box, 
shopping list feature, etc. 
</p>
<p class="privacy">
<b>Third Party Advertising</b>
<br>
We use Burst Media and other third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you 
visit our Web site.  These companies may use information (not including your name, 
address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web 
sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods 
and services that might be of interest to you.  If you would like more information 
about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used 
by these companies, <a href="http://www.burstmedia.com/release/privacy.asp" class="weblink">click here</a>. 
				
</p><p class="privacy">
<b>Third Party Cookies</b>
<br>
In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may 
place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.
</p>
<p class="privacy">
<b>Log Files</b>

<br> 
Each time a RecipeLand.com page is requested from your browser, we log your 
computer's IP address into our log files. Your computer has been pre-assigned 
a 12-digit number. This number is the IP address. We use your IP addresses to 
analyze trends, administer the site, track your movements on the site, and 
gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not 
linked to any other personally identifiable information by RecipeLand.com. 
RecipeLand.com does not control or monitor whether third parties with web 
beacons on the RecipeLand.com Web site have the same policy.
</p>
<p class="privacy">
<b>Other Sites</b>

<br>
From time to time we may have links to other websites from our site.  
We do not control, and therefore cannot be responsible for, the collection, 
use or disclosure of your information by any such third party site.  Please 
carefully review the privacy policy of any third party site that you link to 
from our site.
</p>
<p class="privacy">
<b>Security</b>

<br>
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use 
of your information, RecipeLand.com has put into place physical, electronic, and 
managerial procedures to help safeguard and secure the information we collect 
online.  We use industry standard security measures called SSL (secure socket layer)
