By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that you voluntarily submit to participate in the website activity. We are not responsible for and have no control over these third parties’ use of this information. However, we will notify you at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if these third parties will obtain such information. 

We may use third parties to present or serve the advertisements that you may see on the website. This privacy policy does not cover any use of the data that a third party ad server may have collected from you.

#### URL Shortening

If you shorten Universal Music Direct Limited URLs, for example on Twitter or Facebook, and use the [smartURL](https://manage.smarturl.it/mng/learn) service to do so, Universal Music Direct Limited works with smartURL to rebrand some links, e.g. a <http://kyl.ie/xxxx> link. Universal Music Direct Limited web products or phone apps sometimes offer features that allow users to share links with social networks and Universal Music Direct Limited shortens that URL using the smartURL service. Also Universal Music Direct Limited shortens links to online stores like the iTunes Music Store using the smartURL service.

smartURL provides Universal Music Direct Limited with anonymised, aggregated statistics relating to use of a shortened Universal Music Direct Limited URL, for example by telling us how many times it has been clicked on. Universal Music Direct Limited does not have access to the IP address of your computer collected by smartURL when you use its service or any other identifiable information about you. Nor does smartURL have any access to data collected on a Universal Music Direct Limited website.

For more information about smartURL see [smartUrl’s Privacy Policy](https://manage.smarturl.it/mng/privacy).

Please note that third parties (including, for example, advertising networks and providers of external services like web traffic analysis services) may also use cookies, over which we have no control. These cookies are likely to be analytical/performance cookies or targeting cookies.

We may use cookies:

  * to collect anonymised data on users behaviour on the site. We may also capture what site a user has come from and what site they go to and also some demographic data (e.g. the user’s location) and we may use that data to analyse user behaviour across multiple sites; 
  * to categorise pools of users (on an anonymised basis) based on demographic and/or behavioural data and use this to (1) target our advertising to cookie-ed users on third party sites and Universal Music sites (2) use that data to allow targeted third party advertising to categorised cookie-ed users either in respect of advertising placement UMG has bought/placed and targeted to users on behalf of third parties or in respect of advertising bought/placed by third parties and targeted to cookie pools UMG has “sold” to these third parties.



We may use Google AdSense to publish ads on this site. When you view or click on an ad a cookie will be set to help better provide advertisements that may be of interest to you on this and other Web sites. You may opt-out of the use of this cookie by visiting [Google’s Advertising and Privacy page](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).

If you want to delete or disable any cookies (or similar technologies), please refer to the instructions of your file management software to locate the file and directory that stores cookies.

If you do not consent to the use of the cookies (or similar technologies) at any time, please see above on how to disable cookies.

### Web Beacons

We, or our third party partners, may employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that helps us understand what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to let us know when content is viewed. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages. We may tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.

### Log Files

As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include, for example, internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn how users move around and user the site. We may link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.

### Local Storage

We may use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LSOs in, for example, HTML5 or Flash to collect and store information. 

Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. To manage Flash LSOs please see Abobe’s [Flash Player Help page](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html).
