Recruitics, LLC, and its subsidiary Recruitics UK, LTD ( **“Recruitics”** , **“we”** , **“our”** , and **“us”** ) offers the world’s most advanced analytics platform for managing and optimizing a business recruitment marketing strategy. Recruitics is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy ( **“Policy”** ) explains our privacy practices regarding the information that we collect, use, share, and secure from users on [https://action.recruitics.com](https://action.recruitics.com/) and [https://analytics.recruitics.com](https://analytics.recruitics.com/), (each, a **“Site”** and collectively, the **"Sites"** ), our technology platform (the **“Platform”** ), our services ( **“Services”** ) and any information collected from those who use our Platform and Services (our **“Clients”** ).

##### 1\. INFORMATION WE COLLECT

We collect information, including personal information, in various ways when you use our Sites, and Services and when Clients leverage the Platform on their respective websites. As used in this Policy, “personal information” means any information which, either alone or in combination with other information, identifies you as an individual, such as your name, mailing address, and email address. 

**Information Collected via our Sites and from Clients**

We do not require personal information in order to visit our Sites. However, you may choose to provide us with personal information. For example, you may send us an email in order to ask a question. We use the information provided to answer your question or address your concern. Similarly, when you register as a Client, and at other times, you may submit basic information such as your company name, email address, phone number and physical address and create a user ID and password. We also collect PII in connection with surveys we conduct with Clients and prospective Clients. We will use that information to provide the Services, to run the survey, to provide you access to the Platform and to manage and maintain your Client account. In connection with using our Sites, Platform and Services, from time-to-time, you may provide us with job openings, job ads, and/or performance media targets (e.g., cost per click) that you are willing to pay. We use this information in order to manage Client accounts and to better serve our Clients. 

We also collect non-personally identifiable Information from visitors to the Sites. Non-personally identifiable Information is information that cannot by itself be used to identify a particular person or entity, and may include your IP host address, pages viewed, browser type, Internet browsing and usage habits, Internet Service Provider, domain name, the time/date of your visit to the Sites, the referring URL and your computer’s operating system.

_Cookies and other Tracking Technologies_. We use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the Sites and track users’ movements around the Sites. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. For more information about cookies, please visit <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/cookies/>.

**Information Collected Via our Technology Platform**

Clients generally embed our technology Platform into their websites as an analytics plug-in that collects certain data that such Clients use to inform their employee recruitment strategy. We automatically collect certain information via the Platform pursuant to providing the Services:

  * When you visit our Sites or the website of one of our Clients who have enabled the Platform, some information is automatically collected during your visit. This may include information such as the Operating System (O/S) running on your device, Internet Protocol (IP) address (which may be used to obtain your geolocation such as your zip code or city), access times, browser type, language, and the website you visited prior to your visit to our Sites and/or Client websites. We also collect information about how you use our Sites and our Clients’ sites pursuant to providing the Services, including the site elements you have interacted with, metadata, and other details about these elements, clicks, change states, and other user actions. The type of information collected by our platform is not considered personal information in most jurisdictions.
  * _Cookies_. Our Platform automatically collects information using "cookies" or similar technologies pursuant to providing the Services. Among other things, such technologies help us improve our Sites, our marketing activities, and your experience. We use cookies to count visits to our Sites and Client websites. Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can choose to set your browser to remove, reject or otherwise restrict cookies.



The Platform is not intended to collect personal information such as name, postal address, or telephone number. Similarly, the Platform is not intended to collect sensitive personal information such as payment card information, social security numbers or personal information contained on a job application. If this type of information were discovered on the Platform, we would take reasonable steps to remove it from the Platform. 

##### 2\. HOW WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT

_Creation of anonymous data_. We may create anonymous, non-identifiable, sanitized, and/or aggregated data records from personal information by excluding information (such as applicant name) that makes it commercially impractical to use the data to identify said applicant. We use this anonymous data to analyze request and usage patterns so that we may enhance the content of our Services and improve the Platform and Sites. We reserve the right to use anonymous data for any purpose and disclose or sell anonymous data to third parties in our sole discretion.

##### 3\. HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION WE COLLECT

We do not share your personal information with third parties without your consent other than:

  * _Third Party Service Providers_. With third party agents and service providers (e.g., email marketing providers, database vendors and survey vendors) who work on our behalf and use data only as directed by us, provided that such third parties subscribe to the Principles or provide at least the same level of privacy protection as required by the Principles;
  * _Lawful Requests_. To comply with laws or to respond to lawful requests and legal process (provided that Recruitics will endeavor to notify you if Recruitics has received a lawful request for your information). Note that we may be required to provide personal information in response to lawful requests from public authorities including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.;
  * _Protection of Rights and Property_. To protect the rights and property of Recruitics, our agents, customers and others including to enforce our agreements, policies and our terms of service.

In the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, personal information may also be transferred as a business asset. If another company acquires our company, business or assets, that company will possess the personal information collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your personal information as described in this Policy.



We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our Services. Recruitics is potentially liable for the onward transfer to third parties of personal information of EU and Swiss individuals pursuant to the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield programs, respectively.

##### 4\. HOW WE PROTECT INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT

However, no transmission over the internet is 100% secure. It is your responsibility to protect your usernames and passwords to help prevent anyone from accessing or abusing your accounts and services. You should not use or reuse the same passwords you use with other accounts as your password for our Services.

##### 5\. CHILDREN

We do not intentionally gather personal information from visitors who are under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, you are not permitted to submit any personal information to us. If we learn that a child under 13 submits personal information to Recruitics we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible.
