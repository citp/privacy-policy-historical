By using the Services and/or providing us with information, you (a) consent to the transfer and/or processing of any information to and in the United States, (b) acknowledge that U.S. law may provide a lower standard of protection for information than the laws of your location, (c) understand that we will collect, transfer, store, process and share your information from or about you in accordance with this Notice and U.S. law.

  2. **TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM OR ABOUT YOU**



When you interact with the Services, we collect information that directly identifies you ( _i.e._ , information that would allow someone to identify you or contact you, such as your full name, postal address, e-mail address, or telephone number), as well as information about your use of the Services.  Below we describe the different types of information we collect from you and the devices you use when you interact with the Services.

**_Information you provide to us:_   **Some of the Services may permit you to enter contact information and other information about yourself and others.  We collect and store any information you enter through the Services.  For example, you may provide:

  * your name, postal address, e-mail address, phone number, profile picture, birthday, or other information, such as when you register with our Services, create or edit your user profile, sign up to receive newsletters, or enter in a contest or sweepstakes;
  * certain demographic information, such as your age, gender, or income bracket, when you participate in a survey or poll;

  * your first and last name, your address, and your credit card and billing information if you purchase of a product at the Discovery Store or subscribe to one of Discovery’s paid Services; or

**_Information we collect automatically from your devices:_**   When you interact with the Services, certain information about your use of the Services is automatically collected.  This information includes information about the devices used to access the Services, such as Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, your device ID and other unique device identifiers, mobile network information, information about how the device is interacting with our Services, hardware model, and the type and version of your device’s operating system or web browser.  We also collect information about how you use our Services, such as pages viewed and the order of such pages, content (including video content) or advertising you view within the Services; the length of time you interact with the Services; search queries entered within the Services; error logs; websites and other services you visit before and after visiting a Discovery site; and other similar information.  Much of this information is collected through cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies.  Please see our [Tracking Technologies Notice](https://corporate.discovery.com/tracking-technologies-notice/) for further information, including your choices in relation to the use of these technologies.

**_Information from Social Media Networks and Other Third Parties:_** When you use certain features of the Services, you may give us permission to access information about you from services offered by third parties, including social media networks.  For example, you may choose to register on our websites by using a social media account, or you may use a social media function on our Services such as a “share” button.  Doing that allows us to obtain information from the social media platform.  That information could include your friends or contacts, profile picture, birth date, gender, people/sites you follow, or other profile-related information, as well as any other information you have opted to share. The information we obtain from social media networks depends on your account/privacy settings with those third parties and those third-parties’ privacy policies, so be sure to check those policies and to adjust your settings to meet your preferences.

We may also obtain information about you from other third-party sources, such as our partners and advertisers, interactive applications offered through our services (such as embedded video players), and commercially available sources such as data aggregators and public databases.  We may combine the information we receive from third parties with information we collect through the Services.

**_Location Information_** : We collect general information about your location through the Services, such as the city, state, and/or zip code associated with your IP Address.  If you agree, we may collect more specific location information that is provided through the GPS functionality on your mobile device used to access the Services. That location information is used to present information and advertising that is of relevance to you in your geographic area and to allow you to take advantage of certain features of the Services such as tailoring live class schedules to your time zone or providing you with local grocery store options for recipe ingredient delivery.  If you grant permission for us to collect more specific GPS location information, you can disable such access through your mobile device settings.

**_Information You Provide About Others_ :** If you send someone else a communication using the Services, such as sending content to a friend, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, etc.) is used to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise in accordance with applicable legal requirements.  Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on our Services, your e-mail address may be included in the communication you send.

You have many choices regarding how we use and share your information.  These choices are described in more detail below.

We will respond to your request and, if applicable and appropriate, make the requested change in our active databases as soon as reasonably practicable.  Please note:

  7. **ADDITIONAL PRIVACY INFORMATION FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS**



If you are a California resident, California law requires us to provide you with some additional information regarding the “personal information” (as defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”)) we collect from and about you, and your rights with respect to your personal information.  You can find this additional information in our California Privacy Notice .

  8. **ADDITIONAL PRIVACY INFORMATION FOR NEVADA RESIDENTS**



Under Nevada law, Nevada residents who have purchased goods or services from us may opt out of the “sale” of “covered information” (as such terms are defined under Nevada law) for monetary consideration to a person for that person to license or sell such information to additional persons.  In some circumstances, we may share your information with certain third parties that we believe can provide you with offers and promotions for products and services of interest to you.  This sharing may qualify as a sale under Nevada law. If you are a Nevada resident who has purchased goods or services from us, you may submit a request to opt out of “sales” activity emailing us at [privacy_policy@discovery.com](mailto:privacy_policy@discovery.com).   Please note we may take reasonable steps to verify your identity and the authenticity of the request.

Discovery Services are generally directed to adults and not intended for use by children under the age of thirteen (13), we do not allow children to provide their “personal information” (as defined by the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act or “COPPA”) on these Services, and we will delete such information in a reasonable period of time if we become aware of it.  In some limited cases, Discovery does offer Services that are intended for use by children under thirteen (13); please see the privacy notices posted on those services for more information.  If you have any questions about our practices with respect to children’s privacy or to request that we delete personal information provided by your child, please contact us at [privacy_policy@discovery.com](mailto:privacy_policy@discovery.com).

  10. **HOW WE MAINTAIN AND SECURE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT**



We maintain the information we collect for as long as necessary to provide the Services, for so as long as reasonably required to satisfy the purpose for which you submitted the information or our business purposes, or as required by law.

We take technical and organizational security measures to protect your information against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access. However, no method of transmission over the internet, and no means of electronic or physical storage, is absolutely secure. As such, you acknowledge and accept that we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted to, through, or on our Services or via the Internet and that any such transmission is at your own risk.

If you create an account or register with any of our Services, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your password at all times.

Our Services may contain links to third-party websites (e.g., online stores that offer products for purchase), third-party plug-ins (e.g., social-sharing buttons), and third-party features (e.g., banner advertisements).  These third-party services may collect information from or about you when you interact with them, and in some cases, they may track your activity, including through the use of cookies or other tracking technologies, without you needing to interact with them. We are not responsible for the content or practices of such third parties, and their collection, use, and disclosure of your information will be subject to their privacy policies, and not this Notice. We urge you to read the privacy and security policies of these third parties.

**12.GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE**

This Notice and all disputes arising hereunder or relating hereto shall be governed by, and will be construed under, the laws of the State of New York, without regard to choice of law principles.  Those who choose to access the Services from locations outside the United States do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws if and to the extent local laws are applicable.  By using the Services, you agree that the exclusive jurisdiction for any dispute not subject to any applicable arbitration clause in our Terms of Use or Visitor Agreement shall be the state and federal courts located in New York.

  13. **UPDATES TO THE NOTICE**



We may change this Notice from time to time as our services, technology, and legal obligations change.  If we make changes, we will post the updated Notice and revise the “Last Updated” date.  Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting of the revised Notice, and your continued use of the Services after that date will indicate your consent to any changes, unless applicable law requires us to provide another form of notice and/or seek your agreement to such changes.

  1. **California Information & Deletion Rights **



If you are a California resident, the CCPA allows you to make certain requests about your personal information. Specifically, the CCPA allows you to request us to:

  * Inform you about the categories of personal information we collect or disclose about you; the categories of sources of such information, the business or commercial purpose for collecting your personal information, and the categories of third parties with whom we share/disclose personal information;
  * Provide access to and/or a copy of certain personal information we hold about you;
  * Delete certain personal information we have about you; and
  * Provide you with information about the financial incentives that we offer to you, if any.



Please note that certain information may be exempt from such requests under California law.  For example, we need certain information in order to provide the Services to you.

Verification: We will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before responding to a request, which may include, at a minimum, depending on the sensitivity of the information you are requesting and the type of request you are making, verifying your name, e-mail address, and physical address.

You are also permitted to designate an authorized agent to submit certain requests on your behalf.  In order for an authorized agent to be verified, you must provide the authorized agent with signed, written permission to make such requests or a power of attorney.  We may also follow up with you to verify your identity before processing the authorized agent’s request.

If you would like further information regarding your legal rights under California law or would like to exercise any of them, please submit your request using the following intake form:

[**_California Information & Deletion Requests_**](https://corporate.discovery.com/california_accessdeletion)

If you prefer, you may contact us at the following toll-free phone number to make your request: +1-866-324-3637.

  1. **Notice of Right to Opt-Out of Sale of Personal Information**



California residents may opt out of the “sale” of their personal information.  Under the CCPA, “sale” is broadly defined to mean the sharing of personal information with third parties who are not acting as our service providers or who are otherwise not restricted from using data only on our behalf or pursuant to an applicable CCPA exception.

In some circumstances, we may share certain of your information with third parties to provide you with offers, promotions, and opportunities that may be of interest to you, which may be considered a “sale” under the CCPA.  Under the CCPA, “sale” may also include allowing third parties to “collect” certain information, such as IP address, and/or browsing behavior, through cookies and similar technologies, to deliver targeted advertising on the Services or other services.  Advertising, including targeted advertising, enables us to provide you certain content for free and allows us to provide you offers relevant to you.

If you would like to opt out of our use of your information for such purposes that are considered a “sale” under California law, you may do so as outlined on the following page:  [_Do Not Sell My Personal Information_](https://corporate.discovery.com/california_dns).  Please note that we do not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age without legally-required affirmative authorization.

The CCPA further provides you with the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising your access, deletion or sale opt out rights.

  1. **California “Shine the Light” Disclosure**



If a company shares “personal information” (as defined in California’s “Shine the Light” law, Civil Code § 1798.83) with third parties for their direct marketing purposes (e.g., to send offers and information that may be of interest to you), California law requires either providing a mechanism by which consumers can obtain more information about such sharing over the prior calendar year, or providing a mechanism by which consumers can opt out of such sharing.  As discussed above, we provide an opt out for this sharing.  If you are a California resident and would like to opt out of sharing pursuant to this law, please use the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” link above.
