            reComparison encourages you to review the privacy statements of Web sites you choose to link to from reComparison so that you can understand how those Web sites collect, use and share your information. reComparison is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on Web sites outside of the reComparison and reComparison family of Web sites.

            reComparison collects and uses your personal information to operate the reComparison Web site and deliver the services you have requested. reComparison also uses your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from reComparison and its affiliates. reComparison may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.
            </p><p>
            reComparison does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. reComparison may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. In addition, reComparison may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to reComparison, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.
            </p><p>

            reComparison does not use or disclose sensitive personal information, such as race, religion, or political affiliations, without your explicit consent.

            <p></p><p>    
            The reComparison Web site use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
            </p><p>
            One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize reComparison pages, or register with reComparison site or services, a cookie helps reComparison to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same reComparison Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the reComparison features that you customized.
            </p><p>

            You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the reComparison services or Web sites you visit.
            </p><p>
            </p><div class="subHeader">Security </div>
            <p></p><p>
            reComparison secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. reComparison secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
            </p><p>
            </p><div class="subHeader">Changes to this Privacy Statement</div>                             
            <p></p><p>
            reComparison will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect company and customer feedback. reComparison encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how reComparison is protecting your information.
