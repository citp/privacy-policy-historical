# Recorded Future

Recorded Future User Privacy Policy v1.74 – Effective June 14, 2010 

## What We May Collect About You

When you visit the Recorded Future website, or use our services, we may collect the following types of information: 

### Information About People or Entities Online.

The purpose of Recorded Future’s services is to amass data from thousands of selected sources at high pace and extract information from that data. Thus, from publicly available data, including commercially available data, we correlate different data sources to extract meaningful information from the raw data. This includes information about individual companies, people, organizations, places, etc. - as well as events in which they are involved. By analyzing dates referenced in that public information, we can also add temporal information about subjects and events – not only what events are happening, but when they are happening and who are the participants. We honor robots.txt and behave as a responsible crawler. The raw and analyzed data is stored in a centrally located and secured location. We harvest publicly accessible data to build an awesome user experience and an API that our users can benefit from in doing all kinds of information, analysis, and search tasks. We currently offer multiple kinds of capabilities - and expect to build many other types of services in the future. 

While the underlying documents that we process during harvesting are not stored beyond a brief caching period, the indexes and other data that we generate in our harvesting process will be stored for a long time in order to enhance the quality of the services offered. The information collected is limited only by the nature of the information publicly posted online or commercially available, in government filings (e.g. SEC filings) or in publicly accessible locations. This means that much of the information will relate to high profile people, companies or events (e.g., the President of the United States, CEO of General Electric, etc.), but it can include information about just about anyone – if that information is in a public source. If you want to know what information the Recorded Future index contains about you from public sources, simply query the user interface, but remember that not every potential source on the internet is indexed (actually, far from it). If you find an error, or want us to add a new source, enter a note of correction in our user interface and we will respond to your request as appropriate. 

### Information You Provide to Us.

When you sign up as a customer, you may be asked to provide certain information about yourself, including personally identifiable information, (name, address, e-mail address) billing and other related information. We will use this information to provide services to you, and will not share this information with third parties without your consent, except to the extent necessary to process your requests (e.g., process a credit card for payment.) 

### Information about how you use our services.

When you interact with Recorded Future, by using our services, posting queries, performing analysis, annotating results, a record of these activities may be collected automatically as a result of your use of the website. When you create this information by engaging in actions like posing queries, doing analysis, annotating results, etc. you should be aware that the information may be collected, stored or archived by Recorded Future. Information about your interaction with Recorded Future (queries, visualizations, analysis, etc.) is saved on our servers until you delete that information or delete your account. While our servers automatically collect information as a consequence of your using the service, we do not examine or inspect individual search queries, and we routinely encrypt the logs related to your searches or inquiries. You should note that, if you have chosen to share results of queries, analysis or similar searches (and similar) with others, copies of that information may remain viewable by those with whom you have shared the query or similar even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account. We log queries you make when you use our system, we anonymize them, but we do not manually inspect them. We will not share your queries with anyone, unless you ask us to do so through the user interface, although you are free to share queries information yourself. 

### Cookies.

When you visit the Recorded Future website, we may send one or more cookies – a small file containing a string of characters – to your computer, mobile phone or other device that uniquely identifies your browser. When you return to our site, we may detect the presence of that cookie, and the information contained in it. We will not share this cookie information with anyone, and will use it solely to provide services to you. 

### Internet Log Information.

When you access any Recorded Future website, network, server, or other electronic asset, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit any website. These logs may include information such as your nature and content of your web request, your Internet Protocol address (and approximate geographic location), browser type and version, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. In the event of an actual or attempted unauthorized or malicious access to our website or servers, we may use this information to conduct investigations and to protect the integrity of your information. 

### Your Communications With Us.

When you send or receive email or other communications with us, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services, to inform you about changes in our policies or pricing or service offerings or to fulfill or respond to requests you may initiate. While we do not currently do so, we may in the future use a service that will let us know when you have received or opened e-mail we have sent to you. We will use this information solely for the purposes of tracking whether or not you have received an e-mail from us for quality control and response purposes. We also offer an e-mail alerting capability called “Futures” which automatically sends information you have requested to an e-mail account you have registered with us. You have ultimate control over the information sent to you through this service, including the nature and scope of the information, and the frequency of such alerts. To access this service and put in your personal controls, visit the Futures management page and update your settings. 

### Links In and Out.

Recorded Future may collect information about sites that have linked to our sites, or sites that we link to. Therefore, Recorded Future may collect information about the website your came from when you were directed to us, or the website you visit as a result of a link on our site. 

## How We Use the Information

### When We Share.

Recorded Future does not share your personal information with any other companies or individuals except for the following: 

**Consent.** We will not share your nonpublic information except to deliver services to you unless you affirmatively opt-in to such sharing. If you share this data with third parties, this is, of course consent to such sharing.

**Legal Requirements.** We may share your information without your consent if we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or valid governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, Terms of Use or contractual obligations including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property, safety or security of Recorded Future, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.

### Sharing in the Event of a Merger or Acquisition.

If Recorded Future becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, the assets of Recorded Future may include “information assets” including the information we have collected about you. In that event, we will continue ensure the confidentiality of any personal information involved in such transactions and provide you with notice before any of your personal information is transferred and may become subject to a different privacy policy. 

### Using Aggregated Information to Improve Our Service.

We may use information about how you have used our service in order to improve our service offering to you or to others. By knowing, for example what kinds of information you are seeking on our site, and the results delivered to you, we may be able to analyze this information to deliver more targeted results. While we will not share the individual search results or what we call “identified” information about your searches or results, we may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users who searched for a particular term, for example, or the nature of the results returned to aggregated users. Such information does not identify you or your searches or results individually. 

## How We Protect Your Information

We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data, including data that relates to your personally identifiable information. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. We restrict access to personal information to Recorded Future employees, contractors and agents (including third party hosting platforms) who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. 

## Data integrity and Quality

Recorded Future processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services or as otherwise permitted under this Policy. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary. 

### Quality of Internet Information.

The information we deliver to our clients and customers, (that is the aggregated, analyzed and indexed information from public sources), is only as accurate as the original source material itself. Thus, we cannot remove information from a public website, blog, posting, filing or other source, and if the underlying information is erroneous, our index of that information will merely reflect what was posted. Therefore, before you act on any information we may provide to you from public sources, you should undertake reasonable steps to validate the accuracy of the information, not merely its existence. We accept no responsibility to validate the accuracy of information posted by others online, nor frankly would we have the ability to do so. 

### Accessing and updating personal information.

When you use Recorded Future services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. 

## Enforcement

Recorded Future regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or Recorded Future’s treatment of personal information by contacting us by e-mal to privacy@recordedfuture.com, or by writing to us at Recorded Future/Privacy Policy, 1 Mifflin Place, Cambridge, MA, 02138, USA. When we receive formal written complaints at this address, it is Recorded Future’s policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between Recorded Future and an individual. 

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. However, we anticipate that most changes to our Privacy Policy will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes). By using, or continuing to use this service after being provided notice of the change is policy, you will be deemed to have consented to the change. Each version of this Privacy Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date, and we will also keep prior version of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.
