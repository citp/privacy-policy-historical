This Privacy Policy covers how Recommended Jobs collects, uses, and shares your personal information when you visit Recommended Jobs' website and when you use Recommended Jobs services.

Recommended Jobs is not responsible for any practices of third parties that we do not own or control. This includes the collection of your information from websites that we may link to. Please review the privacy policies of those sites so that you may better understand how they collect, use, and share your information.

Recommended Jobs encourages you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Your continued use of this site and/or submitting your personally identifiable information to Recommended Jobs will be subject to the then current Privacy Policy.

#### Information That We Collect

Recommended Jobs collects two types of information about you when you use our website and our services. The first type of personal information we collect is anything you actively choose to disclose to Recommended Jobs ("Active Information.") The second type of information is anonymous aggregate information collected in a way that is not visible to you or others visiting the site ("Passive Information.")

#### Active Information

Recommended Jobs may collect or receive Active Information about you when you submit your personally identifiable information, including, but not limited to, your username, password, first and last name, email address, street address, gender, occupation, interests, job search history, and any other data included in any submitted profile or search. Recommended Jobs also collects information on the pages you access through our site and any other information you may volunteer, such as survey information, ratings, reviews, questions, and answers.

#### Passive Information

Recommended Jobs may also collect your Passive Information by recording actions taken by you on our site including, but not limited to, clicks, page views, IP address, and search queries. We may store this information in our equipment or the equipment of third party technology providers. We use this type of information to administer the Site and provide the highest possible level of service to you.

#### How We Use Your Information

Recommended Jobs will only use your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

For the purpose of identifying users and delivering relevant content and advertisements, our partner LiveRamp may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser or a unique ID for your mobile device. To opt-out of LiveRamp cookies, please go [here](http://liveramp.com/opt_out/).

#### Email Communications

Recommended Jobs respects your email preferences and will never provide your email address to a third party without your permission, except as may be prescribed elsewhere in this Privacy Policy. If you provide us your email address, Recommended Jobs may email you job alerts, account notifications, news, offers, surveys, promotions, and other communications. Your contact information is also used to contact you when necessary. Recommended Jobs may use demographic and/or profile data, including but not limited to search history, to tailor your experience on Recommended Jobs' site, show you content that Recommended Jobs thinks you may be interested in, and display content according to your preferences. Recommended Jobs, or companies we partner with, may contact you based on your interests such as job postings and career development opportunities.

#### Website Administration

We may use other companies as necessary to perform services necessary to our operations. In the course of providing these services, those companies may have access to your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Every effort will be made to safeguard your privacy when it may be accessed by other companies, including but not limited to technology providers; however, Recommended Jobs will not be liable for any damages that may result from the misuse of your personal information by these companies.

Recommended Jobs may use your IP address to administer our site. Your IP address may also be used to help identify you, your location, and to gather broad demographic information. Nothing shall restrict Recommended Jobs from maintaining your data following your termination of your use of Recommended Jobs' site. Recommended Jobs may delete your user data at Recommended Jobs' sole discretion.

#### Children's Privacy

Recommended Jobs' site is not intended for and may not be used by children under the age of 13. Recommended Jobs is committed to protecting the privacy needs of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children's online activities. Recommended Jobs does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13, nor does Recommended Jobs target its services or site to children under the age of 13. We recommend that minors between the ages of 13 and 17 ask and receive permission from their parent or guardian prior to using Recommended Jobs or sending information about themselves or anyone else over the Internet.

#### Protect Yourself

Recommended Jobs uses automated processes and third party aggregators to collect and present information that has been created by third parties, so we cannot verify the accuracy or legitimacy of all job postings displayed on our site. We strongly encourage you to exercise caution when providing information about yourself to others online, including when you apply for jobs found on Recommended Jobs.

Never provide your social security number, credit card information, bank account details, or unnecessary personal information to a potential employer. Never participate in a financial transaction of any sort with a potential employer. Always be cautious of opportunities that sound too good to be true or require you to act as a financial intermediary, particularly for an overseas person.
