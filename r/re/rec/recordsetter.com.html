        <h1>RECORDSETTER PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
        <p>Effective Date: 11/15/2008</p>
        <p>Last Updated: 6/28/2011</p>
        <p>Welcome to the RecordSetter. RecordSetter.com and URDB.org (the "RecordSetter 
            sites") are operated by Universal Record Database, LLC (collectively referred to 
            as "RecordSetter," "us," or "we"). RecordSetter cares about your privacy and urges you to read 
            this policy ("Privacy Policy"). This Privacy Policy describes how RecordSetter treats 
            the personal information acquired when you (also referred to as the "User" or 
            "your") use RecordSetter’s services, including a description of what information RecordSetter
            collects, how it is used, and how you can contact RecordSetter regarding the information 
            that is collected or your questions or concerns. This Privacy Policy does not 
            apply to the practices of companies that RecordSetter does not own or control, or to 
            individuals that RecordSetter does not employ or manage, and it is only applicable on 
            the RecordSetter sites. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the 
            RecordSetter <a href="http://recordsetter.com/terms">Terms of Use</a>. If you do not agree to the 
            terms of this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use, please do not provide RecordSetter 
            with any information and do not use the RecordSetter sites. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>RecordSetter reserves the right to periodically modify this Privacy Policy in any manner, 
            including, but not limited to, revising, adding, or removing portions or the 
            entirety of this Privacy Policy. If we do exercise this right, we will attempt 
            to notify you that a modification has occurred at the e-mail address that you 
            have provided us; however, RecordSetter is not liable if we are unable to contact you. 
            Any modification is effective upon the posting of the modified Privacy Policy on 
            the RecordSetter sites by Universal Record Database, LLC. Your continued use of the RecordSetter 
            sites indicates that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by the 
            modified Privacy Policy. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT </h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Personal Information Provided:</b> RecordSetter collects personally identifiable information 
                you voluntarily submit to us, including information you provide when sending us 
                an e-mail. We also collect personally identifiable information that you upload, 
                post, or otherwise transmit to us for public display online, including, but not 
                limited to, any data, text, information, screen names, graphics, photos, 
                accounts, audio and video clips, links, or any other material (collectively 
                "Content"), regardless of who ultimately uploads, posts, or otherwise transmits 
                the materials for display on the RecordSetter sites. Additionally, when you ask us to 
                verify a record, we collect the following information: identification of the 
                record setter, your e-mail address, the record title, the quantifiable data 
                relating to the record, a description of the record attempt, the name and e-mail 
                addresses of at least two witnesses to the record, the location where the record 
                was set, tags to help categorize the record, and media documenting the record 
                attempt. All information that you provide us to verify a record is considered 
                information uploaded, posted, or otherwise transmitted to us for public display 
                except for your e-mail address and the names and e-mail addresses of your 
                witnesses to the record.</li>
            <li><b>Cookies and General Usage Activity:</b> Browsing user-posted records, making 
                            comments regarding records on the RecordSetter sites, and contacting us about a 
                            particular posting is considered “General Usage Activity.” RecordSetter may record 
                            information about your General Usage Activity, including, but not limited to, 
                            when you use RecordSetter, the groups and favorites you subscribe to, the contacts you 
                            communicate with, the videos you watch, the frequency and size of data 
                            transfers, your IP address, your browser type and version, and information you 
                            display or click on in RecordSetter.<br>
                <br>Your General Usage Activity on RecordSetter may result in 
                            the installation of "cookies" (which are bits of information stored on your hard 
                            drive by your browser) and "clear GIFs" (which are invisible images that are 
                            also known as "Web Beacons") to: (a) store information so that you will not have 
                            to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit RecordSetter; (b) provide 
                            custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of 
                            our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of 
                            visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and 
                            status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests. Although you may disable 
                            cookies and clear GIFs in your browser, doing so may limit your availability to 
                            use certain features on the RecordSetter sites. We may also use cookies and clear GIFs 
                            in some of our HTML-based marketing e-mails or newsletters sent to our Users to 
                            track which e-mails are opened by the recipients.</li>
            <li><b>Third-party Information:</b> In addition to the cookies RecordSetter may install to 
                        facilitate your use of the RecordSetter sites, our advertising partners that display 
                        third-party advertisements on the RecordSetter sites may also install cookies. These 
                        cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you 
                        an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your 
                        computer. This information allows advertising networks to, among other things, 
                        deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to 
                        you. This Privacy Policy only covers the collection and use of information by 
                        RecordSetter; it does not cover the collection and use of information by any 
                        third-parties whose services you may access via the RecordSetter sites. In order to 
                        understand what information these third parties gather and how they use it, you 
                        must review the relevant third party's policies.<br>
                <br>Additionally, some Content on 
                        RecordSetter may be hosted on third party sites, including, but not limited to, our 
                        videos. Some information may be collected by these third party sites in 
                        connection with their use. Again, this Privacy Policy only covers the collection 
                        and use of information by RecordSetter; it does not cover the collection and use of 
                        information by any third-parties whose services you may access via the RecordSetter 
                        sites. In order to understand what information these third parties gather and 
                        how they use it, you must review the relevant third party's policies.</li>
        </ul>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;</p>
                    <h2>2. INTERNAL INFORMATION USE </h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>E-Mail address: </b>RecordSetter may use your e-mail address without further consent 
                            for non-marketing or administrative purposes, such as notifying you of major 
                            changes to the RecordSetter site or for customer service purposes. RecordSetter will not use 
                            your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information to send 
                            commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a 
                            specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or 
                            opt-out.</li>
                        <li><b>Other Personal Information Provided: </b>If you voluntarily provide us with 
                            personally identifiable information, RecordSetter will use your personal information to 
                            operate, maintain, and provide to you the general and personalized features and 
                            functionality of RecordSetter, and to process any correspondence you send to us. 
                            Additionally, any personal information that you upload, post, or otherwise 
                            transmit to us for public display online becomes publicly available and can be 
                            collected and used by others. Indeed, your record documentation may be 
                            redistributed through the Internet and other media channels, and may be viewed 
                            by the general public. However, the personal information you provide us for your 
                            witnesses to the record is only used by RecordSetter to contact the witnesses to verify 
                            the record and to obtain information if RecordSetter has questions regarding the record, 
                            and it is not shared with any third parties. Similarly, we will only use your 
                            provided e-mail address in a request to verify a record or to contact you about 
                            that record. Note, however, that if you have also provided that e-mail address 
                            in your Member Profile, you are choosing to make it publicly available and 
                            additional uses may be made as described above.</li>
                        <li><b>Cookies and General Usage Activity: </b>Only RecordSetter has access to any cookies 
                            or clear GIFs RecordSetter installs on your computer. RecordSetter uses the data we collect 
                            about General Usage Activity in conjunction with the information provided in 
                            your Member Profile to improve the quality and design of RecordSetter and to create new 
                            features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, 
                            analyzing, and processing User preferences and trends, as well as User activity 
                            and communications.</li>
                        <li><b>Third-party Information: </b>As noted above, this Privacy Policy only covers 
                            the collection and use of information by RecordSetter; it does not cover the collection

                            the RecordSetter sites. In order to understand what information these third parties 
                            gather and how they use it, you must review the relevant third party's policies.</li>

                        3. THIRD-PARTY INFORMATION USE</h2>
                    <p>
                        RecordSetter will not sell your personally identifiable information to third parties for 
                        marketing purposes. RecordSetter may share or sell to third parties aggregate 
                        information in a form that does not include anything that could be used to 
                        identify you or to discover individual information about you. This includes, but 
                        is not limited to, the sharing and selling of aggregate General Usage Data or 
                        demographic information about our users and their use of the RecordSetter sites.</p>
        <p>
            RecordSetter also reserves the right to distribute User records to third parties for 
            public or private display, with or without monetary gain, from the time of 
            posting into perpetuity. By posting a record to RecordSetter, you acknowledge and assent 
            to this right. Unlike aggregate information, the records may include information 
            that could be used to identify you, such as the name you provide as the record 
            holder as well as your personal likeness or image in any documentation of the 
            record. If RecordSetter undergoes a sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, 
            transfer of substantial assets, reorganization or liquidation, all of RecordSetter's 
            accumulated information, including, but not limited to, personally identifiable 
            information will be treated as an asset. Like other business assets, this 
            information will be subject to transfer to or acquisition by a third party. The 
            acquiring party will assume the rights and obligations regarding this 
            information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>
            RecordSetter may also disclose your personally identifiable information if we are 
            required to do so by law or we in good faith believe that such action is 
            necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process; (2) protect and 
            defend RecordSetter's rights and property; (3) protect against misuse or unauthorized 
            use of RecordSetter; or (4) protect the personal safety or property of our Users, 
            including you, or the public. This includes, but is not limited to, the 
            disclosure of personally identifiable information to law enforcement officials 
            if you provide false information or attempt to pose as someone else as part of 
            any investigation into your actions.</p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;</p>
        <h2>
            4. SECURITY
        </h2>
        <p>
            RecordSetter takes many precautions to keep your personal information secure from 
            unauthorized access, misuse, or alteration. This includes internal corporate 
            policies to limit access to systems that store your personal information. 
            However, the Internet is an open system and technology and human operators are 
            not infallible. Accordingly, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any 
            information transmitted to us over the Internet, and we accept no liability for 
            any unintentional disclosure.</p>
