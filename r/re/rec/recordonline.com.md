This privacy policy was last updated on 6/22/01._  
   Ottaway Newspapers, Inc., the parent company of Ottaway Newspaper Group, and its affiliates (collectively referred to as "Ottaway", "we", "us" or "our", as applicable) are committed to maintaining the privacy of personal information that you provide to us when using their respective web sites (the "Ottaway Web Sites"). This Privacy Policy describes how we treat personal information received about you when you visit the Ottaway Web Sites. 

**Information Collected  
**   Web Site Usage Information: We automatically collects IP addresses and web site usage information from you when you visit the Ottaway Web Sites. This information helps us in evaluating how our visitors use and navigate the Ottaway Web Sites on an aggregate basis, including the number and frequency of visitors to each page of the Ottaway Web Sites, and the length of their visits.   
   Special Features: When you use some of the special features of the Ottaway Web Sites and at other times, we may collect personally identifiable information from you that may include your name, age, address, e-mail address, credit-card number and facts about your interests and similar information.   
   Surveys and Form: We may conduct occasional online surveys or ask you to fill in forms. For example, when you are within the Ottaway Web Sites, you may see a pop-up window offering you the optional opportunity of participating in a survey. These surveys and forms are entirely voluntary and you may easily decline to participate.  
   Children: We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13 although certain third party sites that we link to may do so. These third-party sites have their own terms of use and privacy policies and we encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children to never provide information on the Ottaway Web Sites without their permission.

**How We Use Information Collected  
**

   We may use information that you provide us in the following ways:   
\- For the purposes for which you specifically provided the information, for example, when you request that additional information be sent to you, we will use your personal information to process your request.   
\- To send you e-mail notifications about our new or existing services, special offers, or to otherwise contact you.   
\- To allow us to personalize the content and advertising that you and others see based on personal characteristics or preferences.  
\- To enhance existing features or develop new features, products and services.   
\- To provide advertisers and other third parties with aggregate information about our user base and usage patterns.   
   We may combine the information that we collect from you on the Ottaway Web Sites with information that you provide to us in connection with your use of our other products, services and web sites.   
   We use third party network advertisers to deliver ads to you on our behalf. We may also use third-party service providers to contact you on our behalf, or facilitate some aspects of our services or fulfill your requests. These network advertisers and service providers may be supplied with or have access to your personally identifiable information solely for the purpose of providing these services to us or on our behalf.   
   We may disclose and use personally identifiable information in special circumstances where it is necessary to enforce our Terms of Use (for example, when necessary to protect our intellectual property rights) or when we, in our sole discretion, believe it is necessary or appropriate, in connection with a sale or transfer of some or all of our assets in the Ottaway Web Sites. We may also disclose personally identifiable information when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires us to do so. As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In transactions such as these, customer information is generally one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, in the unlikely event that we or one of our publishing lines are acquired, customer information may be one of the transferred assets.  
   Except as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your personally identifiable information outside of Ottaway unless you "opt in" to having your personally identifiable information shared with a company that is not affiliated with us.
