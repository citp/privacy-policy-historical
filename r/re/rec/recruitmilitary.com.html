									<br>
									RecruitMilitary has created this privacy 
									statement in order to demonstrate our firm 
									commitment to protecting the privacy of our 
									users. Your privacy is very important to us. 
									We want to provide a safe, secure experience 
									for all of our users. Because we gather 
									certain types of information about users of 
									our site, we feel you should be aware of the 
									terms surrounding the capture and use of 
									that information. Strong electronic privacy 
									is an essential ingredient in the success of 
									the Internet as an online medium. The 
									following discloses what information we 
									gather, how we use or disseminate it, and 
									how you can change it.<br>
									<br>
									<strong>Information We Gather</strong><br>
									<br>
									We collect statistical information such as 
									page views on an aggregated basis. Such 
									information allows us to find out what areas 
									users visit most frequently and what 
									services users access the most. It also 
									allows us to create a better overall 
									experience for our users. We may share this 
									information with our partners, but only in 
									the aggregate, so that they too may 
									understand how RecruitMilitary.com visitors 
									use our site, so they may create a better 
									overall experience for you, as well. 
									Aggregated data is essential to keeping 
									RecruitMilitary.com free to users.
									<ul>
										<li><strong>Email this job to a friend.</strong> 
										On certain pages at our site, users may 
										elect to electronically forward a job 
										listing to a friend by clicking a link 
										adjacent to the specific job listing. 
										The user must provide two email 
										addresses: one for the user and one for 
										the friend. This information is used 
										only to let the recipient know who sent 
										the job listing.<br>
										<br>
										</li>
										<li><strong>Cookies.</strong> To enhance 
										your experience at RecruitMilitary.com, 
										we use a feature on your Internet 
										browser called a "cookie". Cookies are 
										small bits of data that are written to 
										your hard drive when you visit a web 
										site. A cookie file can contain 
										information such as a user or session ID 
										to track the pages you've visited or a 
										user name and password so you don't have 
										to re-enter it throughout your visit. A 
										cookie can't read data off of your hard 
										drive or read other cookies created by 
										other web sites. We use cookies for 
										remembering user names and passwords and 
										preferences, tracking click streams, and 
										for load balancing. We also use cookies 
										at our site to better understand how 
										users visit our site so that we know 
										what areas and features are the most 
										popular. Because of our use of cookies, 
										we can deliver quicker service and a 
										more personalized site experience for 
										our users. You are always free to reject 
										cookies by turning them off in your 
										browser. However, doing this will hinder 
										performance and negatively impact your 
										experience at our site.<br>
										<br>
										</li>
										<li><strong>Feedback.</strong> 
										RecruitMilitary.com has an area on the 
										site where you can submit feedback. Any 
										feedback that is submitted through this 
										area becomes the property of 
										RecruitMilitary.com. We may use this 
										feedback, such as success stories, for 
										marketing purposes, or to contact you 
										for further feedback on the site.<br>
										<br>
										</li>
										<li><strong>Resumes.</strong> 
										RecruitMilitary.com gives you two 
										options when submitting your resume to 
										our online database:<br>
										<br>
										1. You can store your resume in our 
										database, but not allow certain features 
										such as name or personal references to 
										be viewable by potential employers. The 
										resume is still searchable however.<br>
										<br>
										2. If you allow your resume to be 
										searchable, then all employers and 
										recruiters who have access to our resume 
										database will have access to your 
										resume. We use our best efforts to grant 
										access to this database only to paying 
										employers, recruiters, hiring managers, 
										headhunters, and human resource 
										professionals, but cannot guarantee that 
										other parties will not, without our 
										consent, gain access to this database. 
										You may remove your resume from our 
										searchable database at any time. 
										However, employers and recruiters who 
										have access to the database, and other 
										parties who have otherwise gained access 
										to the database, may have retained a 
										copy of your resume in their own files 
										or databases. We are not responsible for 
										the retention, use, or privacy of 
										resumes in these instances, or for the 
										use or privacy of resumes by any of such 
										parties while resumes are in the 
										database.<br>
										<br>
										3. The Department of Labor, Office of 
										Federal Contract Compliance Programs 
										regulation at 41 CFR Part 60-1 
										(Obligation to Solicit Race and Gender 
										Data for Agency Enforcement Purposes, 
										also known as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Internet ApplicantÃ¢â‚¬Â 
										rule), requires RecruitMilitary to 
										maintain your records for a period of 
										two years. <br>
										<br>
										</li>
										<li><strong>Links.</strong> This site 
										may contain links to other sites. We are 
										not responsible for the privacy 
										practices or the content of such web 
										sites. We do not control cookies from 
										other outside sites. </li>
									</ul>
									<strong>How We Use the Information</strong><br>
									<br>
									RecruitMilitary.com uses your information on 
									an aggregated basis to create traffic 
									reports, deliver up-to-date information, and 
									enhance user experience. This also allows us 
									to better anticipate the needs of our users 
									and tailor future content based on user 
									interest. Clients will be able to better 
									understand our demographics and response 
									rates to job listings.<br>
									<br>
									We will not sell your e-mail address or your 
									name and personal demographic information to 
									mass marketers or mailing list distributors. 
									Except as described in this privacy policy, 
									we do not disclose information about your 
									individual visits to RecruitMilitary.com, or 
									personal information that you provide, such 
									as your name, address, e-mail address, 
									telephone number, personal references, etc., 
									to any outside parties, except when we 
									believe it is required by law or to protect 
									RecruitMilitary.com. We do share 
									information, with candidate permission, with 
									client companies who utilize our service to 
									place candidates into specific job 
									positions.<br>
									<br>
									RecruitMilitary.com may, from time to time, 
									use e-mail addresses that users voluntarily 
									provide in order to send out electronic 
									newsletters. We may use the mailing list to 
									occasionally send users information about 
									new job positions or updates to the site.<br>
									<br>
									<strong>How You Can Change the Information</strong><br>
									<br>
									RecruitMilitary.com gives its users an 
									option to "Opt Out" of receiving information 
									such as e-mail updates or newsletters via 
									their user accounts. Users are free to 
									deactivate their profile at any time. 
									RecruitMilitary.com allows you to change or 
									correct your personal information at any 
									time. To do so, simply log into your 
									account, go to your account profile, and you 
									will find options for editing the 
									information you submitted during initial 
									registration.<br>
									<br>
									<strong>Security</strong><br>
									<br>
									This site has security measures in place to 
									protect the loss, misuse and alteration of 
									the information under our control. We will 
									ensure the proper safeguarding of your 
									personal information.<br>
									<br>
									<strong>Children's Guidelines</strong><br>
									<br>
									We do not specifically collect information 
									about children. We believe that children 
									should get their parents' consent before 
									giving out personal information. If you are 
									concerned about your child's use of this 
									site, we encourage you to use Web filtering 
									technology to supervise your child's access 
									to the site. We also encourage you to 
									participate in your child's experience 
									whenever they are using the Internet.<br>
									<br>
									<strong>Contact Information</strong><br>
									<br>
									This Privacy Policy may be modified from 
									time to time. Any notices that reflect a 
									change will be posted on this page, so check 
									back often. We hope this privacy policy 
									clarifies our handling of your personal 
									information. If, at any time, you have 
									questions or concerns about our privacy 
									policy, please feel free to contact us.<br>
