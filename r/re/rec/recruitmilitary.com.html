										<b>Privacy Policy</b><br>
										<br>
										RecruitMilitary LLC has created this privacy statement in 
    									order to demonstrate our firm commitment to protecting the privacy of our users. Your privacy is very important
    									to us. We want to provide a safe, secure experience for all of our users. Because we gather certain types of 
    									information about users of our site, we feel you should be aware of the terms surrounding the capture and use of
    									that information. Strong electronic privacy is an essential ingredient in the success of the Internet as an online
    									medium. The following discloses what information we gather, how we use or disseminate it, and how you can change 
    									it.<br>
                						<br>
    								<b>Information We Gather</b><br>
    								<br>
    								We collect statistical information such as page views on an aggregated basis. Such information allows us to find
    								out what areas users visit most frequently and what services users access the most. It also allows us to create a
    								better overall experience for our users. We may share this information with our partners, but only in the aggregate,
    								so that they too may understand how RecruitMilitary.com visitors use our site, so they may create a better overall
    								experience for you, as well. Aggregated data is essential to keeping RecruitMilitary.com free to users.
    								<ul>
    									<li><b>Email this job to a friend.</b>	On certain pages at our site, users may elect to electronically forward 
    									a job listing to a friend by clicking a link adjacent to the specific job listing. The user must provide two email
    									addresses: one for the user and one for the friend. This information is used only to let the recipient know who sent
    									the job listing.</li><br>
        								<br>
        								<li><b>Cookies.</b> To enhance your experience at RecruitMilitary.com, we use a feature on your Internet browser
                 						called a "cookie". Cookies are small bits of data that are written to your hard drive when you visit a
                 						web site. A cookie file can contain information such as a user or session ID to track the pages you've visited 
                 						or a user name and password so you don't have to re-enter it throughout your visit. A cookie can't read data off
                 						of your hard drive or read other cookies created by other web sites. We use cookies for remembering user names and
                 						passwords and preferences, tracking click streams, and for load balancing. We also use cookies at our site to better
                 						understand how users visit our site so that we know what areas and features are the most popular. Because of our use 
                 						of cookies, we can deliver quicker service and a more personalized site experience for our users. You are always free
                 						to reject cookies by turning them off in your browser. However, doing this will hinder performance and negatively 
                 						impact your experience at our site.</li><br>
                 						<br>
                 						<li><b>Feedback.</b> RecruitMilitary.com has an area on the site where you can submit feedback. Any feedback that 
                 						is submitted through this area becomes the property of RecruitMilitary.com. We may use this feedback, such as success
                 						stories, for marketing purposes, or to contact you for further feedback on the site.</li><br>
                 						<br>
                 						<li><b>Resumes.</b> RecruitMilitary.com gives you two options when submitting your resume to our online database:<br>
                 						<br>
                	 					1. You can store your resume in our database, but not allow certain features such as name or personal references to be 
                 						viewable by potential employers. The resume is still searchable however.<br>
                 						<br>
                 						2. If you allow your resume to be searchable, then all employers and recruiters who have access to our resume database
                 						will have access to your resume. We use our best efforts to grant access to this database only to paying employers, recruiters,
                 						hiring managers, headhunters, and human resource professionals, but cannot guarantee that other parties will not, without our
                 						consent, gain access to this database. You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time. However, employers 
                 						and recruiters who have access to the database, and other parties who have otherwise gained access to the database, 
                 						may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use, or 
                 						privacy of resumes in these instances, or for the use or privacy of resumes by any of such parties while resumes are in the 
                 						database.<br>
                 						<br>
                 						3. The Department of Labor, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs regulation at 41 CFR Part 60-1 (Obligation to Solicit 
                 						Race and Gender Data for Agency Enforcement Purposes, also known as “Internet Applicant” rule), requires RecruitMilitary to 
                 						maintain your records for a period of two years.</li><br>
                 						<br>
                 						<li><b>Links. </b>This site may contain links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the 
                 						content of such web sites. We do not control cookies from other outside sites.</li>
										</ul>
                 						<b>How We Use the Information</b><br>
                 						<br>
                 						RecruitMilitary.com uses your information on an aggregated basis to create traffic reports, deliver up-to-date
                 						information, and enhance user experience. This also allows us to better anticipate the needs of our users 
                 						and tailor future content based on user interest. Clients will be able to better understand our demographics 
                 						and response rates to job listings.<br>
                 						<br>
                 						We will not sell your e-mail address or your name and personal demographic information to mass marketers or 
                 						mailing list distributors. Except as described in this privacy policy, we do not disclose information about your
                 						individual visits to RecruitMilitary.com, or personal information that you provide, such as your name, address,
                 						e-mail address, telephone number, personal references, etc., to any outside parties, except when we believe it 
                 						is required by law or to protect RecruitMilitary.com. We do share information, with candidate permission, with 
                 						client companies who utilize our service to place candidates into specific job positions.<br>
                 						<br> 
                 						RecruitMilitary.com may, from time to time, use e-mail addresses that users voluntarily provide in order to 
                 						send out electronic newsletters. We may use the mailing list to occasionally send users information about new
                 						job positions or updates to the site.<br>
                 						<br>
                 						<b>How You Can Change the Information</b><br>
                 						<br>
                 						RecruitMilitary.com gives its users an option to "Opt Out" of receiving information such as e-mail updates
                 						or newsletters via their user accounts. Users are free to deactivate their profile at any time. RecruitMilitary.com
                 						allows you to change or correct your personal information at any time. To do so, simply log into your account, go to
                 						your account profile, and you will find options for editing the information you submitted during initial registration.<br>
                 						<br>
                 						<b>Security</b><br>
                 						<br>
                 						This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our
                 						control. We will ensure the proper safeguarding of your personal information.<br>
                 						<br>
                 						<b>Children's Guidelines</b><br>
                 						<br>
 										We do not specifically collect information about children. We believe that children should get their parents' consent 
 										before giving out personal information. If you are concerned about your child's use of this site, we encourage you
 										to use Web filtering technology to supervise your child's access to the site. We also encourage you to participate 
 										in your child's experience whenever they are using the Internet.<br>
                 						<br>
                 						<b>Contact Information</b><br>
                 						<br>
                 						This Privacy Policy may be modified from time to time. Any notices that reflect a change will be posted on this 
                 						page, so check back often. We hope this privacy policy clarifies our handling of your personal information. If, at
