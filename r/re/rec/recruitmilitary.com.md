# Privacy Policy

RecruitMilitary LLC (“RecruitMilitary”) has created this privacy policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to protecting the privacy of our users. Your privacy is very important to us. We want to provide a safe, secure experience for all of our users. Because we gather certain types of information about users of our site, we feel you should be aware of the terms surrounding the gathering and use of that information. 

##  WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT, AND HOW DO WE USE IT? 

###  Personal Information 

We collect personally identifiable information that you supply to us voluntarily through the use of our website, such as your name, résumé, personal references, payment information, feedback, or email address. 

We may use that information to respond to an email or other inquiry or request, to help improve our website or our services, to customize your experience using our website, or to send updates, electronic newsletters, or notices about RecruitMilitary or the services we offer, which we believe may be of some interest to you. We may combine this information with other generally or publicly available information in order to help us identify the preferences or interests of visitors to our website. 

Subject to the restrictions described in the “Résumés” section below, we may share this information with client companies that utilize our service to place or hire candidates into specific job positions. If you have indicated that you have an interest in franchising, entrepreneurial, or educational activities, we may also share this information with client and affiliate companies who utilize our service for assisting candidates with such activities. We may also provide this information to companies that assist us in the provision of our services, including helping us fulfill your request for information or placement in a job position. Finally, we may share this information with select third party companies that may contact you directly with special and promotional offers for their goods or services. 

We also reserve the right to disclose personally identifiable information if: (1) the disclosure is necessary or useful to our provision of services; (2) we believe in good faith the disclosure is required by law (such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order); (3) we believe in good faith the disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, interests, or property; or (4) we are acting in good faith to protect an individual’s personal safety. 

Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we do not disclose information about your individual visits to RecruitMilitary.com or your personal information to any outside parties. 

###  Résumés and Profiles 

If you submit your résumé and profile information to the RecruitMilitary online job board database, it will be viewable by potential employers, and all employers and recruiters who have access to our résumé database will have access to your résumé. We use our best efforts to grant access to this database only to employers, educational institutions, franchisors, recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters, and human resource professionals, but cannot guarantee that other parties will not, without our consent, gain access to this database. You may remove your information from our searchable database at any time; however, parties who have access to the database may have retained a copy of your information, including your résumé and profile information, in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of résumés in these instances, or for the use or privacy of your information by any of such parties while résumés are in the database. 

Please be aware that the Department of Labor, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs regulation at 41 CFR Part 60-1 (Obligation to Solicit Race and Gender Data for Agency Enforcement Purposes, also known as “Internet Applicant” rule), requires RecruitMilitary to maintain your records for a period of two years.
