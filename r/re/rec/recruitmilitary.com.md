# RecruitMilitary.com - Privacy Policy

**Privacy Policy**

RecruitMilitary LLC has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to protecting the privacy of our users. Your privacy is very important to us. We want to provide a safe, secure experience for all of our users. Because we gather certain types of information about users of our site, we feel you should be aware of the terms surrounding the capture and use of that information. Strong electronic privacy is an essential ingredient in the success of the Internet as an online medium. The following discloses what information we gather, how we use or disseminate it, and how you can change it.

**Information We Gather**

We collect statistical information such as page views on an aggregated basis. Such information allows us to find out what areas users visit most frequently and what services users access the most. It also allows us to create a better overall experience for our users. We may share this information with our partners, but only in the aggregate, so that they too may understand how RecruitMilitary.com visitors use our site, so they may create a better overall experience for you, as well. Aggregated data is essential to keeping RecruitMilitary.com free to users. 

  * **Email this job to a friend.** On certain pages at our site, users may elect to electronically forward a job listing to a friend by clicking a link adjacent to the specific job listing. The user must provide two email addresses: one for the user and one for the friend. This information is used only to let the recipient know who sent the job listing.
  *  **Cookies.** To enhance your experience at RecruitMilitary.com, we use a feature on your Internet browser called a "cookie". Cookies are small bits of data that are written to your hard drive when you visit a web site. A cookie file can contain information such as a user or session ID to track the pages you've visited or a user name and password so you don't have to re-enter it throughout your visit. A cookie can't read data off of your hard drive or read other cookies created by other web sites. We use cookies for remembering user names and passwords and preferences, tracking click streams, and for load balancing. We also use cookies at our site to better understand how users visit our site so that we know what areas and features are the most popular. Because of our use of cookies, we can deliver quicker service and a more personalized site experience for our users. You are always free to reject cookies by turning them off in your browser. However, doing this will hinder performance and negatively impact your experience at our site.
  *  **Feedback.** RecruitMilitary.com has an area on the site where you can submit feedback. Any feedback that is submitted through this area becomes the property of RecruitMilitary.com. We may use this feedback, such as success stories, for marketing purposes, or to contact you for further feedback on the site.
  *  **Resumes.** RecruitMilitary.com gives you two options when submitting your resume to our online database:

1\. You can store your resume in our database, but not allow certain features such as name or personal references to be viewable by potential employers. The resume is still searchable however.

2\. If you allow your resume to be searchable, then all employers and recruiters who have access to our resume database will have access to your resume. We use our best efforts to grant access to this database only to paying employers, recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters, and human resource professionals, but cannot guarantee that other parties will not, without our consent, gain access to this database. You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time. However, employers and recruiters who have access to the database, and other parties who have otherwise gained access to the database, may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of resumes in these instances, or for the use or privacy of resumes by any of such parties while resumes are in the database.

3\. The Department of Labor, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs regulation at 41 CFR Part 60-1 (Obligation to Solicit Race and Gender Data for Agency Enforcement Purposes, also known as “Internet Applicant” rule), requires RecruitMilitary to maintain your records for a period of two years.

  *  **Links.** This site may contain links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites. We do not control cookies from other outside sites.

**How We Use the Information**

RecruitMilitary.com uses your information on an aggregated basis to create traffic reports, deliver up-to-date information, and enhance user experience. This also allows us to better anticipate the needs of our users and tailor future content based on user interest. Clients will be able to better understand our demographics and response rates to job listings.

We will not sell your e-mail address or your name and personal demographic information to mass marketers or mailing list distributors. Except as described in this privacy policy, we do not disclose information about your individual visits to RecruitMilitary.com, or personal information that you provide, such as your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, personal references, etc., to any outside parties, except when we believe it is required by law or to protect RecruitMilitary.com. We do share information, with candidate permission, with client companies who utilize our service to place candidates into specific job positions.

RecruitMilitary.com may, from time to time, use e-mail addresses that users voluntarily provide in order to send out electronic newsletters. We may use the mailing list to occasionally send users information about new job positions or updates to the site.

**How You Can Change the Information**

RecruitMilitary.com gives its users an option to "Opt Out" of receiving information such as e-mail updates or newsletters via their user accounts. Users are free to deactivate their profile at any time. RecruitMilitary.com allows you to change or correct your personal information at any time. To do so, simply log into your account, go to your account profile, and you will find options for editing the information you submitted during initial registration.

**Security**

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. We will ensure the proper safeguarding of your personal information.

**Children's Guidelines**

We do not specifically collect information about children. We believe that children should get their parents' consent before giving out personal information. If you are concerned about your child's use of this site, we encourage you to use Web filtering technology to supervise your child's access to the site. We also encourage you to participate in your child's experience whenever they are using the Internet.
