# Disclosure, Disclaimer & Privacy Policies - Recipes That Crock!

## Disclosure Information

This blog is a personal blog written and edited by me, Aunt Lou and occasionally Puddie. (We don’t have a staff)  For questions about this blog, please contact [cris@recipesthatcrock.com](mailto:cris@recipesthatcrock.com) .

This blog accepts forms of cash advertising, sponsorship, or other forms of compensation, such as free products to review and giveaway. (Mama likes to pay the bills and the fam likes free stuff)

This blog abides by word of mouth marketing standards. We believe in honesty of relationship, opinion and identity.  (Not here to trick anyone) The compensation received may influence the advertising content, topics or posts made in this blog. (Sometimes I am going to post about that awesome free stuff) That content, advertising space or post will be clearly identified as paid or sponsored content. (Not going to hide it, yo)

The owner(s) of this blog is compensated to provide opinion on products, services, websites and various other topics (Dude, I gots opinions and if they are going to pay me for it, don’t hate). Even though the owner(s) of this blog receives compensation for our posts or advertisements, we always give our honest opinions, findings, beliefs, or experiences on those topics or products (I’ve said it a million times, I don’t post what I don’t believe in. I have had to turn down products in the past and don’t hesitate to do so, yo). The views and opinions expressed on this blog are purely the bloggers’ own (I am my own woman, ya hear *shakes fist in air sarcastically*). Any product claim, statistic, quote or other representation about a product or service should be verified with the manufacturer, provider or party in question.(I am not an expert or a salesman… have your people call their people… remember, I don’t gots people ;))

The owner(s) of this blog would like to disclose the following existing relationships (my peeps). These are companies, organizations or individuals that may have a significant impact on the content of this blog (cause I love ‘em). I was raised on a farm and very much support today’s farmers. Additionally, I am employed by and/or consult with various farm related organizations including Indiana Family of Farmers and it’s associated organizations. This association just so happens to go very well with my love of food and truth be told, yours too 

Additional ongoing relationships include:

  * I am a head over heels fan of Gooseberry Patch Cookbooks, and I often receive free cookbooks from them for myself and to give away in exchange for my honest review. (Dude, GP is awesome and they have blessed me with a lot of cookbook giveaways for you… say it with me… Mommy Score!)
  * All links to Amazon products on this blog are affiliate links. (We also heart Amazon and great prices! We shop and find great deals, share them with you,  you shop and we get a percentage (at no cost to you) so we can shop some more… it is an awesome circle of shoppiness!)
