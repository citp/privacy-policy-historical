At REcolorado, we are fully committed to the protection and security of any information you provide to us as visitors to our website. We want you to know that we truly respect and will protect your privacy, so you can enjoy using our site in your search for properties in the Denver Colorado area. This is the Privacy Policy for the REcolorado.com website. This Privacy Policy discloses our approach to privacy and how your personal information is collected and used. Your use of our website constitutes your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and your consent to the practices it describes. 

### What Information We Collect

Generally speaking, our website is informational. Your “personally identifiable information,” that is, information about you as an individual which would permit someone to contact you, such as your email address, is only provided if you email us with questions or for any other reason. Otherwise, we do not collect any personally identifiable information from you unless you voluntarily provide it.

As is the case when you visit most websites, to administer our site, your visit triggers the automatic logging of certain anonymous information about your computer system such as the type of browser you use, the server name and your “IP” (Internet Protocol) address. When your web browser or email application requests a web page or email from another computer using the Internet, it automatically gives that computer your computer’s “address” so it knows where it should send the information. This is called your computer’s “IP address.” This anonymous information does not contain any personally identifiable information.

### How We Protect Your Information

We also want you to know that we take the security of your information very seriously and that we take appropriate measures to protect the files in our data system. You need to know, however, that due to the open communication nature of the Internet we cannot guarantee that communication between you and us, and between us and you, will be free from unauthorized access by third parties nor can we be responsible for information stolen from our servers by information harvesting software which may have the ability to scrape data.

### Third Party Sites and Applications

Your use of these third party applications is subject to their respective Terms and other policies, if applicable. REcolorado.com includes links to other third party websites.

We are not responsible for the availability of any other site to which this site links. We do not take responsibility for the contents, advertising, products, privacy policies or other material made available through any other site. Please direct your concerns to that other site’s webmaster or appropriate contact. 

### We Do Not Sell or Rent Your Personally Identifiable Information

If you provide personally identifiable information to us, please know we do not share your personally identifiable information with third parties for promotional use without your consent. We may, however, have to disclose, transfer, sell or assign any information obtained through this website, or otherwise in our possession, to a third party as a result of a sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial assets, reorganization or liquidation of REcolorado.
