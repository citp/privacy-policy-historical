      <p><strong><em>Updated 03/06/10</em></strong><br>
<br>
At RecruitIreland.com we take your privacy and the protection of your information seriously. We have created this policy in line with the Data Protection Commissioner to demonstrate this commitment and to tell you how we handle and use your data.<br>
<br>
If after reading this policy you have any questions please contact us using the details below.<br>
<br>
Please review this statement periodically as we will amend and update it from time to time. This policy relates to transactions and activities in which you voluntarily engage and it relates to data gathered on RecruitIreland.com but it does not extend to any offline activities between you and any of our third party advertisers.<br>
<br>
We endeavour to comply with the guidelines laid out by Ireland’s Data Commissioner in the collection, protection and distribution of data we may collect about you on our website. You should be aware of your rights and your right to contact us;<br>

<br>
By using our website you consent to our online/website privacy policy.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h2>Site Security</h2><br>
<p>At RecruitIreland.com we make every effort to protect your data which you provide to us. We consistently monitor our servers for unauthorised access and we have appropriate security management systems in place to safeguard this. Anti-virus software and Firewalls are installed on all areas of the site as well as an additional secure socket layer when you log into your account online.<br>
<br>
We do recognise however that unfortunately no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed 100% secure. As a result we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide to us, you do so at your own risk.<br>
<br>
Where we have issued you with a username and password or you have registered one with us, it is your responsibility to keep this safe and not disclose it. If you are registering the username and password online we advise you not to use a password you already use on any other website.<br>
<br>
If you have changed your email address it is your responsibility to inform us.<br>
<br>
We will always ask for additional information to correctly identify your account before we give out any information over the phone.<br>
<br>
Third party activities relating to any advertiser you submitted your information to via RecruitIreland.com are beyond our control. We urge you to review the privacy policy of such advertisers to ensure your information is secure once it is transferred to that third party. If you wish to modify any information submitted to an advertiser you must contact them directly as they are responsible for that information.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h2>Advertisers</h2><br>
<p>We offer the use of a secure server for all online payments. All information is secured by Realex our payment provider. After a transaction is concluded your credit card/debit card details will not be stored on file or in our servers.</p>
<br>
<h2>What information do we collect?</h2><br>

<p>We only request information which is necessary for us to fulfil our service obligations for which you visit the website.<br>
<br>
When you register on our site we collect information, you may be asked to enter your name, postal address, email address, phone number, sector of employment and job title. When you register for our newsletter or job alerts we also store this information.<br>
<br>
If you apply for a job we store this information against your account on our database. If you apply as a guest user we store your email address (which you enter voluntarily) against the job specification you applied for.<br>
<br>
If you upload a CV to your account we store this on file. If you opt into our CV Search Service we also store this information. When you opt in to the CV Search Service we also ask you to submit your salary requirements, a free text description of your work experience, your level of education, availability to work, if you are authorised to work in the EU, any language fluency skills, if you have a driver’s license and what type of employment you would prefer (permanent, temporary etc).<br>
<br>
We may also keep a record of any contact you have with us.<br>
<br>
<strong>What do we use this information for?</strong><br>
<br>
Any of the information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To notify you of any changes to the website or service</li>
        <li>To notify you of any new roles which fit your needs as specified by you when you registered voluntarily for our Job Alert service</li>
        <li>To notify you of any survey or survey results which might be of interest to you</li>
        <li>To improve our customer service levels to you – your information helps us to respond efficiently and effectively to your support requests.</li>
        <li>To provide advertisers of the website with information you have requested we send onto them in reference to a specific role they as an employer or registered recruitment agency have advertised on the website. Your application for a role on the website is taken as permission to forward your information.</li>
        <li>You can control information sent forward or displayed online if you have opted into our CV Search service through your user account. You can also opt-out of our CV Search service through your user account at any time.</li>
        <li>If you opt-out of the service entirely we will deactivate your account and remove your contact and login details from our database.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>      Your information whether public or private will not be sold, exchanged, transferred or given to any other company for any reason whatsoever without your express consent other than for the express purpose of delivering the purchased product or service requested.</p>
          <br>
      <h2>Information other sites collect from you</h2><br>
          <p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. Google, for example, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to you based on your visit to our site and other sites on the Internet. You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here: <a href="http://networkadvertising.org/index.asp">http://networkadvertising.org/index.asp</a>.</p><br>

      <h2>IP Addresses and Cookies</h2><br>

          <p>We may collect information about your computer including if available, your IP Address, Operating System, Browser Type and Location for statistical and behavioural tracking. This information helps us to enhance our service to you. This does not identify any individual; it is used as a tool to gather broad levels of data for analysis and to measure audience size and patterns of usage such as visitor numbers and how unique they are.<br>
          <br>
          We may also collect a cookie file for the same reason, these are small files that a site or service provider transfers to your hard drive through your browser which essentially enables us to remember certain non-identifiable information. You can disable cookies through Internet options on your browser menu at any time.<br>
</p>
