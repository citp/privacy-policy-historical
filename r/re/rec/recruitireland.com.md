At RecruitIreland.com we make every effort to protect your data which you provide to us. We consistently monitor our servers for unauthorised access and we have appropriate security management systems in place to safeguard this. Anti-virus software and Firewalls are installed on all areas of the site.

We do recognise however that unfortunately no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed 100% secure. As a result we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide to us, you do so at your own risk.

Where we have issued you with a username and password or you have registered one with us, it is your responsibility to keep this safe and not disclose it. If you are registering the username and password online we advise you not to use a password you already use on any other website.

If you have changed your email address it is your responsibility to inform us.

We will always ask for additional information to correctly identify your account before we give out any information over the phone.

Third party activities relating to any advertiser you submitted your information to via RecruitIreland.com are beyond our control. We urge you to review the privacy policy of such advertisers to ensure your information is secure once it is transferred to that third party. If you wish to modify any information submitted to an advertiser you must contact them directly as they are responsible for that information.

## Advertisers

We offer the use of a secure server for all online payments. All information is secured by Realex our payment provider. After a transaction is concluded your credit card/debit card details will not be stored on file or in our servers. We will never contact you by email to ask for your credit card details after a transaction has been processed. Please be aware of our [phishing](https://web.archive.org/phishing/) warning.
