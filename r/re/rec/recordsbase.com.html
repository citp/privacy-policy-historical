Both RecordsBase and Archives recognize that you care how information about you is used and shared.

This policy covers how RecordsBase and Archives treat the personal information that is received and/or collected , including information related to your past use of the Website and/or the Members' Website and/or Services. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, credit or debit card number, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control or to people that we do not employ or manage. <br> 
<h2 class="subArticleHeaderTD2">Information Collection and Use</h2>

By submitting your email address on our checkout page you agree that you're opting into our no-cost newsletter and email alerts service. You understand that you will receive messages that are commercial in nature. An opt-out "unsubscribe" link will be provided for your convenience in each message. <br>
We collect information about your transactions with us and with some of our business partners, such as billing partners, including information about your use of search products and information we offer. <br><br>
We automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, our cookie information, search activity, and the pages you request. <br><br>
We use the information for the following general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, publish search data, and provide reporting for internal and external clients. <br>
<h2 class="subArticleHeaderTD2">Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
We do not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances: <br><br>
<ul class="contentList"><li>We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with us.

<li>We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. </li>
<li>We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms and Conditions, or as otherwise required by law. </li>
<li>We transfer information about you if we are acquired by or merged with another company.
