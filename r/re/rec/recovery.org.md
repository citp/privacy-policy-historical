## Cookies and Similar Technologies

We may use cookies to enable the site’s or service providers’ systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.

We use cookies and similar technologies to understand and save your preferences for future visits and compile aggregate data about Site usage and interaction so that we can offer better experiences and tools in the future. We may contract with third-party service providers that use these technologies to assist us in better understanding our Sites’ visitors. They may collect information about your online activities over time, on other devices, and on other websites or apps, if those websites and apps also use the same service provider.

We use Google Analytics, which uses cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of the Site and report on activities and trends.

## Interest Based Advertising

We may partner with ad networks and other ad serving providers (“Advertising Providers”) who serve ads on behalf of us and others on non-affiliated sites. Some of those ads may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on information Advertising Providers collect about your visits to this site and elsewhere over time. Advertising Providers may utilize cookies and similar technologies to make advertising more relevant to you.

You may visit www.aboutads.info to learn more about this type of advertising and how to opt-out of this form of advertising by companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) self-regulatory program. Note that electing to opt-out will not stop advertising from appearing in your browser or applications. It may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests. In addition, note that if you use a different browser or erase cookies from your browser, you may need to renew your opt-out choice.

Please review your web browser “Help” file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. Please note that if you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from the Sites, you may not be able to utilize the features of the Sites to their fullest potential.

## How Do Our Sites Handle Do-Not-Track Signals?

## How Our Helpline Works

For those seeking addiction treatment for themselves or a loved one, the Recovery.org helpline is a private and convenient solution.

**Calls to any general helpline (non-facility specific 1-8XX numbers) for your visit will be answered by American Addiction Centers (AAC).**

We are standing by 24/7 to discuss your treatment options. Our representatives work solely for AAC and will discuss whether an AAC facility may be an option for you.

Our helpline is offered at no cost to you and with no obligation to enter into treatment. Neither Recovery.org nor AAC receives any commission or other fee that is dependent upon which treatment provider a visitor may ultimately choose.

For more information on AAC’s commitment to ethical marketing and treatment practices, or to learn more about how to select a treatment provider, visit our [About AAC](https://web.archive.org/about) page.

If you wish to explore additional treatment options or connect with a specific rehab center, visit [our homepage](https://web.archive.org/) to browse our directory listings, or [SAMHSA’s treatment services locator](https://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/).
