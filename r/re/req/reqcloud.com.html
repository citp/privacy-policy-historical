ReqCloud collects Job Data on clients' behalf when clients request for their Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to be connected to the ReqCloud systems with the purposes of automatically importing job related data. Job information may also be entered into the ReqCloud system manually by clients. Additionally, job applicants may submit job applications in response to jobs posted by ReqCloud clients. "Job Data" means data related to all such job-related imported data, manual job postings, and job applications.<br>
