                          We collect  personal information about you from: </p>
                          <ul>

                            <li>Your        browser, when you visit our website and your browser interacts with us.</li>

                          <p>We may also collect other personal information you provide  us, including information about other people, when you use our website or  related services. Any information you provide about other people is only used  to provide our services.<br>
                          The personal information we collect about you and others through  these sources may include, without limitation:&nbsp; </p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Names, addresses and        telephone numbers.</li>

                          <p><strong>Other Information About You and How We  Collect It</strong><br>
                          Besides obtaining your personal information, we may collect  non-personably identifiable information, including, without limitation, tracking  information such as your browser type, the type of operating system you use,  the name of your Internet service provider, and pages visited on our site. We  obtain this information by using technologies such as cookies.</p>
                        <p><strong>How We Use the  Information<br>
                        </strong>The content of the items you add  to reQall may be accessed by QTech, Inc. employees or our service providers in order  to provide the service (for example, when human transcription is necessary).  Unless you have requested support to resolve a question about your account, any  content that is accessed is handled anonymously, using an account number rather  than any personally identifiable information.</p>
                        <p>We do not disclose your personal  information to any third party for marketing purposes without your  permission.&nbsp; We do use your  non-personally identifiable information to increase the functionality and  user-friendliness of our website, products and services and to better tailor them  to your needs.&nbsp; We also use this  information to monitor onsite activity in the aggregate. &nbsp;For example, we may monitor how long the  average user spends on our site or which pages or features get the most  attention.&nbsp; We reserve the right to  release non-personally identifiable information to our advisors and partners. </p>
                        <p>In addition, to the extent  required by law, we may disclose personally identifiable information to  government authorities, or to third parties pursuant to a subpoena or other  legal process, and we may also use or disclose your information as permitted by  law to protect our rights or the rights of our users.<br>
                          We retain your personal  information only for as long as reasonably required. The length of time  information is retained depends upon the purpose for which the information was  collected.</p>
                        <p><strong>Your Choices</strong><br>
                          Out of respect for your right  to privacy we provide you with an easy means to decline receiving promotional emails  from us. At any time, you may request to discontinue receiving these emails by  sending a blank message with the words "Remove from email list" in  the subject area to <a href="mailto:support@reqall.com">support@reqall.com</a>. After opting out, you may occasionally  still receive important notifications for non-marketing or administrative  purposes (such as notifying you of important site changes or for customer service  purposes).</p>
                        <p><strong>Disclosure to Third  Parties </strong><br>
                          We never rent, sell, trade or give away your information to  third parties.&nbsp; We do not publicly  disseminate your personally identifiable information that you voluntarily  upload to your account (by email, phone or other telecommunications  device).&nbsp; We are not responsible for your  actions that result in such information becoming publicly disseminated.</p>
                        <p><strong>Collection of  Information by Third Parties<br>
                        </strong>We may provide additional links  to resources we think you will find useful. These links will lead you to sites  that are not affiliated with us and may operate under different privacy  practices. You are responsible for reviewing the privacy statements for  such other websites, as we have no control over information that is submitted  to these companies. We cannot guarantee  how these third parties use cookies or whether they place cookies on your  computer that may include your personally identifiable or other information. </p>
                        <p><strong>Security</strong><br>
                          While we institute physical, electronic, and  procedural safeguards to protect your personal information, and we regularly  review our security standards and procedures to protect against unauthorized  access to personal information, we cannot guarantee absolute security due to  the inherent risks associated with transmitting information electronically,  wirelessly, or otherwise over the Internet or other telecommunications methods.  The personal information we collect is stored within databases that we control  directly or through our service providers. Our security measures are consistent  with industry standards to protect your information. However, as no security  system is impenetrable regardless of safeguards, we cannot guarantee the  security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that information you supply  will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us.</p>
                        <p><strong>If Our Relationship  Ends<br>
                        </strong>Our policies and practices  regarding the collection and use of information about former users are the same  as those regarding the collection and use of information about existing users.&nbsp; If you delete your account, we delete your  personally identifiable information, including your email address and phone  number.&nbsp; However, we may continue to have  your information in our backup databases and may maintain aggregate,  non-personally identifiable information about your use of our products and  services. </p>
                        <p><strong>Updates</strong><br>
                          As technology and our services evolve, we may  need to update our Privacy Policy at some point in the future, and if we do so,  we will revise the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy  Policy.&nbsp; By continuing to use our  services after we post any such update, you accept the Privacy Policy as  modified.&nbsp; Please also note that as our  business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. &nbsp;In the event that we sell some or all of our  assets, or our product is acquired by another company, information about you may  be among the transferred assets.&nbsp; It is  possible that we would retain a copy of your user information after such a  transfer.</p>
                        <p>Feel free to send us any  questions or comments you may have via email to <a href="mailto:support@reqall.com">support@reqall.com</a>.</p></td>
