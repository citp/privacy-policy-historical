# Your Privacy Rights | Reynolds and Reynolds

Effective: August 7, 2019

This privacy policy applies to all websites that are specifically identified as belonging to us (“our websites”). It also applies to our websites for our products or consumer technologies. They may also have their own privacy policies, specific to those products or services.

Our websites may link to websites from other companies or organizations. We are not responsible for their privacy practices of those other parties. Also, we are not responsible for the content or operation of their websites.

## How we collect personal information

We collect personal information on this website in the following ways:

### Anonymous information

We regularly track site traffic for administrative purposes. We use this anonymous data for a few things:

  * To ensure smooth site traffic flow.
  * To assess what pages on our sites are visited the most.
  * From what countries or Internet Service Provider [ISP] domains visitors access our site.



Our web servers collect the anonymous information that your browser automatically transmits any time you are on the web.

### Cookies

We use cookies to save information about you when you are visiting our sites. Cookies are text files placed on your computer. They collect standard internet log information and visitor behavior. We use this information to respond to you when you contact us and provide the products or services you request. We also use cookies to help track website traffic and improve our websites.

### Google Analytics

We use Google Analytics to help analyze how our users use the site. Google Analytics uses cookies to store information about your use of the website, including your IP address. That information is sent to Google, where we access it for reports. We use these reports to review visitors’ use of the website.

Google will not associate your IP address with any other data they hold. We only store your IP address with personal information if you submit that information through a form on our site.

We also have implemented the following Google Analytics features based on Display Advertising:

  * Remarketing with Google Analytics
  * Google Display Network Impression Reporting
  * DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration
  * Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting



Third-party vendors, including Google, show our ads across the internet. We use ad-tracking, along with third-party vendors. These use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie). Together, these cookies report if you have seen our ads (ad impressions) and how you have interacted with our ads and ad services. We want this information so we can make sure any of our advertising that you see is relevant to you.

### Facebook Conversion Tracking Pixel

We may from time to time use Facebook Advertising, Facebook Pixel Re-Marketing, and communications. This tool allows us to understand and deliver ads and make them more relevant to you. The collected data remains anonymous and we cannot see the personal data of any individual user.

However, the collected data is saved and processed by Facebook. Facebook may be able to connect the data with your Facebook account and use the data for their own advertising purposes (in accordance with Facebook’s Data Use Policy found under: <https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/>). Facebook has ultimate control of the information gathered through Facebook Advertising, Facebook Pixel Re-Marketing, and communications. You can opt-out of Facebook’s use of cookies and Facebook Pixel Re-Marketing through [settings on your Facebook Account](https://www.facebook.com/help/1221288724572426/?helpref=hc_fnav).
