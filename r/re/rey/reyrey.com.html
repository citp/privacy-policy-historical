                    Websites</div>
                  <strong>Scope of this Privacy Policy</strong> <ul>
                    <li> This Privacy Policy generally applies to Websites that 
                      are specifically identified as belonging to Reynolds (“Reynolds-branded 
                      Websites”), including this corporate Website, <a href="http://www.reyrey.com" class="contentLink">www.reyrey.com</a>. 
                      This Privacy Policy also applies to Reynolds-branded Websites 
                      for particular Reynolds consumer tech-nologies. Please note 
                      that those sites may also post their own privacy policies 
                      to describe information practices specific to their products 
                      and services.</li>
                    <li>We are the industry leader in providing integrated technologies 
                      and services to our business clients—primarily vehicle 
                      retailers and manufacturers. Since this Online Privacy Policy 
                      only applies to information we collect on our own behalf, 
                      it does not apply to information we collect on behalf of 
                      our business clients or from our business clients who utilize 
                      our hosted applications. To learn more about our overall 
                      information practices on behalf of our business clients 
                      and on and off the Web, read about <a href="#consumers" class="contentLink">Reynolds

                      by other companies or organizations. Please be aware that 
                      Reynolds is not responsible for the privacy practices of

                  <p> <strong>Collection and use of data from Reynolds Websites</strong><br>
                    <strong>Anonymous information:</strong> We monitor site traffic 
                    for administrative purposes—for example, to ensure smooth 
                    site traffic flow or to assess what pages on our sites are 
                    visited the most and by visitors from which countries or Internet 
                    Service Provider (ISP) domains. To do this, our Web servers 
                    aggregate the anonymous information that your browser automatically 
                    transmits anytime you are on the Web. We do not use this infor-mation 
                    to attempt to identify you. We may enlist the services of 
                    a third-party Web-statistics service provider, but only under 
                    the condition that the service-provider’s use of this 
                    anonymous data is limited to providing the services we request.</p>
                  <p> <strong>Personally identifiable information:</strong> On 
                    Reynolds-branded Websites, we collect personally identifiable 
                    in-formation only when you choose to provide it to us, such 
                    as when you register to use a particular Reynolds consumer 
                    technology, submit an employment application, or send us a 
                    comment by email. </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>We only use your personally identifiable information to

                      service you request.</li>
                    <li>We use your personally identifiable information to send 
                      you information about other products and services only if 
                      you give us express (“opt-in”) permission to 
                      do so.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p> <strong>Cookies:</strong> The only time we use cookies to 
                    save information about you is when you are visiting a Website 
                    re-lated to a Reynolds consumer technology and you give us 
                    express permission to keep a list of the particular products 
                    or services you are interested in. We only use this information 
                    to respond to you or provide the product or service you requested, 
                    or internally, to help us monitor Website traffic and improve 
                    our Websites.</p>
                  <p> <strong>Disclosures for legal reasons</strong><br>
                    We may disclose individual information to comply with legal 
                    process, such as a subpoena or court order, or to protect 
                    or enforce our legal rights.</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li> If we make any material change to this Privacy Policy, 
                      we will provide at least 30 days advance notice on this

                    <li>If we make any material change to the privacy policy associated 
                      with any Reynolds consumer technology, we will provide 30 
                      days advance notice on this page, on our corporate home 
                      page at <a href="http://www.reyrey.com" class="contentLink">www.reyrey.com</a>, 
                      and on the home page and privacy policy page of the particular 
                      Reynolds consumer technology. </li>
                    <li>If we make any material change to a Reynolds privacy policy, 
                      previously collected information will con-tinue to be governed 
                      by the protections of the privacy policy in effect at the 
                      time the information was col-lected. </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>Changes in ownership</strong><br>
                    Reynolds may decide to sell, buy, merge, or reorganize businesses 
                    to further strategic or business interests. Where a transaction 
                    of this kind involves disclosing personal information to prospective 
                    or actual purchasers, our practice is to seek appropriate 
                    protections consistent with our privacy policy.<br>

                    about Reynolds Information Practices</div>
                  <strong>Reynolds solutions for business clients</strong><br>
                  We are the leading provider of integrated technologies and services 
                  that help our business clients—primarily vehicle retailers 
                  and manufacturers—maintain vehicle and parts inventories, 
                  manage accounting and busi-ness administration, and process 
                  sales and service information. In providing solutions to these 
                  businesses, a critical part of our job is to support our business 
                  clients’ privacy and safeguards objectives. <br> <br> 
                  <strong>Safeguarding data</strong><br>
                  In all aspects of our information practices at Reynolds, online 
                  and off, we are committed to implementing and maintaining safeguards 
                  appropriate to protect the privacy, security, confidentiality, 
                  and integrity of data about individuals. 
                  <p>We often act as a service provider to business clients. When 
                    we receive consumer data from a business client so that we 
                    can provide services to that client, we limit our use of the 
                    data to the purposes for which our business clients provided 
                    the data to us.</p>
                  <p>We use service providers, too. For example, to improve Web 
                    response time, we might arrange for a Reynolds-branded Website 
                    to reside on a server owned by a Web-hosting company. In those 
                    cases, it is our practice to require that the service providers 
                    handle information in a manner consistent with our policies 
                    and the commitments we have made to consumers and our business 
                    clients.
