# Referral Blast - Privacy Policy

We know that you care how information about you and your Web site visitors is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy:

**Is personal information about my Web site visitors or the people they refer publicly used in any way?**

No.  When a visitor clicks on the "Send this site to a friend" button, a pop-up window appears that allows the visitor to enter their name (optional), up to 10 email addresses of people they want to send to the site and a custom message (optional).  Referral Blast never records or 'harvests' this information for its own use, nor sells it to third-parties.

**Referral Blast Usage Notification**

When referrals are submitted using the pop-up window, the Webmaster of the Referral Blast-enabled Web site can choose to receive notifications whenever their Referral Blast service is used and learn the _number_ of referrals that were made.  The Webmaster of the Referral Blast-enabled Web site can enable or disable this feature upon setup or at any time during the course of using Referral Blast.

**How is the personal information I provide for credit card processing used?**

During the order process, personal information such as your name, billing address, and credit card information is requested.  This information is used strictly to process your order or to contact you with regard to the product.  It is in no way disclosed, distributed or sold to third parties.

**How secure is information about me?**

  * We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.
  * We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card number when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing (via SSL encryption).



**Referral Blast Custom**

Referral Blast Custom is custom-tailored for Web sites that want more control over the look-and-feel of Referral Blast pop-up windows and email text and layout.  Referral Blast Custom can be configured to provide the Webmaster of the Referral Blast Custom-enabled site a log of Referral activity derived by their Referral Blast Custom service.  Since Referral Blast Custom is only accessible from Web sites that provide a link to it, it is the responsibility of the individual Web site owner to disclose any privacy information to their visitors regarding their receiving this information if they so choose this functionality.
