Privacy Policy - Your Privacy Rights Last revised: January 07, 2014

 **[Dictionary.com](http://dictionary.com/) LLC** respects your privacy. When you use [Dictionary.com](http://dictionary.com/), [Reference.com](http://reference.com/), [Thesaurus.com](http://thesaurus.com/) or any other online products or websites that we own (our "sites") and mobile applications (our "apps"), we collect information about you and use it to facilitate and improve our services. Information about you may also be shared with other companies. For instance, companies engaged in "targeted" or "behavioral" advertising present ads that might be of interest to you based on information about your online activities. We want to be clear about how information about you may be used and what your privacy options are.

This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, how other companies may use it, and tracking technologies used to collect information. If we make any material changes to our privacy practices, we will post a revised Privacy Policy on this page. If you have any questions, please contact us by sending an email here <http://content.dictionary.com/about/contact> or writing to [Dictionary.com](http://dictionary.com/) LLC, ATTN: Legal Department, 555 12th Street, 5th Floor, Oakland, CA 94607.

You may provide this information directly to us or you may choose to register using your Facebook account in which case you would authorize us to access certain Facebook profile information including your first name, last name, gender, birth date and email address. You may also choose to post content (such as custom flashcards) that you may share with others, through our site or through your Twitter or Facebook account. You do not have to provide any of this information to us. But if you do not provide certain information, you will not be able to use some of the services we offer. If you wish, we will delete your account information; to do so, please log into[Dictionary.com](http://dictionary.com/) using the account you wish to close,then close your acount at <http://app.dictionary.com/users/cancelaccount>.

We use your information to provide and improve our services, customize services for you (such as by remembering your preferences), make special offers (like sweepstakes), better understand our users, diagnose and fix problems, and sell and display ads that may be relevant to you. Email addresses, mobile phone numbers, and credit card information are used only for providing you the services you requested upon creating your account.

**Email Address** : We use your email address only to allow you to log in to your account, send you confirmations (of your registration, purchase, etc.), and to send you messages as part of our services. You may choose to stop receiving these emails by adjusting your email settings at<http://app.dictionary.com/users/settings> or by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of the email. For specific services, you can unsubscribe here: [Word of the Day unsubscribe](http://dictionary.reference.com/help/faq/wordoftheday/#unsubscribe) or [Reference of the Day unsubscribe](http://www.reference.com/thisday/list/). We will also use your email address to respond to your customer service inquiries. If you are under the age of 13, certain messaging and site functionality may be non-existent or limited.

**Credit Card Information** : We use your credit card information only to process your purchases and to detect and prevent fraud.

We share user information with other companies for various reasons. What information we make available to other companies depends on the nature of our relationships with them. We generally require these other companies to keep our users' information confidential.

**Service Providers** : We may share all of the types of information we collect with vendors who provide services (such as voice transcription, email and SMS messaging, and payment processing), conduct surveys, and run sweepstakes on our behalf.

**Advertisers** : Advertisers and advertising networks use tracking technologies to collect information about users' computers or mobile devices and their online activities (for example, web pages visited and searches made) as well as general geographic location and use that information to display targeted ads to users. We sometimes allow these ad companies to collect such information when you use our sites and apps to enable them to display targeted ads to you.

**Analytics Companies** : We allow analytics companies to use tracking technologies to collect information about our users' computers or mobile devices and their online activities. These companies analyze this information to help us understand how our sites and apps are being used. Certain versions of our App have an "Opt out of Tracking" setting, which permits you to opt out of being tracked by third party analytics companies.

**What we don't share** : We do not provide ad companies or analytics companies with your name, address, email address, phone number, or credit card information.

**Aggregated Information** : We may publicly disclose aggregated information about our users, such as the total number of our users and their overall demographics.

**Legal Matters** : We may disclose user information: in response to a legal request, such as a subpoena, court order, or government demand; to investigate or report illegal activity; or to enforce our rights or defend claims. We may also transfer your information to another company in connection with a corporate restructuring, such as a sale, merger or in the event of a bankruptcy proceeding.

We, as well as other companies, use tracking technologies to collect and store data about your computer or mobile device and your activities on our sites and apps.

**Cookies** : When you visit our sites, we place "cookies" (small text files) on your computer to recognize you. We do this to store your preferences and track your use of our sites. Ad companies place cookies on your computer to track your activities across various sites so that they can display targeted ads. Some ad companies and game developers use "flash cookies" for ads and games that use Flash media technology.

Many ad companies are members of the Network Advertising Initiative. NAI members allow users to opt out of being tracked by cookies. To opt out of cookie tracking by NAI members, you may visit <http://www.networkadvertising.org/> and click on the "Consumer Opt-out" button. Companies may also be members of the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") and to opt out of cookie tracking by DAA members, you may visit <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>. Finally, to learn how to remove cookies, you may visit these links: [deleting cookies](http://answers.ask.com/Computers/Networking_and_Security/how_to_delete_cookies_from_computer) and [deleting flash cookies](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/). By using our site and products, you give us explicit consent to place cookies and other tracking technology on your computer or mobile device.

**Pixel tags** : We embed pixel tags (also called web beacons or clear GIFs) on web pages, ads, and emails. These tiny, invisible graphics are used to access cookies and track user activities (such as how many times a page is viewed). We use pixel tags to measure the popularity of our features and services. Ad companies use pixel tags to measure the number of ads displayed and their performance (such as how many people clicked on an ad).

**Mobile Device IDs** : If you're using an app, we use mobile device IDs (the unique identifier assigned to a device by the manufacturer), instead of cookies, to recognize you. We do this to store your preferences and track your use of our apps. Unlike cookies, device IDs cannot be deleted. Ad companies use device IDs to track your use of the app, track the number of ads displayed, measure ad performance and display ads that are more relevant to you. Analytics companies use device IDs to track information about app usage.

Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the NAI “Consumer Opt-out” link and the DAA opt-out link above. However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.
