<b>Referral Blast Privacy Policy</b></font></p>

We do not spam and do not associate ourselves with organizations that support such activity. Referral Blast derives its revenue solely from the sale of its product and service offerings. We understand that our success is dependent upon the success of our clients, and that the trust of our clients and their visitors is one of our most important assets to be protected at all times. This collected third party personal information is used exclusively for the purpose of providing the service of sending this one time email and is stored exclusively for the purpose of measuring the effectiveness of our services.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><u>Agents</u></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">We use a credit card processing company to bill you for any services ordered. This company does not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purpose.</font></p>
