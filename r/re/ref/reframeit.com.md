This Privacy Policy describes Reframe It’s policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of your information. Reframe It receives your information through our various technologies, APIs, services and third-parties ("Services"). When using any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Irrespective of which country that you reside in or create information from, your information may be used by Reframe It in the United States or any other country where Reframe It operates.

If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at [privacy@reframeit.com](mailto:privacy@reframeit.com).

## Information Collection and Use

  * We collect and use your information to provide our Services and improve them over time.



**Information Collected Upon Registration:** When you create or reconfigure a Reframe It account, you provide some personal information, such as your name, username, password, and email address. Some of this information, for example, your username, is listed publicly on our Services, including on your profile page and in search results. Some Services, such as public user profiles, and viewing comments via our frame technology, do not require registration.

**Additional Information:** You may provide us with additional information to make public, such as a short biography or a picture. You may customize your account with certain information so that we can help you find Reframe It users you know. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services or to market to you. You may unsubscribe from these messages by following the instructions contained within the messages or the instructions on our web site. If you email us, we may keep your message, email address and contact information to respond to your request. Providing the additional information described in this section is entirely optional.

**Log Data:** Our servers automatically record information ("Log Data") created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, the referring domain, pages visited, and search terms. Other actions, such as interactions with advertisements, may also be included in Log Data.

**Cookies:** Like many websites, we use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk. Reframe It may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.

**Third Party Services:** Reframe It uses third parties to help understand the use of our Services. These parties collect the information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, including cookies and your IP address.

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

  * We do not disclose your private information except in the limited circumstances described here.



**Your Consent:** We may share or disclose your information with your consent, such as when you use a third party web client to access your Reframe It account.

**Service Providers:** We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us. We may share your personal information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to obligations mirroring the protections of this privacy policy.

**Law and Harm:** We may disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect Reframe It’s rights or property.

**Business Transfers:** In the event that Reframe It is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. The promises in this privacy policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity.

**Non-Private or Non-Personal Information:** We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information, such as your public comments or the number of users who clicked on a particular comment.

## Modifying Your Personal Information

If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with tools to access or modify the personal information you provided to us and associated with your account.

## Our Policy Towards Children

Our Services are not directed to people under 13. If you become aware that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us at [service@reframeit.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20101122081731id_/http%3A//reframeit.com/service@reframeit.com). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we take steps to remove such information and terminate the child's account.

## Changes to this Policy

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make a change to this policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will notify you via the e-mail address associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.

_This Privacy Policy is effective as of February 23, 2010._
