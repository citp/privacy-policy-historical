# Privacy Policy | Reflektive

We are Reflektive, Inc. (" ** _Reflektive_** "). This Privacy Policy describes how we protect your data and respect your privacy. Any questions or concerns with respect to your data or privacy should be directed to [privacy@reflektive.com](mailto:privacy@reflektive.com).

##  1 Applicability of this Privacy Policy 

This Privacy Policy applies to Reflektive's website located at [https://www.reflektive.com](https://www.reflektive.com/) and other Reflektive websites and domains (collectively, the " ** _Websites_** "), Reflektive's online performance management tools and platform, including web and mobile applications (collectively, the " ** _Services_** "), and any other interactions (e.g., customer support inquiries, etc.) you may have with Reflektive. 

This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party applications or technology that integrate with the Services, or any other third party products, services, or businesses (" ** _Third Party Services_** "). While using the Services, you may be directed to a third party website via links or other references, which may take you to that third party website (" ** _Third Party Websites_** "). This Privacy Policy does not apply to you or any other data collected from or provided by you to Third Party Websites. You should review such Third Party Services' or Third Party Websites' privacy policy (and such other terms and conditions) to determine how your data will be used before sharing any Personal Data.

##  2 Notice to End Users 

By visiting the Websites, accessing or using the Services, or interacting with any aspect of our business, you accept the terms of this Privacy Policy and expressly consent to our collection, use, and disclosure of data, including Personal Data, provided to or otherwise received by us for the purposes and in the manner described in this Privacy Policy and the applicable Client Agreement.

A separate agreement governs the delivery, access, and use of the Services (the " ** _Client Agreement_** "), including the processing of any " ** _Client Data_** ," which is defined in the applicable Client Agreement but generally includes all data, files, messages, content, or information that Client and/or Authorized Users transmit, upload, transfer, process, store, or submit on or through the Services. The organization (e.g., your employer or another entity or person) that entered into the Client Agreement (" ** _Client_** ") controls their instance of the Services (their " ** _Workspace_** ") and any associated Client Data. Client, and individuals who have been authorized by Client, who access or use the Services via their Workspace (e.g., Client's employees, managers, and human resources administrators) are " ** _Authorized Users_** ". Your use of the Services may be subject to your Client's (e.g. your employer's) policies, if any. If you have any questions about your specific Workspace settings and privacy practices, please contact the Client whose Workspace you use. Reflektive is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of our Clients, which may differ from those set forth in this Privacy Policy.

##  3 Data We Collect and Receive 

Sometimes you provide us with data and sometimes data about you is collected automatically. To the extent data is associated with an identified or identifiable natural person and is protected as personal data under applicable data protection laws, it is referred to in this Privacy Policy as " ** _Personal Data_**." You acknowledge and agree we may collect, process, store, access, and disclose Personal Data disclosed by you or your Client (e.g., your employer) to facilitate the provision of Services and related support for the Services in the manner described in this Privacy Policy and the applicable Client Agreement.

### 3.1 Client Data

Clients and Authorized Users routinely submit Client Data to Reflektive when using the Services. Client Data is governed by the Client Agreement. Client Data may include Account Information, Hosted Data, Sync Data, or any Client Data otherwise defined in the Client Agreement. If you have any questions about your Personal Data with respect to Client Data, please contact the Client whose Workspace you use.

  * #### Account Information.

To create or update an Authorized User account for the Services, you or your Client (e.g. your employer) provide us with data about you and your employment, such as: 
    * your name 
    * date of birth 
    * job title 
    * work email address 
    * office location 
    * office phone number 
    * your company department or organization 
    * your manager's name 
    * unique identifier 
    * employment dates 
    * profile picture 
    * user name 
    * password
    * any other applicable Personal Data that may identify you individually 
  * #### Hosted Data.

When a Client uses, or Authorized User interacts with, the Services, we may collect, process, and store any data that is created, posted, uploaded, stored, displayed, transmitted, or submitted on or through the Services (collectively, " ** _Hosted Data_** "), as a function of rendering the Services. Hosted Data may contain Personal Data to the extent a Client or Authorized User discloses Personal Data on or through the Services. Reflektive is a passive recipient and takes no active part in collecting or storing Hosted Data. Except to the extent necessary to render the Services or related support for the Services, Reflektive does not purposefully access any Hosted Data. For example, if you submit a review of another Authorized User, the Services passively processes and stores such performance review for the purpose of rendering the Services, and we will only access such information to the extent necessary to provide the Services and related support for the Services. 
  * #### Sync Data.

Reflektive makes tools available to integrate data from Third Party Services used by Client into the Services (" ** _Sync Data_** "). For example, Client may integrate its Workspace with Client's human capital management platform. When the Services are integrated with a Third Party Service for Sync Data, we will receive all data selected by the Client to sync with the Services. Sync Data is imported into the Services as either Account Information, Hosted Data, or such other Client Data. 



### 3.2 Other Information

Reflektive may collect Other Information from Clients and Authorized Users related to their usage of the Services and interactions with Reflektive. Other Information may include Metadata, Log Data, Technical Data, Cookie Data, Third Party Services, and Additional Information Provided to Reflektive. If you have any questions about your Personal Data with respect to Other Information, please contact Reflektive at [privacy@reflektive.com](mailto:privacy@reflektive.com).

  * #### Metadata.

When an Authorized User interacts with the Services, metadata is generated that provides additional context about the Services and the way Authorized Users use the Services (" ** _Metadata_** "). Reflektive collects aggregated Metadata of the Services, so that the resulting data and statistics are not personally identifiable to any individual Authorized User.
  * #### Log Data.

Like most websites and web-based technology services, our servers automatically collect data when you access or use our Websites or the Services and record it in log files (" ** _Log Data_** "). The Log Data may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, Internet service provider (ISP), browser type and settings, information about browser plugins, language preference, default email application, referring/exit websites, operating system, date and time stamp, cookie data, and certain user activities. 
  * #### Technical Data.

Reflektive collects technical data, such as information about devices accessing the Services, including the type of device, device settings, operating system, application software, peripherals, and unique device identifiers (" ** _Technical Data_** "). Reflektive does not collect Personal Data with any Technical Data or relate any Technical Data to any individual Authorized User. 
  * #### Cookie Information.

Reflektive uses cookies and similar technologies in our Websites and Services that help us collect Other Information. The Websites and Services may also include cookies and similar tracking technologies of third parties, which may collect Other Information about you via the Websites and Services. Cookies are small text files sent by us to your computer or mobile device for later retrieval. They are unique to your Authorized User account or your browser. Session-based cookies last only while your browser is open and are automatically deleted when you close your browser. Persistent cookies last until you or your browser delete them or until they expire. We use both session-based and persistent cookies to help with authentication, security, identifying your preferences, analytics, and otherwise monitoring the functionality and performance of the Services. If you do not wish to have cookies placed on your computer or in local storage, you may adjust your web browser settings accordingly. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your browser to block cookies or to alert you when cookies are sent. However, restricting cookies may impede your ability to use the Services or certain features of the Services. 
  * #### Third Party Services.

Clients may choose to permit or restrict integrations with Third Party Services for their Workspace. Once enabled, the enabled Third Party Services may share certain data with Reflektive to effectuate the integration. You should check the privacy settings and notices of these Third Party Services to understand what data may be disclosed to Reflektive. When the Services are integrated with Third Party Services to enhance the Services (e.g., Slack, Jira, Gmail, etc.), we may receive data regarding your credentials for and use of the applicable Third Party Services, such as your user name, your unique identifier, and your information transmitted from or made available with permissions by such Third Party Services ( _e.g.,_ account profile, gender, age range, language, geographic region, etc.). When the Services are integrated with Third Party Services for the login and authentication process (e.g., Google Sign-In, OneLogin, ADFS, and many other SAML 2.0 compatible services) and an Authorized User logs in to the Services using a Third Party Services authenticator, we may receive data regarding your credentials for the applicable Third Party Services, such as your log-in, your user name, your email, your unique identifier, profile picture, and your information transmitted from or made available with permissions by such Third Party Services (e.g. account profile, gender, age range, language, geographic region, etc.).
  * #### Additional Information Provided to Reflektive.

Reflektive receives data when submitted to our Websites or through our Services, or if you contact us (e.g., by email, telephone calls, written correspondence, web based forms, or otherwise), request support, apply for or take a job with us, contract with us, interact with our social media accounts, or otherwise communicate with Reflektive. 



### 3.3 No Sensitive Personal Data

Reflektive does not intentionally collect, process, or store, and we request that you do not post, upload, store, display, transmit, or submit Sensitive Personal Data on or through the Services or in Client Data. " ** _Sensitive Personal Data_** " includes, but is not limited to, government-issued identification numbers; financial account numbers; credit or debit card numbers; consumer reports; background checks; any code or password that could be used to gain access to personal accounts; genetic data or biometric data; any Personal Data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership; or data concerning health or sex life or sexual orientation. Reflektive is not responsible and will not be liable for any loss or damages you or another individual may experience due to your disclosure of Sensitive Personal Data while using the Services. 

### 3.4 No Children's Data

Reflektive's business activities are directed to other businesses and the Services are intended for use only by those who are 18 years of age and over. The Services are not directed to or intended for children, and Reflektive does not intentionally collect, process, or store any Personal Data from any person under 13 years of age. In the event we discover we have inadvertently collected, processed, or stored any Personal Data from a person under 13 years of age, we will promptly take the appropriate steps to delete such data or seek the necessary verifiable parental consent for that collection in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (" ** _COPPA_** ").

## 4 How and Why We Use Data

Client Data will be used by Reflektive in accordance with Client's instructions, including any applicable terms in the Client Agreement and Client's use of Services functionality, and as required by applicable law.

Other Information will be used by Reflektive in furtherance of our legitimate interests in operating our business and providing the Websites and Services, to perform contractual obligations, and/or pursuant to your express consent for a specific purpose.

## 5 How We Share and Disclose Data

For example, an Authorized User's name, job title, and work email address, among other things, may be displayed with their profile accessible to the Client and other Authorized Users in the same Workspace. While in some cases you can make certain data private to specific users, by default most data is public to other Authorized Users in the same Workspace.

Reflektive is not responsible and will not be liable for the data disclosed on the Services.
  * #### Rendering the Services.

Reflektive employees and contractors may have access to your data on a need to know and confidential basis to the extent necessary to render the Services and related support for the Services.
  * #### Third Party Service Providers.

Reflektive engages third parties to process data in support of delivering of the Services (" ** _Third Party Service Providers_** "). Reflektive may share your data, including Personal Data, with Third Party Service Providers (e.g., email services, platform hosting, cloud computing services, data storage and processing facilities) to the limited extent necessary to let them perform business functions and services for us or on our behalf in connection with the provision of the Services; provided that such Third Party Service Providers process data in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy and applicable data protection laws and will not use or disclose Personal Data for any other purpose.

You should check the privacy settings and notices of these Third Party Services to understand their privacy practices.
  * #### Changes to Reflektive's Business.

If Reflektive engages in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, sale of some or all of its assets or stock, financing, public offering of securities, acquisition of all or a portion of our business, a similar transaction or proceeding, or steps in contemplation of such activities (e.g. due diligence), Reflektive may share or disclose data in connection therewith, subject to standard confidentiality obligations.
  * #### Aggregated or De-identified Data.

If any data is aggregated or de-identified so it is no longer reasonably associated with an identified or identifiable natural person, we may use or disclose such aggregated or de-identified data for any purpose.

## 8 Identifying the Data Controller and Data Processor

Data protection laws in certain jurisdictions differentiate between the "controller" and "processor" of data. In general, Client is the controller of Client Data. In general, Reflektive is the processor of Client Data and the controller of Other Information. 

## 9 International Data Transfers

Reflektive primarily processes and stores data in connection with the Services in the United States. However, the Services are global and all data, including Personal Data, may be processed and stored in any country where we have operations or where we engage Third Party Service Providers. We may transfer data, including Personal Data, to countries outside of your country of residence, which may have data protection laws that are different from those of your country. We will take measures to ensure that your Personal Data remains protected to the standards described in this Privacy Policy and any such transfers comply with applicable data protection laws. In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other countries may be entitled to access your Personal Data.

### 9.1 EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks

To comply with European Union and Swiss data protection laws, Reflektive self-certified under the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks (" ** _Privacy Shield_** ") as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data transferred from the European Union member countries and Switzerland to the United States. Reflektive adheres to the Privacy Shield principles of: notice; choice; accountability for onward transfer; security; data integrity and purpose limitation; access; and recourse, enforcement, and liability. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield principles, the Privacy Shield principles shall govern with respect to Personal Data transferred from the European Union member countries and Switzerland to the United States. Reflektive is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). To view our certification, see Reflektive's [Privacy Shield Notice](https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000L1FfAAK&status=Active). To learn more about Privacy Shield, please visit [www.privacyshield.gov](https://www.privacyshield.gov/).

Reflektive commits to investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and disputes regarding our collection, use, or disclosure of Personal Data in compliance with Privacy Shield. European Union and Swiss individuals with questions or complaints regarding the collection, use, or disclosure of their Personal Data or this Privacy Policy should first contact Reflektive at the contact information provided below. Reflektive will respond to any such inquiries or complaints within forty-five (45) days.

Reflektive has further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield-related complaints to JAMS, an independent dispute resolution provider located in the United States. If you do not receive a timely acknowledgement of your Privacy Shield-related complaint from Reflektive, or if we have not satisfactorily resolved your complaint or addressed your concern, please contact JAMS to file your complaint, at no cost to you. To contact JAMS and/or learn more about JAMS dispute resolution services, including instructions for submitting a complaint, please visit: <https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield>. Under certain limited situations, as a last resort, you may seek redress from the Privacy Shield Panel, a binding arbitration mechanism. 

Human resources data including Personal Data in the context of the employment relationship is subject to internal human resource policies. Reflektive commits to cooperate with the panel established by the European Union data protection authorities (DPAs) and/or the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner, and comply with the advice given by such authorities with regard to human resources data transferred from the European Union member states and Switzerland to the United States in the context of an employment relationship as set forth in the Privacy Shield principles.

### 9.2 Standard Contractual Clauses

The transfer of Personal Data from the European Union member countries and Switzerland to the United States will be subject to Privacy Shield and then, if Privacy Shield is deemed to be inadequate by European Union and/or Swiss data protection laws, will be subject to the Standard Contractual Clauses for the transfer of Personal Data to Processors (" ** _Standard Contractual Clauses_** "). The Standard Contractual Clauses will also apply to the transfer of Personal Data from the European Union member countries and Switzerland to any country deemed by applicable data protection laws not to ensure an adequate level of data protection.

  * #### Right to Data Portability.

You may have the right to be provided with your Personal Data in a structured, machine readable and commonly used format and to request that we transfer the data to another data controller without effecting the usability of the data.
