To help us provide superior service, your personal information may be shared with legal entities within our corporate group globally as well as our third party service providers who will take steps to safeguard it in accordance with our privacy policy. 

There are also times when it may be advantageous for Reflected to make certain personal information about you available to companies that Reflected has a strategic relationship with or that perform work for Reflected to provide products and services to you on our behalf.

Reflected may take the personal information we receive from individuals responding to our customer surveys or other information gathering efforts in connection with our customer support, online portals and other services and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses of other customers we may have, to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions or otherwise use such information to improve the quality of its services to our customer, and to modify or develop new services and products.

We also reserve the right to disclose your personal information for any reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including credit agencies, collection agencies, merchant database agencies, law enforcement, litigation or to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Child Online Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental or legal requests for such information. We may also disclose personal information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our contracts, policies and procedures. Finally we may also disclose information about you if we determine that for national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary.
