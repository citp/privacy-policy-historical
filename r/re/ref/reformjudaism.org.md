We may use cookies, HTML tracking information, or other technologies to collect certain information about visitors to our Site and interactions with our emails and online advertisements, and to allow URJ to keep track of analytics and certain statistical information which enables URJ to improve its Site and provide you with more relevant content and advertising on our Site and other sites.

For example, we may automatically collect certain non-personal information from you, including but not limited to your browser type, device type, operating system, unique device identifier of any of your computer(s) or device(s) that are used to access the Site, software version, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, geolocation, phone model, phone operating system, and the domain name from which you accessed the Services.
