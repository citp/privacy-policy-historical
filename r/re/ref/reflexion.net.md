# Reflexion Networks - Privacy Statement -

## Privacy Statement

Reflexion Networks, Inc. (Reflexion) recognizes and respects your right to privacy. As outlined in this statement, our policy is to take all reasonable steps to protect your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure, misuse of any kind, and loss. 

As a user of Reflexion Total Control™, you are not required to reveal any personal information other than your name and email address. The Reflexion server, by the nature of the application and its security model, keeps a database recording the “From” and “To” addresses for every email message that you send or receive, along with other message details (but not the message body), and also tracks the history of your message traffic for use in the Reflexion reports package. The system also tracks basic network configuration information provided by the email administrator for account set-up, including details of the network firewall, Mail Transport Agents, and IP addresses. 

Reflexion does not store email messages, unless specifically directed to do so by your email administrator through the User Options screen. If so directed, the Reflexion server will only keep a copy of blocked messages until they are deleted in accordance with the schedule specified by your email administrator. 

Reflexion protects all of the information provided to it or to the Reflexion Total Control™ email server or Administration Web site by making it accessible only with the use of a valid user name and password.

The information that you provide is available to Reflexion experts only as necessary to provide site maintenance, customer technical support, or other customer-specific supporting activities, such as deployment assistance and training. In all cases, the information that you have provided will not be shared with anyone outside of RNS in any way without your prior written consent, except when required (i) to do so by law or law enforcement authorities, (ii) to comply with legal proceedings, or (iii) to protect the property or interests of RNS. 

The Reflexion Web site contains links to third party Web sites that provide information that you may find useful. Reflexion is not responsible for the privacy policies of those Web sites, or for your dissemination or use of any information provided by such sites. 

The Reflexion Administration Web site uses a “cookie” to individualize and improve your experience with the site. A cookie is a small file of information that the Reflexion server stores on your computer's hard drive. You can choose not to accept cookies by changing the settings of your browser. 

Reflexion reserves the right to change this Privacy Statement at its own discretion. You indicate your acceptance of the Reflexion Privacy Policy by providing any requested information and continuing to use the Reflexion Web site. 

If you have any questions or comments about this policy, please contact us at [privacy@reflexion.net](mailto:privacy.207-241-228-173-S554822@reflexion.net). We would value your input.
