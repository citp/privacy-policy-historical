# Hosted Email Services | Reflexion Networks | Privacy Statement

### Reflexion Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is effective as of June 1, 2012

Reflexion Networks, Inc. (“Reflexion”) recognizes and respects your right to privacy. We are very concerned with safeguarding your information, and employ administrative, physical, procedural and technological measures that are designed to protect your information from unauthorized access. As outlined in the following statement, our policy is to take all reasonable steps to protect your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure, misuse of any kind, and loss.

Reflexion sells its email security and compliance services (“Services”) through a global network of IT Solution Providers (“Resellers”), which typically deploy and manage the Services for their end-user customers (“Customers”). Each Reseller has signed an agreement with Reflexion that includes mutual confidentiality provisions, and we recommend that each Customer also have a mutual non-disclosure agreement in place with its Reseller governing the handling of personal and confidential information.

If you are a Reseller, Reflexion collects basic information, including name, email address, physical address, and other information about your firm that enables us to profile the firms in our global distribution network. We also use this information to communicate with you for purposes such as product and sales training, technical support, and sales promotions, among other things. We also collect information about your Customers and their end-users (“Users”), including their names and email addresses, in order to provide technical support and to ensure that we invoice you accurately for the Services to which your Customers have subscribed. We do not share your information, or your Customers’ and Users’ information with anyone outside the company, other than parties that may be directly involved in the delivery of the Services, such as contractors or technology partners. In no case does Reflexion use Customer information for marketing purposes, unless it has received explicit written approval.

Also, if you are a Reseller, Reflexion collects and retains financial and billing information, which we store in our financial software, where your information is encrypted. You may choose to provide us with a credit card number for monthly billing, and this information is also encrypted in our financial software.

If you are a Customer or a User of the Services, you are not required to reveal any personal information other than your name and email address. In the delivery of specific Services, Reflexion collects additional information as required to provide the Service effectively, to provide technical support, and to create accurate invoices for the Services.

For example, Reflexion Total Control™ (RTC), by the nature of the application and its security model, keeps a database recording the “From” and “To” addresses for every email message that a User sends or receives, along with other message details (but not the message body), and also tracks the history of the User’s message traffic for use in generating reports and for troubleshooting technical issues. The system also tracks basic network configuration information provided by the Reseller or the Customer’s email administrator during Customer account set-up, including details of the network firewall, Mail Transport Agents, and IP addresses. RTC does not store email messages, unless specifically directed to do so by the Reseller or the Customer’s email administrator for diagnostic purposes, or in the event that the Customer’s on-premises email server ceases to operate, in which case Reflexion will queue email messages until the local email server resumes operation, at which time every queued message will be delivered. If so directed by the Reseller or the Customer’s email administrator, RTC will also keep a copy of all blocked messages in a quarantine folder on the Reflexion services management web site (“Portal”), until they expire.

In the delivery of the Reflexion Archiving, Discovery and Recovery Service (“RADAR”), by the nature of the application, Reflexion stores all Customer email in a dynamic, persistent, encrypted repository (“Archive”) in accordance with each Customer’s retention policy, which may be indefinitely. Reflexion also offers an email continuity service (“RADAR Lite”), which stores all Customer email in a dynamic, encrypted repository for a rolling sixty (60) day period, with email older than 60 days automatically deleted. Access to Users’ archived email is only available to the User who has Archiving activated; access to the enterprise Archive is provided by default to the Postmaster address, which can be reassigned by the Solution Provider or the Enterprise Administrator to another party. At no time does Reflexion have access to the Archived email without the login credentials of the Customer, as provided by the Solution Provider or the Enterprise Administrator. Upon termination of the RADAR or RADAR Lite service by the Customer, or the Solution Provider on behalf of the Customer, the Customer may retrieve its Archive in one of several ways. First, RADAR provides an “Email Recovery” feature to download the archive through the user interface. However, this approach may not be practical for a large archive, and Customers frequently request the capability to export the Archive in raw format as .eml files, using another option. Second, Reflexion provides for the FTP upload of the Archive as .eml files within a ZIP file. Third, Reflexion provides an option to have the User’s Archive transferred to a WORM drive as .eml files within a ZIP file for shipment to the Customer. The second and third options incur a service charge from Reflexion. Upon termination of RADAR or RADAR Lite, Reflexion will maintain the Customer’s existing archive for thirty (30) days, after which the archive will be permanently deleted. Reflexion protects all of the information provided to it, to the servers utilized in the delivery of the Services, and to the Portal by making it accessible only with the use of a valid user name and password.

The information that is provided is available to Reflexion experts only as necessary to provide site maintenance, customer technical support, or other customer-specific supporting activities, such as deployment assistance and training. In all cases, the information that is provided will not be shared with anyone outside of Reflexion in any way without the Reseller’s or Customer’s prior written consent, except when required (i) to do so by law or law enforcement authorities, (ii) to comply with legal proceedings, or (iii) to protect the property or interests of Reflexion. The Reflexion Portal contains links to third party Web sites that provide information that Resellers, Customers and Users may find useful. Reflexion is not responsible for the privacy policies of those Web sites, or for the dissemination or use of any information provided to or by such sites.

The Reflexion Portal uses a “cookie” to individualize and improve the User’s experience with the site. A cookie is a small file of information that the Reflexion server stores on your computer's hard drive. You can choose not to accept cookies by changing the settings of your browser.

Reflexion’s Services and Portal are for business use and are not directed to children under 18. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personal or contact information without their consent, the parent or guardian should contact us at [privacy@reflexion.net](mailto:privacy@reflexion.net). If Reflexion becomes aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete such information from our files immediately.

Reflexion reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time and at its own discretion, so please review the policy frequently. You indicate your acceptance of the Reflexion Privacy Policy by providing any requested information and continuing to use the Services and Portal. If Reflexion changes its privacy policy, it will post those changes to this privacy statement, so that Resellers, Customers and Users are aware of the information that we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances and for which purposes, if any, we disclose it. If you have any questions or comments about this policy, please contact us at [privacy@reflexion.net](mailto:privacy@reflexion.net). We would value your input.
