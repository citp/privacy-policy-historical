# R29's Privacy Policy - Your Information Is Protected on Refinery29

Last updated October 1st, 2015

Refinery 29 Limited registered in England and Wales under company number 08279936 and with registered office at 10 John Street, London, WC1N 2EB, United Kingdom (“Refinery29” or “we”) takes your privacy extremely seriously. This privacy policy describes how we treat and use the information we collect when you visit or use our web site Refinery29.uk, mobile-optimized versions of the web site, or software applications to which this policy is linked (collectively, “Website”), including when you sign-up for our newsletters.

### Collection of Information

**Children.** We do not offer the Website to anyone under the age 18 and do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. No one under age 13 may provide any information to or on the Website. If you are under 13, do not use or provide any personal information on or through the Website, register on the Website, or use any of the interactive or public comment features of this Website or provide any information about yourself to us, including your name, email address or any screen name or user name you may use.

**Information You Provide.** We generally collect personally identifiable information that you voluntarily provide. For instance, information may be collected when you: sign up for our newsletters, create an account/register on our Website, complete a survey, post a comment to an article on our Website, enter a sweepstakes or contest, or participate in our social networking features. Further, you may be asked to provide your email address, your name, buying preferences, annual income (by accepting to participate in surveys), or other demographic or profile information (by accepting to participate in surveys), Twitter or Facebook usernames or other usernames and aliases used for purposes of linking to and/or posting on your social media accounts, and other information you choose to submit. We will collect such information as well as any other content that you provide to us in engaging in any of the above activities or any other activities on the Website. Additionally, if you elect to post material to any blogs, forums, or participate in our community boards that may be offered on our Website, then such materials will be collected and may be publicly available for others to view. Even after you terminate your account, all such materials submitted by you on the Website or our social media channels may be retained by us and we may continue to disclose such materials publicly.

**Other Information We Collect.** Subject to your consent, we and other parties may also collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or other online services (behavioral tracking), such as pages visited and how often and for how long they are visited. We may use various technologies and features to collect this information, such as tracking your activities through your Internet Protocol (IP) address, computer settings or most-recently visited URL, as well as through the use of “cookies” and “web beacons” described in our Cookies Policy. 

**Do-Not-Track Signals.** Because there is not yet a consensus on how companies should respond to web browser-based or other “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) mechanisms, we currently do not respond to web browser DNT signals that provide a method to opt out of the collection of information about online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. We may revisit our policy on responding to these signals, in which case we will post a revised privacy policy on this site. See “Modifications” below.

Please see our Cookies Policy for further information on our use of cookies, web beacons and similar technologies. 

**Location Information.** We may, and may enable our advertisers to, collect your location via certain services we provide through digital applications, wireless access protocol services ("WAP Services") or mobile phone services. We, or the service provider, will inform you of such collection at the time you use the service and will obtain your prior consent to the extent required by applicable law. 

**General Usage Information.** In addition, we may gather aggregate usage information about Website users on an anonymous basis. This information is not personally identifiable and will be used to determine how our Website is being used. Examples of such information include: How much time do users spend on our site? What pages do they view? What sites did they come from? What sites do they go to? All of this information is collected to help us create a better, faster, more efficient website and to provide you with better content. We may also share aggregate usage information, in aggregate anonymous form, with our prospective and actual business partners, advertisers and other third parties for any business purpose.
