# Privacy Policy – Reolink

Last updated on June 6, 2019.

Your privacy is important to Reolink. We've developed this Privacy Policy that covers what information we collect, how we collect it, how we use it and what choices you have about it.

Some of the concepts might seem a little technical, and we've tried our best to explain them in a simple and clear way. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices and [let us know](https://web.archive.org/contact-us/) if you have any questions.

This Privacy Policy governs your use of Reolink official website [https://reolink.com/](https://web.archive.org/), including Reolink subdomain sites around the world (collectively, "Site"), and it also applies to the security products we sell, the official software we offer (Reolink App and Client specifically), as well as all other services Reolink provides, including, but not limited to Reolink Cloud and technical support (collectively, "Products and Services").

BY USING REOLINK SECURITY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, YOU CONSENT TO THE DATA PRACTICES PRESCRIBED IN THIS STATEMENT.

* ## What Information We Collect

We collect the following information when you visit our Site or using our Products and Services:

### 1\. Personal Information

1). **Contact information.** When you register a Reolink account, contact us via email, or register Reolink products you bought, we might collect that information such as your name, email address and phone number.

2). **Payment information.** We might collect information necessary to complete your purchase such as credit card number and mailing address, and any other information you choose to provide to us when making a purchase.

3). **Information you share or post on our website.** We might collect information that you post in a public space on our website, such as the Community (we also call it Forum).

4). **Social media information.** If you access our websites using your Facebook/Google account login, we may receive personal information about you such as your name, email address, and gender. Any personal information that we collect from your Facebook/Google account may depend on your Facebook/Google account's privacy settings.

5). **Third party personal information.** If you choose to provide us with a third party's personal information (such as name, email, and phone number), you must ensure that you have the third party's permission to do so. Examples include providing us with the names and images that you associate with account users or forwarding reference or marketing material to a friend.

### 2\. Device Information

1). **Device setup information.** We collect information related to the setup and usage of Reolink products, such as device name, model, UID, and adjustments you make to the product setup.

2). **Technical information about the device** such as firmware and software version, WiFi signal strength and environmental data from Reolink’s sensors like ambient light in the room.

3). **Video and audio.** Reolink Products enables you to determine the purpose and the means for which you collect video and audio signals data. When you enable the recording or streaming features of your camera, we may record and process video and/or audio recordings from the device, subject to your instruction, configuration and settings. This may include capturing and emailing to you portions of this data as part of a notification or analyzing the data to identify motion or other events. If you subscribe to Reolink Cloud, we will capture, process and retain video and audio data from your device for the duration of your recording subscription period (for example, 7, 30 or 60 days) and you will be able to access those recordings using the Services during that time.

4). **Information about your mobile device,** such as mobile device ID, device model and operating system, to enable Reolink App/Client to function properly.

5). **Information from interaction with Third Parties.** If Reolink offers any product or account connections or integrations with third-party products, applications, functionality, or services (collectively, "Third-Party Products and Services"), and you choose to enable or connect to such Third-Party Products and Services through the means authorized and directed by Reolink and/or such third-party partners, you acknowledge and agree that we may share certain information about your Reolink Product with such third parties for account authentication and management, and to enable the activation, connection and integration with and to such Third-Party Products and Services on such third parties’ platforms. For example, some of our Products use third-party voice assistance services like Google Assistant, which collects information including your Product name to display it on Google-enabled devices.

In some cases, Reolink or the Third-Party partner will instead (or also) ask for permission to control the Reolink products and services and/or third-party products and Services that you have activated and connected to. Your consent is required to allow any of these exchanges or requests for control and you will be able to revoke or disable it at any time.

We may also receive information such as connected monitor model from Google and other third-party partners and combine that with the information in your Reolink account to determine eligibility and efficacy of our programs.

Any Reolink data that you choose to share with a third party, either directly or by or on behalf of Reolink through the authorizations, integrations and connections, is governed by that third party’s privacy policy while in that party’s possession.

Any data that Reolink receives from third parties will be processed and stored by Reolink and will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This information may be processed in the same ways as any other data.

* ## Data Security

Reolink takes precautions, including administrative, technical, and physical measures, to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

The online services offered by Reolink use encryption on web pages where personal information is collected (for example, credit card and other payment information). To use these services, we recommend you use an SSL-enabled browser such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, or Safari. Doing so protects the confidentiality of your personal information while it's transmitted over the Internet.

When we transfer your Personal Information to other countries, we will protect that information as described in this Privacy Policy or as disclosed to you at the time of data collection.

When personal data is transferred from the European Economic Area (EEA), we take special safeguards to ensure that the protection travels with the data, including having standard clauses approved by the European Commission in our contracts with parties that receive information outside the EEA.

The privacy protections and the rights of authorities to access your information in these countries may not be the same as in your home country. And we may not provide the same level of protection as those in your country.
