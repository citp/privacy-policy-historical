# Privacy Policy – Reolink

Last updated on June 19, 2018.

Your privacy is important to Reolink. We've developed this Privacy Policy that covers what information we collect, how we collect it, how we use it and what choices you have about it.

Some of the concepts might seem a little technical, and we've tried our best to explain them in a simple and clear way. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices and [let us know](https://web.archive.org/contact-us/) if you have any questions.

This Privacy Policy governs your use of Reolink official website [https://reolink.com/](https://web.archive.org/), including Reolink subdomain sites around the world (collectively, "Site"), and it also applies to the security products we sell, the official software we offer (Reolink App and Client specifically), as well as all other services Reolink provides, including, but not limited to Reolink Cloud (collectively, "products and service").

BY USING REOLINK SECURITY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, YOU CONSENT TO THE DATA PRACTICES PRESCRIBED IN THIS STATEMENT.
