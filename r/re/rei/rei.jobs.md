## Use of Information

We use the information we collect about you for a variety of purposes, for example, to:

  * administer your membership and communicate with you about member benefits (such as your dividend balance and special offers only available to members);

  * process and deliver contest or sweepstakes entries and prizes.



We may store and process information in the United States and other countries.

## Sharing of Information

We may share personal information about you outside of REI and its affiliates, including as follows:

  * with third parties who complete transactions or perform services on our behalf;
  * we may make our postal mailing list and general shopping information available to selected companies we believe may offer products or services of interest to you;

  * in connection with, or during negotiations of, a corporate business transaction, such as a merger or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company, joint venture, corporate reorganization, insolvency or bankruptcy, financing or sale of company assets;
  * if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request; to enforce our agreements, policies, and terms of use; and to protect REI, our members, our customers, or any other person from harm; and
  * with your consent.



We may also share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information about you.

## Social Sharing Features  


The Services may offer social sharing features or other integrated tools, which let you share actions you take on the Services with other media, and vice versa.  The use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the third party that provides the social sharing feature.  For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the third parties that provide these features.

## Security

REI takes reasonable measures, including administrative, technical, and physical safeguards, to protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

## Your Choices

**Your Information.** You may update or correct information about you by logging into your online account or calling Customer Service. You may also email us if you wish to deactivate your account, but note that we may retain information about you for legitimate business purposes or as required by law.

**Promotional Communications.** You may opt out of receiving promotional emails and text messages from REI by following the instructions in those communications or changing your preferences via <http://www.rei.com/help/mailing.html>. If you opt out of receiving promotional communications, we may still send you non-promotional emails, such as emails about your purchases, account, membership or our ongoing business relations.

**Location Information.** You also have the ability to turn location-based services on and off by adjusting the settings of your Internet browser or mobile device, or by following the standard uninstall process and removing all REI applications from your mobile device.

## **Third Party Advertising, Analytics and Services**

We allow third parties to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet and to provide analytics services. These third parties may use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and other websites, including your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked, and conversion information. This information may be used by REI and these third parties to analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our Services and other websites, and better understand your online activity. This Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, third party cookies, web beacons, or other tracking technologies and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of these third parties to learn more about their privacy practices. For more information about Internet-based ads, or to opt out of having your web browsing information used in this way, please visit [www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) or [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices).

We also use a third party to "power" product reviews on our Services. When you submit a product review, you become subject to the terms of use and privacy policy of this third party, and the reviews you submit may be posted on our Services and on third party websites.

## **Your California Privacy Rights**

California law permits residents of California to request certain details about how their information is shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes. However, under the law, a business is not required to provide this information if it permits California residents to opt in to, or opt out of, this type of sharing. REI qualifies for this alternative option. To opt out of having your information shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes, please _call Customer Service_.

## Changes to this Policy

REI may change this Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the Effective Date above and, in some cases we may provide you with more prominent notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you an email notification). We encourage you to review the Policy to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.
