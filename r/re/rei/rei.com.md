## We Protect Your Privacy

We respect the privacy of our customers. This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand what information we gather and how we use it. In our ongoing effort to improve the products, services and features we provide to our customers, REI will continue to implement new technologies from time to time. As a result, this policy is subject to change without prior notice and we will post any revision on this web site. We encourage you to review our privacy policy periodically. When you do business with us or use our website, you accept this Privacy Policy. 

## Personal Information

Personal information is information about a specific person, including the person's name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card number, birth date, information about the person's activities and purchases, and, if applicable, member number. 

## The Information We Gather

When you become an REI member, and whenever you purchase products from REI, become a registered shopper, participate in our gift registry or request a catalog, we collect and store your personal and transactional information in our customer database. This information is generally used to process your transactions, respond to your requests, and, if you are a member, calculate your member dividend. You may also receive periodic printed or e-mail communications from us about new products and services, discounts, special promotions or upcoming events. 

## Aggregate Data and Information Usage

In addition to personal information, we collect and store information about the products purchased by channel and the pages viewed by all of our website visitors. We then use this data in aggregate form to identify overall customer behavior patterns. Our goal in using this information is to improve your experience at REI by being more responsive to the needs and preferences of our customers. 

Our Web servers automatically collect information about each visitor who requests REI Web pages, including your computer's internet protocol (IP) address. This IP address allows us to identify your computer on the internet so that the Web content you request from us can be sent to you. 

We provide portions of this aggregate site behavior information to vendors, consultants, potential advertisers or news agencies. We typically do this in order to demonstrate the amount of interest in REI and to plan for product and service improvements. 

## Voluntary Registered Shopper Information

Your REI Online Account is an optional service provided on REI's websites. You do not have to register for Your REI Online Account in order to shop online with us. However, registering allows us to speed up the shopping process for you and lets us offer you access to special features and promotions. [Learn more about REI Online Accounts.](http://www.rei.com/online/store/YourAccountInfoOutView?storeId=8000&langId=-1&catalogId=40000008000) Please note that this is not the same as an REI membership. [Click here](https://web.archive.org/shared/help/membership_join.html?storeId=8000) for information on REI Membership. 

## Click-Stream Data (and Cookie Technology)

We use this information to process your order and to make sure that it is delivered to you. Aggregated order information is also used to track and analyze overall shopping trends, which allows REI to improve product offerings and services to its members and customers. 

In order to register on—or purchase products from—REI's websites, your browser must be set to accept "cookies." A cookie is a small piece of data housed in a text file or folder on your computer's hard drive that helps us recognize you when you visit our sites. We use cookies to help us remember things such as the following: (1) the profile facts you tell us about yourself, (2) your specified areas of interest on our sites, (3) the items you've placed in your shopping basket, and/or (4) the pages you visit as you shop. 

**The only personal information our cookie can contain is information that you supply yourself.** Our cookies cannot read data from other parts of your computer. 

Click-stream data is information that describes the page-by-page paths you take as you browse through our websites. REI partners with Coremetrics, a service provider, to help us gather and analyze information about your browsing or purchase behavior on our website. The role of Coremetrics is to help us conduct our business and deliver the most relevant products and services to our customers. We may use click-stream data in the aggregate to provide improved services to groups of shoppers who behave similarly. We may also use this data on an individual basis to improve your specific shopping experience. For example, if during a visit to REI.com you read an online article about how to choose the right tent, we may during a subsequent visit present you with a how-to article on cleaning your tent or point you to a new product related to tent repair. 

If you would like to opt-out of having your personal information available to Coremetrics, or if you would like to view or change your current Opt-out status, please [click here](https://web.archive.org/shared/help/opt_out.html?storeId=8000). 

## Subscription Preferences

When you provide REI with your email address you will receive REI's email newsletters. You may choose at any time to discontinue receiving REI newsletters by opting out or unsubscribing. 

We often state that **"REI will not share your e-mail address."** That statement is our promise to you that we will not rent, sell, or give your e-mail address to any other organization for the purposes of marketing or solicitation. 

However, in order to deliver our e-mail newsletters REI will need to supply your e-mail address to specific service providers who deliver e-mail on our behalf. We also use service providers to authenticate and validate the information provided by our customers to help assure that our e-mail is successfully delivered. **We have legally binding agreements with these third-party service providers that prohibit them from using your information for any purpose other than in accordance with the terms of their agreements with REI. Therefore, if you sign up for REI's e-mail newsletters, you should not receive unsolicited e-mails from other companies as a result of the release of your information by REI.**

A second statement we make is **"You can opt-out at any time."** This statement is our promise to you that we will respect a decision to stop receiving REI e-mail newsletters. Every e-mail you receive from REI will include a link that allows you to quickly and easily unsubscribe from any or all REI e-mail newsletters. Alternatively, you may [click here](http://preferences.rei.com/rei/rei_PrefCtr.asp) to unsubscribe or to update your e-mail newsletter preferences. 

Please note: In order to process your purchases, we may still send you a confirmation e-mail, or we may contact you by mail or telephone if we have questions about your order. 

## Communications from REI and Other Companies

In some instances, we use third-party companies to help us provide products and services to you, to assist us in market research, managing customer information, or to fulfill promotions and communicate with you. Some of these companies are given access to some or all of the information you provide to us. These companies are contractually restricted from using your information in any manner other than in helping us to provide you with the products and services available from REI. 

REI has partnered with WeddingChannel.com to provide our customers with the ability to aggregate wedding or commitment ceremony registries with multiple retailers. If you participate in REI's Gift Registry program for purposes of a wedding or commitment ceremony, you will be given the ability to "opt-in" to WeddingChannel.com during your registration process. If you choose to "opt-in" to WeddingChannel.com, REI will share the following items of your personally identifiable information to WeddingChannel.com: name, co-registrant's name, email address, mailing address, event type, event date, and registry ID. You may be asked to provide additional personally identifiable information to WeddingChannel.com. Once you "opt-in" to WeddingChannel.com, the information shared by REI as well as any other information you provide directly, is subject to the WeddingChannel.com privacy policy (http://wedding.weddingchannel.com/help/privacy_policy.asp). We encourage you to read the WeddingChannel.com privacy policy to understand the types of information collected and how that information is used by WeddingChannel.com. 

In addition to the REI mailings above, we make available customer names and postal addresses (not your e-mail address or phone number), in combination with transactional data to other select companies. If you do not want us to share this information with these companies, we can add your name to our "do-not-share" list. Please [click here](https://www.rei.com/shared/help/mailing.html?storeId=8000) for information. 

**If you want to be removed from all REI marketing, choose one of the following options: visit our Contact Us page to send an e-mail; call 1-800-426-4840 (US and Canada) or 1-253-891-2500 (outside the US and Canada); or send your request by mail to REI Membership Services, Sumner, WA 98352-0001. Remember to include your name, address, membership number (if applicable) and phone number in the request.**

## Other REI Privacy Notes

  * Links to or From Other Sites—REI may provide links to websites outside of REI.com as an added convenience to the user. There are also affiliates that link to REI.com. Any link included does not imply or convey endorsement of the other company or organization, its site, or its products or services. REI is not responsible for the privacy, terms of use, or other policies of any other website. 

  * REI's Children's Policy—Except for membership data applicable to children, we do not intend to collect any personally identifiable information from children through our websites. Please do not allow children under the age of 18 to provide any personally identifiable information or participate in the bulletin board sections of REI's websites. If you have concerns about a member under the age of 18 receiving mail from companies other than REI, you can add the member's name to our "do not share" list. Please click here for information. 

  * Protection of REI and Others—We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, or protect the rights, property, or safety of REI, our users, or others. 




## Privacy Policy Changes

This Privacy Policy replaces all previous disclosures we may have provided you about our information practices. We reserve the right to change this policy and to apply any changes to previously collected information as permitted by law. If our information practices change in the future, we will notify you by posting the changes on our website. This Privacy Policy was last updated on 05/24/05. 

## Secure Shopping and Personal Information

We understand that many consumers are concerned about Internet security. REI employs industry-leading technologies to store sensitive information and protect it while in transit over the Internet. The following Security Statement describes the technologies we use and provides additional details about how we handle sensitive data like credit card information. We want you to be able to shop at REI with complete confidence. If for any reason you feel uncomfortable shopping with us online, we invite you to stop by a local [REI store](https://web.archive.org/stores/index.jsp) or call us and order by phone: 1-800-426-4840, Mon. through Sun., 4 a.m. through 11 p.m. Pacific Time. 

## The Transmission Of Sensitive Data

We work hard to protect the information that you send to us while it is en route to and from our sites. To provide secure transmission, REI employs Secure Sockets Layer technology (SSL) on those pages that involve sensitive information such as credit card numbers. SSL, which is supported by a vast majority of Internet browsers available today, is the most commonly employed method of secure, encrypted communication used on the Internet. 

We have also obtained Verisign™ digital security certificates for all of our websites. Verisign™ is an independent third party that authenticates the identity of others on the Internet. By registering with Verisign™, we provide you a method of independently authenticating that the entity you are dealing with over the Internet is actually REI. 

## What Happens To My Information After REI Receives It?

SSL protects information en route to us. Verisign™ certificate technology helps ensure that REI is the actual recipient of this information. But we don't stop there—we also work very hard to make sure the information you send us is stored and managed securely once we receive it. All data collected is stored on site and is protected by multiple levels of data and structural security. This information is only accessible to Recreational Equipment, Inc. and trusted, contracted third-party service providers. 

## REI's No-Risk Shopping Guarantee

We guarantee that every transaction you make at REI will be secure. Should any unauthorized charges ever be made to your card as a result of shopping here, you would pay nothing. 

**REI Pays Your $50 Credit Card Liability**   
Per the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50 of fraudulent charges. REI will cover the $50 if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted from purchases made through our site while using our secure server. 

Remember, in the event of unauthorized use of your credit card number, you must notify your credit provider in accordance to the reporting rules and procedures listed in your account agreement. 

## Credit Card Security

You can shop online with confidence, knowing that the financial and personal information you submit is secure. Just be sure to follow these three easy steps. 

  1. Make sure the sites you buy from use secure commerce technology. At REI, security is provided by the best Internet commerce technology available. We use Verisign as our SSL (Secure Socket Layer) digital certificate provider, allowing our customers the strongest certificate services around. Your credit card information is encrypted while traveling the Internet. As a Visa Shop Smart participant, REI offers you the safest online transactions. 
  2. You'll know your transaction is secure when a "complete key" icon appears in the lower left-hand corner of your Netscape Navigator screen, or a "closed lock" icon appears in the lower right-hand corner of your Internet Explorer screen. 
  3. NOTE—E-mail is not secure. Please remember, your e-mail correspondence should never include sensitive information you would not like to share with the general public as e-mail is never a secure environment on the Internet. 
  4. Buy from merchants you know you can trust. What makes a merchant trustworthy? 
  5. History—REI has been supplying quality outdoor gear and customer service since 1938\. 
  6. Guarantee—REI offers a 100% repair or replacement guarantee on every product sold. 
  7. Easy Access—If you have any questions regarding your REI purchase, please contact us via e-mail, at our toll-free number (1-800-426-4840), or by visiting the REI store nearest you. 
  8. Keep records. When you purchase a product and check out, print the screen so you have a paper record of your purchase. A paper record will be extremely helpful if you ever need to contact us.
