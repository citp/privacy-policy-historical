  6. **DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA**



We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table in paragraph 5 above.

  * Internal Third Parties: other companies in the ReklamStore Group acting as joint controllers or processors.
  * External Third Parties including: 
    * Professional advisers acting as processors or joint controllers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers who provide services to us.
    * Regulators and other authorities acting as processors or joint controllers who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.

If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy notice.



We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We only permit our service providers to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.

  7. **INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS**



We share your personal data within the ReklamStore Group. This will involve transferring your data outside the European Economic Area ( **EEA** ). In addition many of our external third parties are based outside the EEA so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:

  * We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.
  * Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.
  * Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.



Please contact us at privacy@reklamstore.com if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.

8. **CHILDREN**

We do not permit Services to be used to collect information from sites and apps directed to children aged 16 or under for purposes of creating interest-based profiles or serving ads based on users’ inferred interests. We may collect information from sites and apps directed to children aged 16 or under for other purposes, such as serving advertisements based on contextual information, like the content or type of the site or app (for example, serving an ad for a video game to a gaming app).

9.  **DATA SECURITY**

We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes. We may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
