### **At Florida Gulf Coast University (FGCU), your privacy is very important to us, therefore the University does not collect personal information when you visit the University website unless you affirmatively choose to make such information available.**

When you visit the University website, the University web server automatically recognizes the basic domain and IP address from which you accessed the University website. While this information is maintained, the University does not obtain email or personally identifiable data.

The University constantly measure website performance using Google Analytics that includes volume, date, time, and website pages accessed by visitors. This is done exclusively for in-house use to improve website performance and content delivery. This information is not shared with other organizations.

If you choose to email the University or complete online forms, the information you provide will be used to serve you. Some information may be saved to comply with Florida's Public Record laws, but the University will not disclose this information to other third parties or government agencies unless required to do so by state or federal law.

EMAIL PRIVACY STATEMENT**

Under Florida law, email addresses are public records. If you do not want your email address released in response to a public-records request, do not correspond via email. Instead, make contact by phone or in writing.
