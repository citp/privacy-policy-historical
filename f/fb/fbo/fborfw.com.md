# FBorFW.com is The Official Website of Lynn Johnston's comic strip For Better or For Worse.

We here at FBorFW.com are committed to the protection of privacy, and have therefore adopted protocols to ensure that everyone's visit to this site is a fun, and safe experience. 

  


**First Things First**...  
Here are some terms you should be familiar with before you read through our Privacy Protection Statement:

**Entercom Canada Inc. (ECI):** that's us!! 

**Universal Uclick:** syndicate that distributes the For Better or For Worse comic strip, and is responsible for the gocomics.com website, with whom we are affiliated

**Third party:** this website is designed and maintained by Entercom Canada Inc. Anyone not directly employed by Entercom Canada Inc. Is considered to be "a third party", and is therefore not entitled access to personal company information.

We consider personal information to be individually identifiable. It is collected online and provides details such as first and last name, email address, phone number and mailing address.

As a responsible company, doing business in compliance with all regulations regarding privacy, we hold this information in strict confidence.

**Cookies:** a sweet, oven baked treat that is.... oh wait, sorry... in this case, cookies refers to a standard technology that is used to collect non-personally identifiable information about visitors to a website. This information (visitor's browser type, monitor settings, whether this is the first visit to the site, and what section(s) of the site appeal most to the visitor) can then be used to help us improve the site, and your visit to FBorFW.com

**Children's Online Privacy Protection Act & Rule(COPPA):** regulation that came into effect April 21, 2000 that applies to the online collection of personal information from children under 13

**Child:** as specified by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, a website collecting individually identifiable information from children under the age of 13 has a unique set of guidelines to adhere to, so in this statement, the term "child" will refer to those who are under the age of 13

**PIPEDA**  
We are compliant with PIPEDA, which is the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act. PIPEDA is Canadian privacy leglislation which governs how we store and use personal information. For more information, send email to our [Chief Privacy Officer](mailto:design@fborfw.com?subject=PIPEDA).

**Gathering & Use of Information**   
Universal Uclick or Entercom Canada Inc. does not require personal information from visitors in order to gain access to any part of For Better Or For Worse's online presence; any disclosures of personal data are entirely voluntary. Information that is gathered online is used to improve our web site's content. In addition, we may use the information gathered to conduct internal marketing analysis to improve our web site for visitors. 

In some instances, users wishing to receive future e-mailings (ie. newsletters, email correspondence from Lynn or other staff of Entercom Canada Inc.) or enter contests run on the FBorFW.com site, will be asked to provide personal information on-line. Below are the different areas where visitors may opt to provide personal information, and how we handle the collected information:

**E-mail Correspondence:**  
Any personal information (e-mail info, name) collected for the purpose of e-mail correspondence with Entercom Canada Inc. is only used internally, and is deleted upon reply to the correspondence.

**Newsletter mailing list:**  
any personal information collected for the purpose of distributing the FBorFW newsletter is only used internally. This information is not shared with any third parties, and is stored where access is restriced to Entercom Canada Inc. staff only. Any subscribers to our mailing lists can request to have themselves removed from the list at any time, and their personal information will be permanantly deleted from our database records. Children under 13 are required to provide a parent or guardian's e-mail contact information, and we will contact the parent or guardian by e-mail before we will add any children under 13 to our mailing lists, requiring the parent or guardian give us written consent for that child to be added to our mailing list.

**Contests:**  
Any personal information collected for the purpose of tracking contest entries on the FBorFW.com website is only used internally, and upon completion of contest, all personal information involved with the contest entries are deleted. Children under 13 years of age are required to provide a parent or guardian's e-mail contact information, and we will contact the parent or guardian by e-mail before we will allow any children under 13 to enter a contest, giving the parent or guardian the chance to stop a child from entering the contest. No mailing address information will be requested unless entry is selected as a "winner" of a contest. Before any child under the age of 13 can provide mailing address information, we will require a signed Parental Consent Form, which we will supply. No personal information that is not required to properly run the contest will be collected from entrants.

**Purchasing Merchandise:**  
Any personal information collected for the purpose of completing an electronic purchase through the FBorFW.com merchandise section is only used internally, and will be transmitted using an encrypted code to thwart anyone trying to intercept the information provided. All personal information collected for the purpose of completing an electronic purchase is stored in an area to which the general public does not have access.

**Information Tracking:**   
Universal Uclick uses an outside service to track the total number of visitors to each area of For Better Or For Worse. Compiled in an aggregate form, this information shows us which areas visitors enjoy most, and allows us to update and improve site content. Personally identifiable information is not extracted in this process.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

We use our best efforts to ensure the security of personal information submitted by users. When collecting credit card information for on-line purchases, we offer secured-server transactions that encrypt your information in transit to thwart someone from intercepting it and misusing it. When we collect other information from our users, it is stored in an area where the general public does not have access to it. Unfortunately, no electronic communication over the internet can be guaranteed 100% secure and Entercom Canada Inc. cannot warrant the security of any information that you submit to us, and you do so at your own risk.

**Note:** Entercom Canada Inc. reserves the right to update this policy at any time.
