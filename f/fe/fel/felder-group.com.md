Transfers are not intended but users of our services and published data (such as comments) are, however, public and potentially accessible worldwide. If required, the data may be transferred to prosecution authorities, courts etc. for asserting legal claims made by the controller or third parties. 

We use the services of the following processors:

**Google Analytics**

Our site uses Google Analytics, a web based analysis service from Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. To deactivate Google Analytics, Google provides a browser plug-in at http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en. Google Analytics uses Cookies. Cookies are small text files that allow us to store specific information regarding the user on their device while they use the website. This allows analysis of the use of our web page via Google. The information collected by the cookie about the use of our pages (including your IP address) is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. We wish to make clear that Google Analytics has been extended on this website using the code 'gat._anonymizelp();' in order to provide an anonymised record of IP addresses (known as IP masking). If anonymisation is active, Google abbreviates all IP addresses within European Union Member States or in other signatory countries to the EEA Agreement, so that no assumptions can be made about to your identity. In exceptional cases only, the full IP address is transmitted to a Google server in the USA and abbreviated there. Google complies with the data protection provisions of the "Privacy Shield" agreement. It is registered with the US Department of Trade's Privacy Shield programme and uses collected information to examine usage of our website, to compile reports for us in relation to this usage, and to provide us with other related services. You can find more information at <http://www.google.com/intl/de/analytics/privacyoverview.html>.

**Clicky**

This website uses the Clicky Web Analytics service to collect statistical data on the use of our website. To this end, visitor information is collected and transmitted to servers belonging to Roxr Software Ltd.

This technology is provided by LiveZilla Ltd, Byk-Gulden-Strasse 18, 78224 Singen (www.livezilla.net). This anonymised data can be used to create pseudonym profiles. Cookies can be used for this purpose. These are small text files which are saved locally on the website user's computer, thus (potentially) allowing the user to be recognised in the event of a repeat visit to our website. The pseudonymised user profiles will not be associated with personal data regarding the bearer of the pseudonym without the separate and explicit permission of the data subject. Technical measures are taken to ensure that IP addresses are anonymised automatically. You can prevent any form of web analysis by changing the appropriate settings on your browser (e.g. handling of Cookies).
