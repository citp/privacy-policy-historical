fei privacy policy  


Financial Executives International (FEI) is committed to respecting and protecting your personal privacy. As [www.fei.org](http://www.fei.org/) functions primarily for members, our website is divided into two major sections: that portion that is available to all visitors, and that portion that is designed for members only.

There are a few instances where we do collect personally identifiable information. For instance, members are asked to provide their member number/ID in order to access "Members Only" portions of the site. Or, when registering for a conference or e-newsletter subscription, for example, a user (member or non-member) is asked to provide his or her name, e-mail, company name and some limited demographics of his/her industry. This information is submitted voluntarily.

Similar information may be submitted to FEI through membership applications, conference or teleconference registration, and magazine or e-newsletter subscriptions. Likewise, FEI does not disclose credit card account information provided by its members and customers. When members and customers choose to pay using their credit cards, FEI submits the information needed to obtain payment to the appropriate clearinghouse. **We do not provide or sell credit card, or other personally identifiable information to third parties.** If our privacy policies change, we will notify all users by a special announcement placed on our web site.

FEI does not share member email addresses with any third party. FEI will, however, on occasion provide third parties (our national Strategic Partners) with the ability to send information, approved by us in advance using U.S. mail, to members' preferred address. In most cases, these mailings are controlled directly by FEI, and the list information is not released to the third party. In any other case, mailers are asked to sign a list rental agreement, limiting their use of a member list to one-time use. In all cases, FEI approves the content and limits all such mailings to content deemed to be of some potential business value to members. 

This Web site also contains links to other web sites. FEI has no control over and is not responsible for the privacy policies or content of such sites. We recommend you read the privacy policy of each site you visit. If any visitor or member feels that their information has been handled improperly or in a manner that does not comply with this privacy policy, please contact us by e-mailing to [webmaster@fei.org](mailto:webmaster@fei.org), or by calling (973) 765-1000.
