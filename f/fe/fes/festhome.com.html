        <li>information related to any transactions carried out between you and us on or in relation to this website, including information relating to any purchases you make of our goods or services;</li>

    <li><h3>Cookies</h3>
      <p>A cookie consists of information sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. 
        The information is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server.
        This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser. </p>
      <p>We may use both ?session? cookies and ?persistent? cookies on the website.  We will use the session cookies to: 
        keep track of you whilst you navigate the website. We will use the persistent cookies to: enable our website to
        recognise you when you visit.</p>
      <p>Session cookies will be deleted from your computer when you close your browser.  Persistent cookies will remain
        stored on your computer until deleted, or until they reach a specified expiration date.</p>
      <p>We use Google Analytics to analyse the use of this website.  Google Analytics generates statistical and other
        information about website use by means of cookies, that are stored on users' computers.  The information generated

      <p>Our advertisers/payment services providers may also send you cookies.</p>

        For example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookies by clicking ?Tools?, ?Internet Options?, ?Privacy?, and
        selecting ?Block all cookies? using the sliding selector.  Blocking all cookies will, however, have a negative impact
        upon the usability of this and many other websites.</p>
