            <p>Our website uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our website. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website and also allows us to improve our site.</p>
            <p>A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we store on your browser or the hard drive of your computer if you agree. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer's hard drive.</p>
            <p>Some cookies that we use are essential to process your booking such as allowing our site to remember the details of your festival booking when you proceed to check-out and pay. </p>
            <p>Other cookies that we use enable us to recognise you when you return to our site estimate our audience size and usage pattern, store information about your preferences, and so allow us to customise our site and to provide you with offers that are targeted at your individual interests, speed up your searches and allow you to use our site in a way that makes your browsing experience more convenient.

            <p>
                We, Google and other third parties set cookies (either which are set by us or the third party provider)
                in order to track your internet behaviour after you leave the Festicket.com website in order to display to you advertisements
                that may be of interest to you when you browse third party websites – commonly known as “behavioural advertising”.
