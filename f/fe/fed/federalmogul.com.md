  1. Cookies



If your computer browser is set to allow "cookies", then our site, like most sites on the Internet, installs cookies on your computer. This type of information allows us to identify new and returning visitors to the site, evaluate browsing habits on our site, and conduct market research activities so that we can continuously improve our services. It also allows us to track visitors who come to our Websites and allows you to bypass re-entering certain identifying information if you choose to enter certain sections of our site (such as signing up as a Supplier).

  1. What are cookies?



Cookies are small text files placed on your computer by websites that you visit. These text files can be read by these websites and help to identify you when you return to a website. Cookies can be “persistent” or “session” cookies. While persistent cookies remain on your computer when you go offline, session cookies will be deleted as soon as you close your web browser.

For our EU users: The legal basis for the use of cookies is Art. 6 (1) 1 lit. f GDPR. We have a legitimate interest in analysing the use of our website/app to improve our services and advertisement.

  1. What cookies do we place on your computer and how can I avoid the cookie use?



We use cookies only to a very limited extent:

  * **Google Analytics**



For statistical analyses we use a tool called “Google Analytics”, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (“Google”), to collect information about the use of this site.

Google Analytics collects information such as how often our users visit this website, what content pages they visit when they do so, and events such as downloads and button clicks. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to determine the most useful information you are looking for, and to improve and optimize this website. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with Personal Information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google.

The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit this site, rather than your name or other identifying information. Google will use this information in order to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activities and to provide other services relating to website and internet use to us.

Google is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield, thereby ensuring an appropriate level of data protection at Google in the United States.

_  [Recommendable for EU users: We have activated the IP-anonymisation within the Google Analytics service, and your IP address will be truncated within the area of Member States of the European Union or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases the whole IP address will be first transferred to a Google server in the USA and truncated there. The IP-address your Browser conveys within the scope of Google Analytics will not be associated with any other data held by Google._]

You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this site by disabling their cookies on your browser through downloading and installing the following Browser-Plug-in: <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en>.

  * **Flashtalking**



We use a tool called “Flashtalking”. It enables us to deliver ads suited to our user’s interests. The tool is provided by Flashtalking Inc, 1101 W Fulton Market, Suite 200, Chicago, Illinois 60607, USA.

Flashtalking collects information on the websites the user visits and the user’s interaction with ads. In order to be able to identify the user’s computer, Flashtalking stores a cookie on your computer. Further, it stores user IPs on the Flashtalking servers. The cookies used by Flashtalking expire after two years.

Flashtalking may combine your user information with other information gathered from other sources such as third parties or publicly accessible sources.

Users have the ability to opt-out of our Flashtalking cookies via these links:

<http://www.youronlinechoices.com/>

<https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices>

<http://www.flashtalking.com/uk/privacypolicy/>

Flashtalking will still deliver ads to users who have opted-out of cookie use. However, these ads will be generic and not targeted specifically at the user.

In the process the Facebook, Instagram and Twitter servers recognise that you use our website/app. If you are a member of Facebook, Instagram and/or Twitter, these sites may assign this information to your personal user account. By interaction with one of the plug-ins, e.g. by clicking the 'like' button and/or the Instagram or Twitter button this information will be sent via your device directly to the respective service where it will be stored on your respective personal user accounts.
