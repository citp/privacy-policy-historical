# Privacy - Federation University Australia

[Federation University Australia ](http://federation.edu.au/) > Privacy 

The following is a general outline of the approach taken by us to privacy issues that arise when you visit our website.  


## Information collection

We gather information in two ways:

  1. **Through technology related to our website**

This can occur through the capture of information in our access logs. This information is non-personal and normally just records your internet address. We use this information for statistical purposes.

On occasions cookies may be used to assist your access to resources on our site such as electronic databases. The use of cookies is essentially restricted to easing your access and overcomes the need to re-enter passwords many times during a visit.

If you are uncomfortable with the concept of cookies, most browsers have options to reject all cookies or to require you to deliberately accept or decline each cookie offered to you. Speak to your normal source of internet advice (such as your internet service provider) if you require help setting up these options.

  2. **Through your active provision of information to us**

This occurs when you fill in an online form and submit it to us. Online forms are not secure and are submitted at your own risk. In all such instances, you choose what information you provide and you choose whether or not to submit the information to us.




## Use of information

We use information obtained on this website to:

  * improve our site
  * respond to a request or feedback from you
  * assist your access to particular resources



### Your information is protected

Information collected is for internal use by the University and is not provided to a third party unless authorised or required by law. If we plan to collect information for sharing with a third party, this will be clearly stated at the point of collection and you will have the option of declining to provide information.
