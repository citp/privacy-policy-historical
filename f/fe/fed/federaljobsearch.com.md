## America Job Privacy Policy

### Information Collection & Use

This privacy policy applies to the websites of Americajobs.com . Effective date: Mar 1, 2014. 

In order to receive job search alert emails and to fully use this Web site, you must first complete the registration form by submitting your email address, name and a password. We do not share your email address with any third parties or advertisers. We use this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest, specifically to send you matches to your job search profile. You have the option to provide additional information (such as desired income level, job location and job titles) to us; we encourage you to submit this information so we can provide you a more personalized experience on our site. 

MissionSoft Incorporated is the sole owner of the information collected on Federal Job Search or Government Job Search. MissionSoft Incorporated collects limited personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on our Web site. 

If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and billing address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you. Upon completion of any purchase the customer will receive a confirmation email from our transaction provider as a record of the transaction. 

### Information Sharing and Disclosure
