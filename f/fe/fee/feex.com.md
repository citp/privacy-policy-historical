Capitalized terms which are not defined herein, shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the TOU, which this Privacy Policy is incorporated thereto by reference.

We are not aware of the identity of the User from which we have collected Non- personal Information. Non-Personal Information is any unconcealed information which is available to us while Users are using the Site and/or Service.

  2. The second type of information is individually identifiable information ("Personal Information").   
This information may identify an individual or may be of a private and/or sensitive nature.  Personal Information which is being gathered consists of any personal details provided consciously and voluntarily by the User:
