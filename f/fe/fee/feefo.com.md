**3 Our relationship to you and your personal data**

3.1 Our legal status in relation to you and your personal data differs, depending on where you are in the review process, which we explain in this section. You should contact the “controller” of your data, as indicated below.

**Emails inviting you to submit a review** Here, we act as **data processor** , solely on behalf and on the instruction of the merchant/retailer.

Where we email you to ask you to submit a review in respect of a merchant/retailer’s product or service, that merchant/retailer has given us your name and email address, and asked us to send you such email.

We will not use your name and email address for any other purpose, unless we already hold it in respect of a review (see paragraph 3.2 below). Even where we already hold your name and email address, we will only invite you to submit a review where the merchant/retailer has provided the same name and email address.

**3.2 When you visit our website, and your review itself (and any other data you submit with it)**

Here, we act as **data controller**.

When you visit our website, we will automatically collect certain personal data using cookies and your IP address.

We may also collect personal data contained in any forms you submit to our website, including the details of any review you submit.

The purposes for which we use your personal data are set out in the table below.

Please note that merchant/retailer will also be a data controller of review data, and you may need to contact both us and the merchant/retailer to exercise rights in respect of your personal data.

**4 Who you should contact in relation to your personal data and your rights**

4.1 Where Feefo is the “controller”, as set out in paragraph 3 above, you should direct any queries you have in relation to your personal data to Feefo.

4.2 Where Feefo is the “processor”, as set out in paragraph 3 above, you should direct any queries you have in relation to your personal data to the merchant/retailer in question.

**5 The processing**

5.1 This privacy policy applies to customers of merchants/retailers that use our services, and visitors to our website.

5.2 Where a row is tinted grey, we carry out that activity as the data processor of a merchant/retailer, and any queries you have in relation to such activity should be directed to the merchant/retailer.

5.3 The table below sets out the personal data that we will collect, why we collect it, the legal basis on which we rely and how long we will keep it.

**Type of data**

Your name and email address.

Review data, including the product or service you bought, your name and location (if you provide them), email address, a customer service star rating, a product star rating and any free text you enter as part of your review.

Your IP address, the web site from which you visit us, the web pages you actually visit and the date and length of your visit.

To invite you to submit a review in respect of a product or service, on the instruction of a merchant/retailer.

To publish your review on our website.

  
Note: where you have asked us to keep your review anonymous, we won’t publish your name.

Note: where you have asked us to keep your review anonymous, we won’t provide your name.

To bring or defend legal claims.

To understand how visitors use our website.

As a data processor, we are not responsible for establishing a legal basis. The merchant/retailer, as data controller, must have a legal basis.

Necessary for our legitimate interest of carrying out market research, for example only to analyse buying trends or customer sentiment.

Our legitimate interest of bringing and/or defending legal claims.

• the expiry or termination of our contract with the merchant/retailer.

In some cases we may keep it for longer, for instance where we are required to by law or need it to bring or defend a legal claim.

We keep your data for the length of the contract we have with our customer as this is used for statistical purposes.

5.4 Where multiple retention periods apply to the same personal data, the retention period will be the longest one (although we will stop using such personal data for a purpose when the retention period for that purpose expires).

5.5 Where our legal basis for processing is legitimate interests, you may have the right to object to our processing (see the section titled “Objecting to legitimate interests processing” below).

5.6 Other than the personal data set out above, we also collect certain non personal data, which might derive from personal data. For instance, we may aggregate statistics about trends in buying habits, or trends in user sentiment. Unless it is impossible to re-identify you from this information, we will treat it as personal data.

**6 Where we obtain your personal data from**

We obtain your personal data in the following ways:

6.1 from merchants/retailers (although we do so as their data processor);

6.2 directly from you, for instance where you submit something to our website, communicate with us, or otherwise voluntarily providing personal data to us; and

6.3 from your accounts on other website, where you give us permission to do so. For instance if you use Facebook or Twitter to log into our website, we may obtain some information from those websites;

6.4 automatically when you use our website. For instance:

We do not make any solely automated decisions based on personal data with legal or similarly significant effects.

**9 Transfers outside of the EEA**

9.1 In certain limited circumstances, we may export personal data outside of the European Economic Area for processing, and we may use third party service providers who do the same.

11.2 You have the right to object to other processing on the basis of our legitimate interests, but we might not have to cease processing where you do so if either:

(d) you have objected to us processing your personal data on grounds of legitimate interests and want us to restrict processing of your personal data while we consider your objection.
