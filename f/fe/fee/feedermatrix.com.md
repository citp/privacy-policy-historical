For purposes of this Privacy Policy, "personal information" means individually identifiable information about a user collected online, including a user's first and last name, home or other physical address, e-mail address or telephone number. 

EnCirca's policies and procedures are based on the eight internationally recognized privacy principles issued in 1980 by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in its Guidelines for Fair Information Practices.

**Openness**

EnCirca has a general policy of openness about developments, practices and policies with respect to personal data. EnCirca states in detail what personal data it collects and why it collects it. 

EnCirca's Web server may log key information about any visitor to the EnCirca website (both users and non-users), including the following elements: 

  * The URL of the page requested;   

  * The time and date of the request;   

  * The make and version of the web browser being used,  

  * The version and type of your operating system);   

  * The "Referrer" (the URL where you clicked on a link to get to EnCirca's site);   

  * The IP address where a copy of the page you requested is to be sent for display by your browser. 



We use this information in aggregate to get a better picture of where our visitors come from and how to plan for our future needs. 

The web server logs may be used in the course of a fraud investigation. 

The browser make and version also is used during your visit to indicate to you whether EnCirca's software will run on your computer's configuration. The URL may contain tracking codes used only for the purpose of auditing advertising. 

**Our Use of Cookies**

At the present time, EnCirca will be using cookies to manage the session between your browser and our web site. Cookies will also be used to allow you to have a unique ID for access to our services. We will not collect any personally identifiable information via the use of cookies. Any information we collect using cookies will be used only for the purposes of web site administration and will not be shared with anyone. Should our policy change regarding the use of cookies, EnCirca will post those changes to our privacy policy. 

A "cookie" is a small piece of information sent by a web server to store on a web browser so it can later be read back from that browser. This is useful for having the browser recustomer some specific information. An example is when a browser stores your passwords and user IDs. They are also used to store preferences of start pages. 

Cookies are used to make informed guesses about you. They can be used to access information about your web activities including things like sites you've visited, passwords and purchases you've made. Companies can only make guesses about who you are because cookies do not necessarily contain personal information about you. Cookies alone are not invasive of your privacy and actually provide benefits to you. Much of what you find on the web today is free because advertising, similar to television and radio, supports it. Advertising, in part, is driven by the information contained in cookies. Cookies provide an effective way for the web sites you visit to personalize your experience when you visit them. In fact, many sites actually require that a cookie be "dropped" on your computer in order for these sites to recognize you and work properly when you visit them. 

**Our Use of Clear GIF's**

EnCirca sometimes uses a common technology called a clear gif or action tags. A clear gif (graphic interface format) is a small graphic image that is a 1x1 pixel placed on our web site, in banner ads, and/or in e-mail communications. A clear gif provides us with important information about how customers use our web site and respond to our e-mail communications, such as whether someone is using an e-mail reader that understands HTML e-mail messages. This information helps us understand the effectiveness of our web-based communications and improve it's effectiveness. For security purposes, it may also collect your IP address to be used only if fraud is associated with any activity using this IP address
