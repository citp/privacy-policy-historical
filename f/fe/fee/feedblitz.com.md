# FeedBlitz Privacy Policy | FeedBlitz - Email Marketing and RSS

You have the right to control your personal information.

We also want to present information to you that is tailored your needs. For this reason, we ask you to register or to provide personal information when you visit certain areas of the site, or subscribe to a mailing list or blog feed. We use the personal information you share with us to ensure the content and services that we provide are tailored to your current and future needs. We may also track your activity on our web site or emails we send using cookies, tracking images or links order for us to improve our service. No information about your subscriptions, activities or any personally identifiable information we collect is shared outside the company, with the exception of the owners of the feeds you subscribe to (see below).

If you register with the site, or opt in to receiving notifications when providing personal information, FeedBlitz may use your mailing address, telephone number, or email address to alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information, and new services. If you request it, we will cease to contact you using one or more of these methods.

## Email Addresses, Publishers and Subscriptions

When you subscribe to a feed published using the FeedBlitz, we _will_ share your email address with the publisher of that feed, but with nobody else. You may set your profile preferences to be anonymous to stop such notifications.

Your email address will never otherwise be shared by FeedBlitz with third parties. To prevent spamming, we require all new subscription requests to be confirmed via email (known as confirmed dual opt-in) before they are activated. If you believe your email address was added to a list FeedBlitz powers without your permission or knowledge, you should contact abuse@feedblitz.com immediately.

## FeedBlitz (First Party) Cookies

FeedBlitz requires cookies to function. Cookies are used to ensure the correct functioning of the service we provide. FeedBlitz uses such cookies (“first party cookies”) only for this purpose. If you disable first party cookies in your browser you will be unable to use FeedBlitz services.

## Third Party Cookies and Activity Tracking

FeedBlitz may engage third party data providers or ad services. These companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to enable you to receive customized ads, content or other services. No personally identifiable information is placed into these cookies. The cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us, e.g., your email address, in hashed, non-human readable form. To opt-out of these third party cookies, go to <http://www.privacychoice.org/companies> or <http://aboutads.info/choices>. Alternatively, you may configure your browser not to accept third party cookies.

Additionally, emails FeedBlitz sends may contain images which allow us to understand the time and date you open an email. Any such tracking does not collect personally identifiable information. If you wish to disable open tracking, you may do so by disabling images in your email client or app (e.g., Outlook, Outlook Express, Gmail). You should read your email client’s help documentation for more information on how to disable images.

## Server Logs

The FeedBlitz web server and parts of the FeedBlitz application log activity to file. We use logs to provide site-wide reporting, to ensure smooth operation of the services FeedBlitz delivers, and for general web site and application maintenance. Like almost all Internet servers, logged information may include timestamps, your client IP address (as it appears to the server), and the page(s) you visit. Our detailed server logs will not be shared with any third party. We may however elect to publish aggregate statistics on visitor activity from time to time based on log information (e.g. “we had 1,234 visitors yesterday”). We will never publish any personally identifiable information in these analyses.
