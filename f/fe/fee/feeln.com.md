**Information We Collect**  
We collect personal and anonymous information about you. Sometimes you provide this information directly, but we also collect information automatically through our Services, and from other sources. We also may collect information from you about other people (if you order a greeting card for another person, for example).

**Types of information we collect:**  
We collect Personal Information and Anonymous Information. "Personal Information" means information that allows someone to identify or contact you (e.g., your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of these). "Anonymous Information" means information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information. Anonymous Information does not, by itself, permit the identification of individual persons. We may create Anonymous Information by aggregating and/or anonymizing Personal Information.   
**We collect information you provide to us:**

  

  * When you create an account to log into any of our Services, you may be asked to provide us with certain Personal Information, such as your first and last name, email address, physical address and password.   

  

  * When you order products or services you will be asked to provide us with all the Personal Information and financial information necessary to complete the transaction, which may include your name, credit card information, zip code, billing address and shipping address. We do not collect financial information (such as credit card numbers) you provide through our Services, rather that information is sent directly to our third-party payment processors, who process payment transactions, and who may retain information necessary to process the transaction and store information for future purchases if you choose to do so..  

  

  * When you provide us information or content (such as images, text, contacts, events, etc) using your Account or in connection with an order for products or services, we may retain it in our servers.   

  

  * When you post content on one of our public message boards, customer support pages, or product or service review pages, we will collect that information and other users may be able to see the information you submitted.  

  

  * When you contact us for support, questions or to provide feedback, we may collect any information you provide to us directly or through your device, including your phone number, email address or any other information you provide.   

  

  * When you connect to our Services via a service provider that uniquely identifies your device, we may receive that identifier and use it to offer extended services and/or functionality.  

  

  * When you enable location services on your mobile device, we may collect your location information for a variety of purposes, including, for example, to provide you with location-based information and advertising, or notify you of our Affiliates stores or products near you. You may be able to prevent the collection of your location information through your device settings (e.g., by disabling location services on your phone).  

  

  * When you use our Services on a mobile device, including through our apps, we may collect your phone number and unique device identification number.   

  

  * We may ask or require you to provide certain other information to use certain features, and the information we require may change from time to time depending on, for example, our features and functionality, or your relationship with our Services.

  * If you downloaded or use any of our apps, we may also collect information (but not Personal Information) from your mobile device, such as the type of device you use and how you use our apps. Also, in the event any of our Apps crashes on your mobile device, we will receive information about your mobile device model, software version, and device carrier, which allows us to identify and fix bugs and otherwise improve the performance of our Apps. We may ask for authorization to access other content on your mobile device, such as contacts or photos, etc.  

  

  * Our Services and our authorized third-party providers use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and other technologies for various reasons including site customization, and functionality, analytics and advertising, which may contain Personal Information and/or Anonymous Information.

**We collect information from you about others:**

  

  * If you use our Services to send things like an ecard, paper card, video, or an invitation to use our Services, we collect Personal Information about the recipient (such as name, mailing address, and email address, as appropriate). We may share the information regarding the transaction with third parties we use to process your information (i.e., to create, send, or deliver the card or product).   

  

  * We may provide you the opportunity to add a personal list of contacts, which may include names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, events and dates (such as birthdays) for your use in connection with our Services.

We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to use Anonymous Information for any purpose, and to disclose Anonymous Information to third parties. We may create Anonymous Information records from Personal Information by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the information personally identifiable to you.   
**Our use of cookies** **What are Cookies?**  
Cookies are small pieces of information that a website saves on your hard drive when you visit a website. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them or until they expire according to their own schedule). Cookies help make parts of our Services work better, allow us to tailor the experience to your special interests and needs and provide information to help us and our service providers better understand our visitors and how they use our Services. We may use the following types of cookies:

  

  * Essential cookies are necessary to allow certain part of our Services to function. For example, they allow you to log in to areas of our Services only enabled for registered users, and help content on pages you requested load quickly. Without the use of these cookies, parts of our Service would not function.  

  

  * Functionality cookies help us provide a personal, enhanced experience each time you visit our Services. For example, functionality cookies allow us to remember choices you made when you previously used our Services, such as remembering your login details, address book, recently viewed pages, and the changes you made to other parts of our Services that you can customize.  

  

  * Analytics and performance cookies help analyze how you and other users use our Services. In addition to tracking technologies that we place, other companies may also set their own cookies or similar tools when you use the services. This includes third-party analytics services (such as Google Analytics), as well as third parties that deliver content or offers. We use that information only to improve our Services. The information generated by the analytics and performance cookies about your use of services are transmitted to analytics services that may also transfer information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process analytics Information on their behalf. Each analytics service's ability to use and share analytics Information is restricted by such analytics services' terms of use agreement and privacy policy. By using our Services, you consent to the processing of information about you by analytics services in the manner and for the purposes set forth above.   

  

  * Advertising cookies are cookies we place on our Services so that third parties (such as LiveRamp and Facebook Custom Audiences) can identify users, group them with other users with similar interests, and deliver to you and them interest-based content and advertisements. The information collected about you may also be used to track your location, activity and serve interest-based content and advertisements across multiple websites, apps, and across multiple devices. We may share information about you with our advertising partners such as your name, postal address, email, or other identifier, which is turned into hashed or obfuscated data used only to match the advertising cookie to other non- personally identifiable points. Our advertising cookie partners may also may collect information directly from your device, such as your IP address, device ID, and information about your browser or operating system; may combine our non-personal information about you with information from other sources; and may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. To opt-out of third party cookies, please go to http://www.aboutads.info/choices. To opt-out of the use of your mobile device ID for targeted advertising, please see http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices.   

  

  * Social media cookies are used when you share information using a social media sharing option on our Services (e.g., if you share your ecard on Facebook). The social network will record that you have done this, and share that information with our Services.  

  

  * Flash Cookies, or local shared objects, may be used on our Services that use Adobe's Flash Player. They allow us to enhance your flash player viewing experience, by, for example, storing your volume preferences. Flash Cookies are stored in a different location, meaning they may not be manageable from your browser settings. Read about managing privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies on this Flash Player Help Page.  

  



**Disabling cookies**

For information on how to disable cookies, please see "Your Choices About Your Information". Please note without the use of cookies, many parts of our Services, including subscriptions you may have purchased, may not function.  
**Do Not Track signals**

**Pixel Tags**  
We use "Pixel Tags" (also referred to as clear .gifs, web beacons, or web bugs), which are tiny graphic images, each with a unique identifier, that are similar to cookies and are used to track online movements of users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, pixel tags are embedded invisibly in websites and emails and can let us know when they have been downloaded and viewed. We may use such information from Pixel Tags to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user.
