# Protecting Supporters Privacy | Feeding America

_Updated June 14, 2018_

Feeding America strongly believes in protecting the integrity and privacy of personal information gathered from our supporters through all of our communication channels, as well as from visitors to our Website. The protection of your privacy is of great importance to us, we have created this privacy policy to communicate our practices regarding the collection and dissemination of personal information that you provide to us and that can be linked to a specific individual, such as a name, postal address, telephone number(s), email address, or any other information, provided to us by our supporters and Website visitors (hereinafter “Personal Information”), as well as certain non-personally identifiable information collected when you visit many of our web pages such as the type of browser you are using (e.g. Internet Explorer or Firefox), the type of operating system you are using (e.g., Windows XP or Mac OS), the domain name of your internet service provider (e.g., AT&T or Verizon), aggregate data about the number of visits to the Site and/or aggregate data about the pages visited (hereinafter “Aggregate Data”).

This policy also applies when you use social media that overlaps Feeding America’s social media and/or website.  This policy does not apply to information or data Feeding America purchases from other sources.  Feeding America uses its best efforts to not share information it collects from those persons it provides services to (commonly referred to as “clients”).  See our [donor privacy policy](https://www.feedingamerica.org/privacy-policy/donor-privacy-policy "Donor Privacy Policy") for how we use the information we collect through social media fundraising efforts, including, but not limited to MGive and similar mobile text to give programs.

This policy will be updated periodically, so please be sure to reread it from time to time. The most recent date the privacy policy was updated is provided at the top of the page. By submitting your personal information to us, you are agreeing that Feeding America may use the information in accordance with this privacy policy.

**Feeding America’s Collection and Use of Personal Information:**

Feeding America collects Personal Information supplied to us voluntarily by supporters, volunteers, and visitors to this Website.  We may use such voluntarily provided information to improve our understanding of your interests, to improve our services, or to contact you for future support. In order to utilize certain features of our site or receive information from Feeding America or make a donation, you may choose to provide Personal Information. If you do submit information to us, we will use that information for the purposes for which it was submitted. We may also use your information in other ways, such as to contact you about other Feeding America activities and/or fundraising campaigns, to conduct matching on Facebook or other social media, or as otherwise disclosed to you at the point of collection.  We may also use your name, postal address and telephone number(s) to contact you offline.  We may share your Personal Information with certain nonprofit or commercial organizations, including your designated local food bank in the Feeding America network based on the address you provide, so that they may contact you about products, services or offers that we think would be of interest to you.  If you do not wish us to contact you offline, receive such mailings or share your information with these organizations, you may opt-out by contacting us in accordance with the “Opt Out” section of this policy.

Feeding America uses third-party vendors to provide services on this Website and in offline business operations. The information that you submit on this site may be provided to those vendors on a confidential basis so that those vendors can provide services (such as maintaining our database, sending email messages, facilitating fundraising activities, or processing credit card transactions) on our behalf.

Other than as described in this privacy policy, or as may be necessary to protect the rights, property, and safety of our organization or others, or as may be necessary to comply with applicable law, Feeding America will not give or sell the Personal Information you provide online.

Feeding America uses the non-personally identifiable Aggregate Data information to improve the design and content of the Site and to enable Feeding America to personalize your Internet experience.  Feeding America may use the Aggregate Data to analyze Site usage as well as create services and/or products to fit your needs.  Also, Feeding America shares this Aggregate Data with Feeding America’s related entities, advertisers, partners, and/or other third party vendors.  Feeding America shall own such Aggregate Data and maintain copies of such as part of its records.

**Use of Email Address:**

When you donate to Feeding America or sign up on our Website, take an advocacy action, share your story or complete some other data form, you will be asked to supply your email address. Feeding America does not sell or rent your email address to any third party.  Feeding America does share your email address with local food banks in the Feeding America Network.  Email addresses gathered from donors or subscribers to Feeding America are only available to employees managing this information for purposes of contacting you or sending you emails based on your request for information, to member food banks, and to contracted service providers and vendors for purposes of providing services relating to our communications with you. 

Feeding America and its network of member food banks will only use your email address to send information about Feeding America and our network (such as news and events, special programs, and fundraising).  From time to time, we may send out email messages that might include information about like-missioned organizations and companies, but we do not provide them with access to any Personal Information that you have provided. 

Feeding America complies with those provisions of the CAN-SPAM Act applicable to charitable organizations.  All email messages contain a link to unsubscribe from Feeding America email.  You may subscribe or unsubscribe to Feeding America at any time by [contacting Feeding America](http://help.feedingamerica.org/site/PageServer?pagename=contactus) or sending a notice by United States mail to the following address at the end of this policy.  Feeding America holds the Better Business Bureau’s Accredited Charity Seal and follows the Direct Marketing Association’s Guidelines for Ethical Business Practice.  Please see our [Donor Privacy Policy](https://www.feedingamerica.org/privacy-policy/donor-privacy-policy) for how we use other Personal Information collected from donors to Feeding America.

These companies may also employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is anonymous. Specifically, Feeding America uses an Atlas Universal tag to collect anonymous cookie-based data about users who perform certain actions on a website. This data is used for measurement purposes to gauge the effectiveness of media across browsers and devices. Data collected with Atlas Universal Tags is reported on in aggregate, or via anonymous cookie-level log files. For more information on Atlas, you can view their privacy policy on [their website](https://atlassolutions.com/privacy-policy/).

Feeding America also utilizes Criteo Email Remarketing. The purpose of Criteo Email is to find visitors of Criteo advertising clients’ properties (websites, apps, and newsletters) and send them personalized emails. Criteo uses cookies to single out users and then personalize ads based on their browsing experience. To learn more or opt out of Criteo Email [visit their website](http://www.criteo.com/privacy/).

More broadly, we may work with data providers to target advertising to you personally, through online and offline methods including email, display media and direct mail. This advertising may be directed to you because you visited or logged in to our website. When we generate this advertising, data we collect from you through online cookies and other technologies may be combined with other de-identified data (such as a hashed, non-readable email or postal address) in order to tailor ads to you based on your preferences and other information about you. To learn more about targeted advertising, these providers, or how you may opt out, please visit the DAA’s consumer choice page at [http://www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).

Technologies other than http cookies may be used by third parties in a similar way, to recognize the email recipients’ computer or device and to keep track of which user identities match to which devices or browsers, and those technologies may not respond to browser settings that block conventional cookies. You may opt of many of these types of technologies by visiting the [Network Advertising Opt Out page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/). You can also opt-out of display remarketing ads directly by clicking on the blue triangle called ‘AdChoices’ in the right hand corner of the ad and follow the instructions. Please note if you delete your cookies or switch devices this exclusion won’t carry over.  We are not responsible for third parties’ use of cookies.
