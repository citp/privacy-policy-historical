A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer or mobile device for record keeping purposes. Cookies can be either session cookies or persistent cookies. We may use both session cookies (which expire once an individual closes their browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on devices until the individual deletes them) to provide a more personal and interactive experience on our Website. These cookies may be delivered by us or by third parties.

We also work with other companies who use tracking technologies to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet. These companies may collect information about interactions with us to present individuals who access our Website with opportunities to purchase Feedvisor products.

Our Website interfaces with social media websites such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter and may uses social media plugins (such as the Facebook “Like” button) to facilitate social media functions. When our Website is visited, the operator of a social media plugin may set cookies or other tracking technology on the visitor’s browser, enabling that social media operator to recognize individuals who visit our Website.

The social media plugins also allow the social media website to share information about a visitor’s activities on our Website with other users of their social media website. For example, Facebook social media plugins allow Facebook to show a visitor’s Likes and comments on our Website to the visitor’s Facebook friends.
