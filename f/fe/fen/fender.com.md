  1. _Personally Identifiable Information_

Fender may collect information you voluntarily share with us, including any content, record, or electronic communication of any kind, including without limitation your (1) contact information, (2) financial information, (3) demographic information, and (4) other personal information, subject to applicable laws and the terms of this Privacy Policy.

You are not required to provide personally identifiable information in order to visit any Fender website. You must, however, register and provide personally identifiable information in order to access certain portions of the website, be placed on Fender's E-News Service List, join the Fender Community and to enter contests and other promotions. 

Fender may use content you provide us through emails, responses to polls, contests or sweepstakes or any other promotional activity. Please be advised that any such submissions become the property of Fender and may be used by Fender for any lawful purpose, subject to applicable law. Fender can edit, rewrite, use, and reuse the content of your submissions, including your name, likeness, photograph, and biographical information in any way and in any media whether now known or invented in the future, with or without attribution, including publication in online publications, and in trade media, and advertising. You agree that any content you send us will not violate any rights of any third-party and that you will only send us content for which you own the rights. 

  2. _Non-Personally Identifiable Information_

Fender also collects other information that is not personally identifiable to you, but results solely from your visit to our website. For example, we may collect Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses. We may use web beacons and cookies, which may be placed on your computer when you access the website. 

    1. IP Addresses

Your Internet Protocol ("IP") address is usually associated with the place from which you enter the Internet, like your Internet Service Provider, your company or your university. By collecting your IP address, Fender's server may record the referring page that linked you to the Fender website (e.g., another website or a search engine), the pages you visit on this website, the website you visit after this website, the ads you see or click on, other information about the type of web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using, any search terms you have entered on this website or a referral website, and other web usage activity and data logged by our web servers. Fender may also use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers, gather broad demographic and geographic information, and administer our website. Fender may also link this information with your personally identifiable information when Fender feels that it is necessary to enforce compliance with its rules and policies, terms of service, or to protect its website, customers or others. 

    2. Web Beacons

Web beacons are Internet tools, such as transparent images on a website or in e-mails that we may send you, that help us to determine, for instance, whether a page has been viewed or an e-mail opened. For example, when you ask us to send you information on a promotion or newsletter, we may use web beacons to determine how many of the e-mails we sent were actually opened. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including a banner ad, can contain a web beacon.

    3. Cookies

Fender may use cookies to track the use of its website and to facilitate and enhance your experience. “Cookies” are small pieces of electronic data that are stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive. The cookies enable Fender to facilitate access to different aspects of the website. For example, by showing when and how you and others visit its website, cookies help Fender to see which pages of the website are popular and which are not. Cookies can also help Fender to improve your enjoyment of this website, for example, by remembering your address or other personal information when you request information or services on the website. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can disable this function so that your browser will not accept cookies. Please be aware that disabling this function may impact your use and enjoyment of this website. 

    4. Google AdWords Remarketing

Fender use Google AdWords Remarketing to advertise Fender products across the Internet. AdWords Remarketing will display relevant ads tailored to you based on what parts of the Fender website you have viewed by placing a cookie on your machine. THIS COOKIE DOES NOT IDENTIFY YOU OR GIVE ACCESS TO YOUR COMPUTER. The cookie is used to say "This person visited this page, so show them ads relating to that page." AdWords Remarketing allows Fender to tailor our marketing to better suit your needs and only display ads that are relevant to you.

* ##### Security

Fender limits third party access to personally identifiable information collected on this website. This website has security measures in place that we believe are reasonable to help protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under Fender's control. While Fender cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to data will not occur, Fender uses industry standards, such as Secure Socket Layers (“SSL”) technology, to help safeguard against such occurrences. In certain instances, the information passed between your browser and the Fender system is encrypted with SSL technology to create a protected connection between you and this website to ensure confidentiality. In the event that a breach into the Fender security systems occurs and there is a possibility that an unauthorized person acquires your personal information, Fender will notify you of such a breach under applicable law. 

* ##### Access to Your Personal Information

If you wish to have access to your personally identifiable information, please contact us with your request.
