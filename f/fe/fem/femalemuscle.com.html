<b>Sonar Network is a business unit of DoubleClick Inc.</b>
<br><br>
Internet user privacy is of paramount importance to DoubleClick, our advertisers and our Web publishers. The success of our business depends upon our ability to maintain the trust of our users. Below is information regarding DoubleClick's commitment to protect the privacy of users and to ensure the integrity of the Internet.
<br><br>
<b>Information Collected in Ad Delivery</b><br>
In the course of delivering an ad to you, DoubleClick does not collect any personally-identifiable information about you, such as your name, address, phone number or email address. DoubleClick does, however, collect non-personally identifiable information about you, such as the server your computer is logged onto, your browser type (for example, Netscape or Internet Explorer), and whether you responded to the ad delivered. 
<br><br>
The non-personally identifiable information collected by DoubleClick is used for the
purpose of targeting ads and measuring ad effectiveness on behalf of DoubleClick's
advertisers and Web publishers who specifically request it. For additional information on
the information that is collected by DoubleClick in the process of delivering an ad to you,
<a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/company_info/about_doubleclick/privacy/non_identify.htm">please click here</a>.
<br><br>
However, as described in "Abacus Alliance" and "Information Collected by DoubleClick's Web Sites" below, non-personally identifiable information collected by DoubleClick in the course of ad delivery can be associated with a user's personally identifiable information if that user has agreed to receive personally-tailored ads.
<br><br>
In addition, in connection solely with the delivery of ads via DoubleClick's DART™
technology to one particular Web publisher's Web site, DoubleClick combines the
non-personally-identifiable data collected by DoubleClick from a user's computer with the log-in name and demographic data about users collected by the Web publisher and furnished to DoubleClick for the purpose of ad targeting on the Web publisher's Web site.
DoubleClick has requested that this information be disclosed on the Web site's privacy
statement.
<br><br>
There are also other cases when a user voluntarily provides personal information in
response to an ad (a survey or purchase form, for example). In these situations, DoubleClick (or a third party engaged by DoubleClick) collects the information on behalf of the advertiser and/or Web site. This information is used by the advertiser and/or Web site so that you can receive the goods, services or information that you requested. Where indicated, DoubleClick may use this information in aggregate form to get a better general
understanding of the type of individuals viewing ads or visiting the Web sites. Unless
specifically disclosed, the personally-identifiable information collected by DoubleClick in these cases is not used to deliver personally-tailored ads to a user and is not linked by
DoubleClick to any other information.
<br><br>
<b>Abacus Alliance</b><br>
On November 23, 1999, DoubleClick Inc. completed its merger with Abacus Direct
Corporation. Abacus, now a division of DoubleClick, will continue to operate Abacus Direct, the direct mail element of the Abacus Alliance. In addition, Abacus has begun building Abacus Online, the Internet element of the Abacus Alliance.

<br><br>

The Abacus Online portion of the Abacus Alliance will enable U.S. consumers on the
Internet to receive advertising messages tailored to their individual interests. As with all
DoubleClick products and services, Abacus Online is fully committed to offering online
consumers notice about the collection and use of personal information about them, and
the choice not to participate. Abacus Online will maintain a database consisting of
personally-identifiable information about those Internet users who have received notice
that their personal information will be used for online marketing purposes and associated
with information about them available from other sources, and who have been offered the
choice not to receive these tailored messages. The notice and opportunity to choose will
appear on those Web sites that contribute user information to the Abacus Alliance, usually when the user is given the opportunity to provide personally identifiable information (e.g., on a user registration page, or on an order form).

<br><br>

Abacus, on behalf of Internet retailers and advertisers, will use statistical modeling
techniques to identify those online consumers in the Abacus Online database who would
most likely be interested in a particular product or service. All advertising messages
delivered to online consumers identified by Abacus Online will be delivered by
DoubleClick's patented DART technology. 

<br><br>

Strict efforts will be made to ensure that all information in the Abacus Online database is
collected in a manner that gives users clear notice and choice. Personally-identifiable
information in the Abacus Online database will not be sold or disclosed to any merchant,
advertiser or Web publisher. 

<br><br>

Name and address information volunteered by a user on an Abacus Alliance Web site is
associated by Abacus through the use of a match code and the DoubleClick cookie with
other information about that individual. Information in the Abacus Online database includes the user's name, address, retail, catalog and online purchase history, and demographic data. The database also includes the user's non-personally-identifiable information collected by Web sites and other businesses with which DoubleClick does business.  Unless specifically disclosed to the contrary in a Web site's privacy policy, most non-personally-identifiable information collected by DoubleClick from Web sites on the DoubleClick Network is included in the Abacus Online database. However, the Abacus Online database will not associate any personally-identifiable medical, financial, or sexual preference information with an individual. Neither will it associate information from children. 
<br><br>
<b>Sweepstakes</b><br>
DoubleClick's Flashbase, Inc. subsidiary provides automation tools that allow our clients to provide online contests and sweepstakes ("DoubleClick sweepstakes").
<br><br>
All DoubleClick sweepstakes entry forms must provide a way for you to opt-out of any communication from the sweepstakes manager that is not related to awarding prizes for the sweepstakes. Entry forms must further provide consumers with a choice whether to receive email marketing materials from third parties. When you enter a DoubleClick sweepstakes, the information you provide is not be shared with DoubleClick or any third party, unless you agree by checking the opt-in box on the sweepstakes entry form. If you enter a sweepstakes, you agree that the sweepstakes sponsor may use your name in relation to announcing and promoting the winners of the sweepstakes. See the official rules of the sweepstakes you are entering for additional information. 
<br><br>
DoubleClick does collect aggregate, anonymous information about the sweepstakes. That information is primarily used to help sweepstakes managers choose prizes and make other decisions regarding the organization of the sweepstakes. DoubleClick does not associate information provided through the sweepstakes with your other web browsing activities or clickstream data.

<br><br>
<b>Email</b><br>
DoubleClick uses DARTmail, a version of DART technology, to bring you emails
that may include ads. Email is sent only to people who have consented to
receive a particular email publication or mailing from a company.  If at any
time you would like to end your subscription to an email publication or
mailing, follow either the directions posted at the end of the email
publication or mailing, or the directions at the email newsletter company’s
Web site.
<br><br>
In order to bring you more relevant advertising, your email address may be
joined with the information you provided at our client’s website and may be
augmented with other data sources.  However, DoubleClick does not link your
email address to your other Web browsing activities or clickstream data.
<br><br>

<b>Information Collected by DoubleClick's Web Sites</b><br>
The Web sites owned or controlled by DoubleClick, such as www.NetDeals.com and
www.IAF.net may ask for and collect personally-identifiable information. DoubleClick is committed to providing meaningful notice and choice to users before any personally-identifiable information is submitted to us. Specifically, users will be informed about how DoubleClick may use such information, including whether it will be shared with marketing partners or combined with other information available to us. In most cases, the information provided by a user will be contributed to the Abacus Online database to enable personally-tailored ad delivery online. Users will always be offered the choice not to provide personally-identifiable information or to have it shared with others. 
<br><br>
<b>Access</b><br>
DoubleClick offers users who have voluntarily provided personally-identifiable information to DoubleClick the opportunity to review the information provided and to correct any errors.
<br><br>
<b>Cookies and Opt Out</b><br>
DoubleClick, along with thousands of other Web sites, uses cookies to enhance your Web
viewing experience. DoubleClick's cookies do not damage your system or files in any way. 
<br><br>
Here's how it works. When you are first served an ad by DoubleClick, DoubleClick assigns you a unique number and records that number in the cookie file of your computer. Then, when you visit a Web site on which DoubleClick serves ads, DoubleClick reads this number to help target ads to you. The cookie can help ensure that you do not see the same ad over and over again. Cookies can also help advertisers measure how you utilize an advertiser's site. This information helps our advertisers cater their ads to your needs.

<br><br>

If you have chosen on any of the Web sites with which Abacus does business to receive ads tailored to you personally as part of Abacus Online's services, the cookie will allow
DoubleClick and Abacus Online to recognize you online in order to deliver you a relevant message.

<br><br>

However, if you have not chosen to receive personally-targeted ads, then the DoubleClick cookie will not be associated with any personal information about you, and DoubleClick (including Abacus) will not be able to identify you personally online.
<br><br>


While we believe that cookies enhance your Web experience by limiting the repetitiveness of advertising and increasing the level of relevant content on the Web, they are not essential for us to continue our leadership position in Web advertising. 

<br><br>

While some third parties offer programs to manually delete your cookies, DoubleClick goes one step further by offering you a "blank" or "opt-out cookie" to prevent any data from being associated with your browser or you individually. If you do not want the benefits of cookies, there is a simple procedure that allows you to deny or accept this feature. By denying DoubleClick's cookies, ads delivered to you by DoubleClick can only be targeted based on the non-personally-identifiable information that is available from the Internet environment, including information about your browser type and Internet service provider.
By denying the DoubleClick cookie, we are unable to recognize your browser from one
visit to the next, and you may therefore notice that you receive the same ad multiple times.

<br><br>

If you have previously chosen to receive personally-tailored ads by being included in the
Abacus Online database, you can later elect to stop receiving personally-tailored ads by
denying DoubleClick cookies.

<br><br>

Your opt-out will be effective for the entire life of your browser or until you delete the<br>
cookie file on your hard drive. In each of these instances, you will appear as a new user to
DoubleClick. Unless you deny the DoubleClick cookie again, DoubleClick's ad server will deliver a new cookie to your browser.
<br><br>
If you would like more information on how to opt-out, please click <a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/privacy_policy/privacy.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br><br>

<b>Disclosure</b><br>
DoubleClick makes available all of our information practices at <a href="http://www.doubleclick.net" target="_blank">www.doubleclick.net</a>,
including in-depth descriptions of our targeting capabilities, our privacy policy, and full
disclosure on the use of cookies. In addition, we provide all users with the option to contact us at <a href="mailto:info@doubleclick.net">info@doubleclick.net</a> with any further questions or concerns.
<br><br>

<b>Security</b><br>

DoubleClick will maintain the confidentiality of the information that it collects during the
process of delivering an ad. DoubleClick maintains internal practices that help to protect
the security and confidentiality of this information by limiting employee access to and use of this information.

<br><br>

<b>Industry Efforts to Protect Consumer Privacy</b><br>
DoubleClick is committed to protecting consumer privacy online. We are active members of the Network Advertising Initiative, NetCoalition.com, Online Privacy Alliance, Internet Advertising Bureau, New York New Media Association, and the American Advertising Federation.
