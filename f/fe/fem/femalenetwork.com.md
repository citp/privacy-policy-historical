Welcome to FemaleNetwork.com and GIRLTalk! We’re glad to have you in our community and we hope you’ll have a great time. At FemaleNetwork.com, we are committed to protecting your privacy. All the personal information you share with us is used strictly to enhance your FemaleNetwork.com experience. If you participate in contests or promotional features, only demographic information will be reported to the sponsors unless you stated your interest in receiving more information from the sponsors. 

This document will shed light on all your questions about your activities on FemaleNetwork.com. Please read on for more details about our privacy policy.

**What information do we collect? How do we use it?**  
1\. When you register to become a FemaleNetwork.com member, we ask for your name, gender, birthday, marital status, educational attainment, location, occupation, personal income/monthly allowance and name of school/employer. We also ask you to answer some simple questions about your lifestyle and personal preferences, such as Internet usage and hobbies. We use this information to create a profile of our members that will help us develop our features and services. This profile will be presented as general demographics in our media kit and other advertising materials. We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others. We only provide personal information to sponsors if you specify your interest in receiving information from the sponsors. 

2\. When you subscribe to any of our newsletters (Femail, Sweet Reminders, etc.), all we need is your email address, which is used to send your chosen newsletter. 

3\. To create topics and post messages in GIRLTalk, our message boards, you should be a registered GIRLTalk member. Guests may peruse some of the sections but will not be able to post. Your username is displayed alongside your post and your email address will not be disclosed to anyone ([Read the complete GIRLTalk house rules](http://www2.femalenetwork.com/board/viewforum.php?f=3).) 

We may republish your GIRLTalk posts to enrich FemaleNetwork.com content. If we do so, we will notify you. Republished posts will be identified only by usernames alone. We promise to be very sensitive in this effort. ([See details on republication of GIRLtalk posts](http://www.femalenetwork.com/about/privacy/bbsrules.html).) 

4\. To enter a contest or promotion, you must be a registered FemaleNetwork.com member. We use your personal information to administer the contest and notify the winners. 

Female-friendly companies and retail stores sponsor our contests. Contest sponsors will be authorized to access Contest Reports that may contain the following: contest statistics (total number of participants and date joined); contest results (list of winners and tabulation of answers); and participant demographics (such as age and gender). On the Contest Central homepage as well as in your personal Member Profile page, we provide the option to receive more information from the sponsor. You will receive such information only if you choose to. 

5\. We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to our website, new services, and special offers we think you'll find valuable. If you would rather not receive this information, visit your personal Member Profile page to change your preferences. Make sure to change your preferences for each account or email address you have left with us.
