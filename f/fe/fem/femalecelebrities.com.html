    <td valign="top"><div>We have created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate 
        our firm commitment to privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices 
        with respect to the collection, use, and disclosure of personal and non-personal 
        information provided by visitors to our Web site. By using this site, 
        you signify your assent to our privacy practices and the terms and conditions 
        of our Web site. If this policy is not agreeable to you, please do not 
        use this site. </div>
      <dl class="faq">
        <dt>What type information is collected?</dt>
        <dd> We only collect personal information from visitors to our Web site 
          when they voluntarily provide it to us by completing our registration 
          form or electing to use one of our services. We may require visitors 
          to provide us with information including, but not limited to, their 
          name, physical address, email address, birth date, username, password, 
          and on occasion a unique identifier. </dd>
        <dd> When visitors access our Web site, certain non-personal information 
          may be collected from them including, but not limited to, their browser 
          type (e.g., Netscape or Internet Explorer), operating system (e.g., 
          Windows or Macintosh), IP address, and the domain name from which they 
          accessed the site (e.g., google.com). In addition, we may collect information 
          about visitors' browsing behavior, such as the date and time they visit 
          the Web site, the areas or pages of our Web site that they visit, the 
          amount of time spent viewing the site, the number of times the visitor 
          returns to the site, and click-stream data. We use transparent tracking 
          pixels to determine the number of Web site visitors that have been sent 
          to us through our affiliate network. We do not track any information 
          about visitors once they leave our site. We may use cookies (small text 
          files that are stored on visitors computers when they access our Web 
          site) to collect this information. Information collected through cookies 
          may be combined with visitors' personal information. We may also allow 
          unaffiliated third parties, such as advertisers, to serve cookies to 
          visitors of our Web site. Visitors are always free to decline cookies, 
          but in doing so they may not be able to use certain features on our 
          Web site. The "help" segment of the toolbar on most browsers explains 
          how to configure a browser to not accept new cookies, how to have the 
          browser inform a user when they receive a new cookie, and how to erase 
          cookies from their hard drives. </dd>
        <dt>In what way do we use your personal and non-personal information?</dt>
        <dd> Our goal in collecting personal information is to provide visitors 
          with the most personalized Web experience possible and our advertisers 
          with an efficient means to reach the right audience. By knowing a little 
          about our visitors, we are able to deliver more relevant content and 
          advertisements, and provide better services. We may use information 
          collected from visitors to our Web site for any of the following purposes: 
          (1) to send visitors information and promotional materials about our 
          company, (2) to send visitors information and promotional materials 
          from our marketing partners and third parties (such as advertisers on 
          our Web site), (3) to deliver targeted display advertisements and offers 
          by email (by matching criteria provided by our advertisers with information 
          collected from our visitors), (4) to contact visitors to our Web site 
          when necessary, (5) to allow one-click purchases or access to proprietary 
          content by pre-populating fields, within registration or other transaction 
          screens, with a visitor's name, billing address, and credit or charge 
          card information (among other things), as provided by that visitor, 
          (6) to help diagnose problems with our server, (7) to administer our 
          Web site, (8) to conduct internal reviews of our site (e.g., to determine 
          the number of visitors to the site), (9) to help us better understand 
          visitors' use of our site, and (10) to protect the security or integrity 
          of our site. Non-personal information will be used for purposes of conducting 
          internal reviews of the site, monitoring the site, and providing a greater 
          online experience for our visitors. </dd>
        <dt>What security measures do we take to protect your data?</dt>
        <dd> To help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data integrity, and 
          ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place certain 
          physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure 
          the information we collect from visitors to our Web site. We use SSL 
          (Secure Socket Layer) technology to protect any credit card information 
          you provide us. We allow access to personal information only to persons 
          and entities engaging in activities provided for by this Privacy Policy. 
          Visitors should consider any communication that they transmit to us 
          (such as data, questions or answers, comments, suggestions, or communications 
          submitted to a chat room) to be non-confidential. We will not be liable 
          or responsible if information that belongs to a visitor is intercepted 
          and used by an unintended recipient. </dd>
        <dt>We protect children's privacy.</dt>
        <dd> Protecting the privacy of children is VERY important to us. For that 
          reason we do not structure any part of our site to attract anyone under 
          the age of 18 (21 in some areas) and we do not allow anyone under the 
          age of 18 (21 in some areas) to register and become a member of our 
          site. </dd>
        <dt>Corporate changes.</dt>
        <dd> In the event of a merger, acquisition, asset or stock sale, bankruptcy, 
          or other asset transfer (regardless of legal formality), any of our 
          assets may be transferred to a third party, including personal information 
          collected from visitors to our Web site. </dd>
        <dt>Acceptance of privacy terms &amp; conditions</dt>
        <dd> By visiting this Web site, you are agreeing to the practices described 
          in this Privacy Policy. By visiting this site, you also accept, without 
          limitation or qualification, all terms and conditions concerning the 
          use of this site. We may at any time revise these terms and conditions. 
          You are bound by any such revisions and should therefore periodically 
          visit this page to review the current terms and conditions to which 
          you are bound. To the extent that any of the third-party sites accessible 
          through our Web site (such as our advertisers) have different privacy 
          practices from those stated in this Privacy Policy, those third-party 
          privacy practices govern the collection and use of information you provide 
          when visiting those sites. We are not responsible for the policies, 
          content, and practices of other companies. </dd>
        <dt>Changes to this privacy policy</dt>
        <dd> There may be times when we need to change the terms of this Privacy 
          Policy. To ensure that you are aware of our current privacy practices, 
          please bookmark this page and check back often. </dd>
        <dt>How can you access the information we have collected from you?</dt>
        <dd> Visitors who wish to access or change the information they provided 
          to our Web site, should visit the Customer Service section of this site 
          and contact us via Email. </dd>
