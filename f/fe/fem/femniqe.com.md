We recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of information collected about visitors to our website, in particular, information that is capable of identifying an individual (“personal information”). This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which your personal information is obtained through the website and how will it be dealt with.

By using this site, you agree to the Privacy Policy of this website ( _www.Femniqe.com_ ), which is set out on this website page.

We reserve the right, at our discretion, to modify or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at any time. This Privacy Policy is in addition to any other terms and conditions applicable to the website. We do not make any representations about third party websites that may be linked to the website.

This Privacy Policy should be reviewed periodically so that you are updated on any changes. We welcome your comments and feedback.

 **WHO WE ARE**

This Privacy Policy relates to the collection and use of personal information you may supply to us through your conduct on the website.

In terms of your use of this website, we act in the capacity of Data Controller which means we are responsible for determining the purpose of personal data collecting and processing.

If you have any questions or concerns about the data we hold about you, you can contact us by using via email: femniqe@gmail.com.

 **OVERVIEW**

In order for us to operate our business and provide our services to you, sometimes it is necessary that we collect and process your personal data. In general terms, this data can be divided into three categories:

  * Information that you provide to us directly. For example, where you complete an online form on our website.
  * Information that is automatically sent to us by your computer’s internet browser when you visit our website. For example, your computer’s IP address.
  * Information about how you use our website or our services. For example, which pages you visit, how frequently you visit the site, for how long, etc.



This Privacy Policy sets out the detail of what information we collect, as well as how we use that data and how we protect it.

 **WHAT DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION FOR?**

Any of the information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways:

  * To personalize your experience (your information helps us to better respond to your individual needs)
  * To improve our website (we continually strive to improve our website offerings based on the information and feedback we receive from you)
  * To improve customer service (your information helps us to more effectively respond to your customer service requests and support needs)
  * To process transactions (Your information, whether public or private, will not be sold, exchanged, transferred, or given to any other company for any reason whatsoever, without your consent, other than for the express purpose of delivering the purchased product or service requested.)
  * To administer a contest, promotion, survey or other site feature
  * To send periodic emails (With your permission, we may send you emails about diet info, new products, and other updates.)
  * The email address you provide for order processing may be used to send you information and updates pertaining to your order, in addition to receiving occasional company news, updates, related product or service information, etc.



 **Note:** If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails you simply have to click the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any email we send. Then you will be taken through the simple unsubscribe process.

 **HOW DO YOU GET MY CONSENT?**

When you provide us with personal information to complete a transaction, verify your credit card, place an order, we imply that you consent to our collecting it and using it for that specific reason only.

If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like marketing, we will either ask you directly for your expressed consent or provide you with an opportunity to say no.

 **HOW DO I WITHDRAW MY CONSENT?**

If after you opt-in, you change your mind, you may withdraw your consent for us to contact you, for the continued collection, use or disclosure of your information, at any time, by contacting us at femniqe@gmail.com.

 **PERSONAL INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO US DIRECTLY**

Personal information that you provides us directly is collected only when knowingly and voluntarily submitted. For example, we may need to collect such information to provide you with further services or to answer or forward any requests or inquiries.

It is our intention that this policy will protect your personal information from being dealt with in any way that is inconsistent with GDPR privacy laws.

 **LAWFUL BASIS FOR PROCESSING UNDER THE GDPR:**

When you communicate with us or sign up for promotional materials, we process such data on the basis of our legitimate interest, Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR, and our legitimate interest is to provide you with our promotional messages.

Where we are required under applicable local law to obtain your consent for sending you marketing information, the legal basis is your consent, Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR.

 **DATA MINIMIZATION:**

We will only ask you for the minimum amount of information required to appropriately fulfill your request. This will usually be your email address and any specific information about your request.

 **DATA RETENTION:**

We will retain this data for a maximum of 12 months.

 **TYPES OF PROCESSING:**

  * After you provide us with your personal data, we will store the information you provide to us in our website database, and/or in our self-managed Customer Relationship Management system. All our CRM systems are GDPR compliant. This way we are enabled to efficiently access your data and respond to your requests;
  * For the purpose of maintaining the integrity of our systems, we may also store this data in system backups
  * We may use this information to contact youabout other of our own services that we believe may be of genuine interest to you
  * We will NEVER use this data for any further purpose without you expressing further consent
  * We will NEVER sell your information to any 3rd party.



 **INFORMATION THAT IS AUTOMATICALLY SENT TO US BY YOUR COMPUTER’S INTERNET BROWSER**

Before GDPR, when you visited our website, our system was saving a record of your visit in our server logs, and this record included the IP address that is associated with your device.

The storage of IP addresses is a common practice and it allowed us to identify patterns of behavior (such as repeated malicious attempts to access a system).

However, from now on, our hosting provider is working on deleting those data or making them completely anonymous. Also, from now on, as we were informed, those data will no longer be available to us, only to our hosting provider for the amount of time they are legally obliged to keep them for debugging and security reasons.

 **INFORMATION ABOUT HOW YOU USE OUR WEBSITE OR OUR SERVICES**
