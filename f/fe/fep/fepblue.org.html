We do not collect any information that can reveal your personal identity unless you voluntarily provide it when you register to use interactive features of the site or to receive information from us or our member Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies ("Blue Plans"). We do not collect and save any Protected Health Information (PHI). Any section of fepblue.org that is directed to children or teens will be protected by a screening mechanism to help ensure parental consent is obtained before we collect or use personal information from children under 13. We do not knowingly collect or use information from children under 13 without the consent of a parent or guardian.</p><p>Personally-identifiable information voluntarily provided by you may be retained indefinitely for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice.</p><p>If you use the features on this Web site or on the Web sites of our Business Partners, you are "opting in" and agree to our collection of information as described above. You can "opt out" or prevent us from collecting PHI or PII by not using the interactive features of this Web site or the Web sites of our Business Partners. You may "opt in" or "opt out" each time you access the Web site. If you "opt out", you cannot use the interactive features, such as the Provider Directory, BlueNews, and Pharmacy Programs.</p><p><strong>Use of the information this site gathers/tracks:</strong></p><p>The non-personally identifiable information we gather and store in aggregate form is only used to maintain or improve our Web site, and we may share that information with other areas in BCBSA, local Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans, our Business Partners, or with companies we hire to help us maintain or improve the Web site.</p><p>Any personally-identifiable information you voluntarily give us will be stored in a secure environment and used only to provide the product, service, or information you have requested or for which you registered.

 browsing history in order to improve the experience on the site. The browsing history is stored anonymously and it is not transmitted to or readable by other sites but <a href="/index.jsp" title="FEPBlue.org Home" xmlns:tridion="http://www.tridion.com/ContentManager/5.0">fepblue.org</a>
.</p><p><strong>Sites we link to:</strong></p><p>If you choose to use any of the links we provide to our member companies, sponsors, and other third party resources, you will be leaving our Web site and going to a new Web site. Protection of your privacy at those other sites will be governed by the privacy policy at that site. Please take the time to read the privacy policies at their sites. We have business relationships with the local Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans, Caremark, McKesson, OPM, Allianz Global Assistance or World Access, supplemental benefit companies, and the FEP Operations Center. These linking relationships are not a form of advertising or promotion, but part of the unique set of benefits available under the Service Benefit Plan and the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association of Plans. Nor are the links to other sites within our Web site of an advertising or promotional nature.</p><p><strong>Changes to this policy:</strong></p><p>If we make any significant changes to this policy, we will let you know the effective date of the changes and provide a tool for you to understand what has changed.</p><ul><li>Policy updated 8/2010 – cookies are now used on the site. See "Cookies and Spyware" section for details.</li></ul><p>Includes changes and clarifications to our Mail Service Pharmacy Program Benefits manager.</p><p><strong>Glossary of Terms:</strong></p><p><strong>Aggregate Information or Data:</strong></p><p>A Web site may gather individual pieces of non-personal Information from the individuals who use the Web site. The Web site may combine similar data from many or all of the users of the Web site into one data category. For example, all of the users who accessed the Pharmacy Programs feature on our Web site. The combined data or aggregate data does not identify each user, but provides the total number of times the Pharmacy Programs was accessed from www.fepblue.org during a specific time period.</p><p>On <a href="/index.jsp" title="FEPBlue.org Home" xmlns:tridion="http://www.tridion.com/ContentManager/5.0">www.fepblue.org</a>
, we collect aggregate data to monitor what features are accessed on our Web site and monitor what features are most useful to our members.</p><p><strong>Cookie:</strong></p><p>A Cookie is a small data file that is stored on the hard drive of the computer you use to view a Web site. Normally, Cookies are used by the Web site owner or advertisers on the site to help make the site easier to use or track usage on that site or other sites where the advertiser may have a presence as well. For example, if a password and user ID are needed to sign into a Web site and there is a box for you to check to store your password for future use, your password is stored in a Cookie on your computer.</p><p><strong>Non-Personal Information:</strong></p><p>This is information that cannot be traced back to any individual user and cannot be used to identify the individual user.</p><p><strong>Opt-In:</strong></p><p>If you "opt-in", it means that you are actively indicating your selection of a feature on this Web site. Usually, it also means you must provide certain information, such as your ZIP code, ID number, address, or e-mail address to use the selected feature. For example, if you use our online Provider Directory to locate a provider near where you live, you must enter at least your zip code to use this feature. Another example: if you subscribe to BlueNews, you must enter your e-mail address to receive updates and e-newsletters from FEP by e-mail. When you use an interactive feature and enter personal information, you are opting-in for that feature.</p><p><strong>Opt-Out:</strong></p><p>If you "opt-out," it means that you have to take some action to avoid the collection of any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or Protected Health Information (PII). To "opt-out" on our Web site, you are choosing not to use any interactive feature or feature that allows us to collect PII or PHI. For example, when you opt-out, you cannot use our Provider Directory, Pharmacy Programs or other features that ask you to enter information.</p><p><strong>Personal Health Information (PHI):</strong></p><p>When your Personally Identifiable information (PII) is combined with your known health conditions, the information becomes Personal Health Information.</p><p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information (PII):</strong></p><p>This is information that identifies you as an individual, such as your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and Social Security Number.</p>
