## HIPAA

**

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) was enacted by the U.S. Congress. This legislation concerns your rights as a consumer and the health care privacy practices that protect your rights. It affects not only how your personal medical information is handled, but also how you and your confidential information are treated when working with your doctor, health insurance provider or other medical practitioner. Learn more about its components and how it works to protect you and your confidential medical information.

**Understanding HIPAA**

####  HIPAA is comprised of four areas of regulation — privacy, security, information transactions and code sets, and national identifiers. Learn how the different components work and how they relate to you and your confidential medical information.

**Privacy Regulation**

The HIPAA privacy regulation is a “use and disclosure” set of requirements enacted in 2003 that defines how the Service Benefit Plan can use and share your confidential medical information. The regulation limits the use and disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI). PHI includes any individually identifiable health information, such as your demographic and clinical information as well as related business and insurance data.

The regulation asserts that privacy is a “fundamental right.” This has transformed the way Americans view their right to control their medical information and medical services. You are now in the driver’s seat on how your confidential medical information is used and disclosed.

**BCBSA compliance**

Some of the basic steps we have implemented to comply with privacy regulations include:

  * Adopting policies and procedures to protect the privacy of protected health information
  * Adopting policies and procedures that give individuals specific rights to their health information, including the rights to
    * access and copy health information
    * be informed of certain disclosures
    * request corrections/amendments
    * request limits on disclosures your office makes
    * receive confidential communication
  * Creating a written notice describing how the BCBSA and the local BlueCross BlueShield Plans use and disclose your PHI information and provide you a copy of the notice document
  * Designating a privacy official to handle complaints and questions about the notice of privacy practices
  * Providing policies and procedures training for personnel
  * Implementing appropriate safeguards to protect member information from improper disclosure
  * Establishing a reporting and response system for privacy violations
  * Developing a sanctions policy for the discipline of privacy violations by employees



**Security Regulation**

While the privacy regulation pertains to all PHI - paper or electronic, the HIPAA security regulation, enacted in 2005, deals specifically with Electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI). It states that we must:

  * Protect confidentiality, integrity and availability of all electronic protected health information that we create, receive, maintain, or transmit
  * Protect against any reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information
  * Protect against any reasonably anticipated uses or disclosures of such information that are not permitted or required under the privacy part of the HIPAA regulations
  * Ensure compliance of the HIPAA security regulations by our employees



Confidentiality means that your PHI is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized persons or processes. Integrity means that your PHI has not been altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner. Availability means that your PHI is accessible or usable upon demand by an authorized person. The regulation also asserts that we maintain strong and up-to-date security controls on all electronic files that contain your PHI.

Physical security is a major component of the regulation. The law mandates the protection of equipment and information from damage and environmental threats, such as floods and fires, and physical threats such as unauthorized access to information.

**BCBSA compliance**

There are a number of steps that we have taken to implement these security regulations including:

  * Designating a security officer to handle security complaints and security breaches to the PHI
  * Developing a contingency plan and disaster recovery plan to continue operations after a storm or other event out of BCBSA’s control
  * Maintaining strong access control and securing the physical facility
  * Adopting and training our employees on HIPAA security policies and procedures



Physical security is a major component of HIPAA security. It protects equipment and information from damage and environmental and human threats and offers control of, and protection within, a facility.

  * Environmental threats include water, fire, humidity and power surges.
  * Physical threats include door access, escorting guests within the secure areas, equipment in a secure area, and ventilation duct access.
  * Human threats include personnel screening before hiring, access to secure areas restricted and personnel trained in security needs and actions.



The regulation asserts that and BCBSA has strong and up to date security controls must be in place on all electronic files that contain your PHI.

**Information Transactions and Code Sets**

In October of 2003, standardized transactions and code sets were implemented to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal programs, as well as the healthcare industry in general. These new transactions and code sets were designed to simplify the administration within the healthcare system and enable efficient electronic transmission of certain health information through Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).

**What is EDI?**

EDI is the electronic transfer of information in a standard format between trading partners. EDI allows entities within the healthcare system to exchange medical, billing and other information and to process transactions in a manner which is fast and cost effective. EDI substantially reduces the handling and processing time of information as well as the risk of losing paper documents.

**The HIPAA Claim Form**

In the early 1990s the health care industry asked the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to help the industry create one, and only one, claim form. The industry had previously tried to create one claim form and did not succeed. Designed to streamline the administration of healthcare, the HIPAA claim form has replaced approximately 400 various claim forms for medical services, 200 claims forms for dental services and the previously used pharmacy claim form.

**Electronic Transactions and Code Sets**

In addition to a standard claim form this rule also established standards and specific code sets to be used for the following eight electronic transactions:

  * Health care claims or equivalent encounter information
  * Eligibility for a health plan
  * Referral certification and authorization
  * Health care claim status
  * Enrollment and disenrollment in a health plan
  * Health care payment and remittance advice
  * Health plan premium payments
  * Coordination of benefits



The medical data codes sets include:

International Classification of Diseases, 9th Edition, Clinical Modification, (ICD—9—CM), Volumes 1 and 2

International Classification of Diseases, 9th Edition, Clinical Modification, Volume 3 Procedures

Code on Dental Procedures and Nomenclature, as maintained and distributed by the American Dental Association, for dental services

The Health Care Financing Administration Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS)

Healthcare clearinghouses, health plans and other healthcare insurance companies plus providers who submit the administrative transactions in electronic format must use these standard electronic formats and code sets.

**Unique Identifiers**

The final component of HIPAA is national identifiers regulation. The uniform identifiers permit your doctors and hospital providers, dentists, plus pharmacists to spend much less time dealing with the bureaucracy of getting paid.

There are three HIPAA National Identifiers:

  1. Employer ID Number (EIN)
  2. National Provider Identifier (NPI)
  3. National Health Plan Identifier



Both the EIN and the NPI have been implemented. The HIPAA EIN is the IRS federal tax number of a healthcare business. The EIN is necessary on some of the healthcare transactions outlined above under the transactions and code set area. It has been used on these transactions since 2004.

The National Provider Identifier (NPI) was implemented in May 2008 and requires that all providers completing electronic transactions, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, use only to identify covered healthcare providers on the standard HIPAA transactions outlined above. This means that today, the claim form your doctor and hospital uses to process your medical, or dental, or pharmacy services uses the one NPI as opposed multiple identifiers. Again, this allows a more efficient, streamlined processing of transactions.

When the National Health Plan Identifier HIPAA regulation is released, it will add to this efficiency by again going from many identifiers to one identifier.

**Your Privacy Rights**

As a healthcare consumer, HIPAA asserts that privacy is your fundamental right. Learn more about your personal rights as it relates to your medical information. The HIPAA privacy regulation is a “use and disclosure” set of requirements enacted in 2003 that defines how we can use and share your confidential medical information. The regulation limits the use and disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI). PHI is individually identifiable health information that includes your demographic and clinical information as well as related business and insurance data.

Under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, you have individual rights that allow you to request the following:

**Notice of Privacy Practices**

A Notice of Privacy Practices is issued to all Service Benefit Plan contract holders when they enroll and whenever there is a material change to the privacy practices provided in the notice. In situations where there are material changes, the revised Notice of Privacy Practices will be distributed to all contract holders within 60 days of the change. To review our current privacy practices please download the following:

[Notice of Privacy Practices for the Service Benefit Plan](https://web.archive.org/en/terms-and-privacy/notice-of-privacy-practices)

[Notice of Privacy Practices for the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM)](http://www.opm.gov/information-management/privacy-policy/)

**Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information (PHI)**

In order for BlueCross and BlueShield Health Plans to disclose information about you that is not for the purposes of treatment, payment or healthcare operations, you must first authorize a person and/or organization to receive your PHI. By completing and submitting an Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information form, you are allowing the designated individual(s) to have access to only the PHI specified by you on the form.

This form is ideal if you need assistance with handling specific claims or only wish for the designated individual to have limited access to your PHI that will expire in a timeframe not more than one year. It is important to note that this form does not allow the authorized individual(s)/organization(s) to make any healthcare decisions on your behalf. If you wish to authorize the designated individual to be able to make healthcare decisions on your behalf you will need to use a Personal Representative Authorization Form.

This form will generally require the following information (1) a description of the PHI to be Used or Disclosed, (2) a statement of who is authorized to receive the PHI, (3) A description of the purpose for which the disclosure is permitted, (4) an expiration date, and (5) member’s signature.

**Appoint a personal representative**

The Personal Representative Authorization form allows you to designate a personal representative who will act on your behalf in making decisions related to healthcare, which includes treatment and payment issues. This individual can be a family member, friend, lawyer or unrelated third party.

Your designated personal representative stands in your shoes and has the ability to act for you and exercise your rights. For instance, at your request BCBS must provide your personal representative access to your Protected Health Information (PHI) to the extent such information is relevant. In addition to exercising your rights under the Privacy Rule of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, a personal representative may also authorize disclosures of your Protected Health Information (PHI).

This form is ideal if you require ongoing, comprehensive assistance. It is important to understand that the individual you list as your personal representative has the authority to make healthcare-related decisions on your behalf. If you require permanent assistance with your healthcare needs, you may also submit a legal power of attorney to BCBS.

**Access to your medical record and be permitted a copy of it**

The Request for Access form is used to make a request to inspect and/or obtain copies of your Protected Health Information (PHI) maintained by BCBS and our Business Associates.

Please note that the BCBS reserves the right to deny access to psychotherapy notes, information compiled for legal proceedings, on-going research or obtained from a confidential source. We also reserve the right to deny access if we believe it may cause you any harm, but we must grant you a review procedure.

**An accounting of your medical information and record disclosures**

The Request for an Accounting of Disclosures form allows you to receive an accounting of the disclosures of your Protected Health Information (PHI) by BCBS or our business associates. The maximum disclosure accounting period is the six years immediately preceding the accounting request; however we are not obligated to account for any disclosure made prior to the Privacy Rule compliance date of April 14, 2003.

The Privacy Rule **does not** require accounting for disclosures:

  * for treatment, payment or healthcare operations
  * to you or your personal representative
  * for notification of or to persons involved in your healthcare or payment for healthcare, for disaster relief or for facility directories
  * pursuant to an authorization
  * of a limited data set
  * for national security or intelligence purposes
  * to correctional institutions or law enforcement officials for certain purposes regarding inmates or individuals in lawful custody
  * incident to otherwise permitted or required uses or disclosures



Accounting for disclosures to health oversight agencies and law enforcement officials must be temporarily suspended on their written representation that an accounting would likely impede their activities.

BCBS must respond to your written request within 60 days from the date it was received. However, if we are unable to give the requested accounting to you within the 60-day deadline, we will notify you in writing that we will be utilizing our right to a 30-day extension provided we explain the reason for the delay and when we will act on your request.

**Amendment to your Protected Health Information**

The Request for Amendment form allows you to ask BCBS to amend medical information we have about you that you feel is incorrect or incomplete. You have the right to request an amendment as long as the information is kept by or for BCBS. Requests for amendments must provide a reason that supports your request and can be denied.

BCBS may deny your request only if the information was not created by us and the originator is no longer available, access is deniable or the Protected Health Information (PHI) in question is accurate and complete. If the amendment is denied, BCBS must accept a written statement of disagreement that will be kept with your designated record set.

The BCBS must respond to your written request within 30 days from the date it was received.

**Confidential communication**

The Request for Confidential Communication form allows you to request an alternative means or location for receiving communications of Protected Health Information (PHI) by means other than those that we typically employ. For example, you may request that the Health Plan communicate with you through a designated address or phone number.

BCBS must accommodate reasonable requests if you indicate that the disclosure of all or part of the PHI could endanger you. The Health Plan may not question your statement of endangerment. However, we may condition compliance with a confidential communication request on you specifying an alternative address or method of contact and explaining how any payment will be handled.

Once a request for confidential communication goes into effect, all of your PHI will be processed in accordance with your instructions. This means that we cannot process a request to withhold only the PHI relating to a specific condition, diagnosis, or treatment. Therefore, all documents that might contain PHI about all of the service you receive will be addressed to you and not the contract holder.

Even if you request confidential communications, the check for services you receive from a non-participating provider could be sent to you but made payable to the contract holder, unless you have made other payment arrangements with us. Therefore, we urge you to discuss with us how we can arrange to pay your claims for services that you receive from a non-participating provider. Accumulated payment information such as deductible status and catastrophic protection benefits in which your PHI might appear, will continue to appear on all future Explanation of Benefits (EOB) sent to the contract holder for service rendered by all providers (participating and non-participating).

If you terminate your request for confidential communication, the restriction will be removed for all of your PHI that we hold, including PHI that was previously protected. Therefore, you should not terminate a request for confidential communications if you remain concerned that disclosure of your PHI will endanger you.

**Restriction on the use and sharing of your medical information**

The Request for Restriction form allows you to request a restriction or limitation on the medical information we use or disclose about you for treatment, payment or healthcare operations. You also have the right to request a limit on the medical information we disclose about you to someone who is involved in your care or the payment for your care, such as a family member or friend. We are not required to agree to your request. If we do agree, we will comply with your request unless the information is needed to provide you emergency treatment.

This form will generally require that you provide (1) the information you want to limit, and (2) how you want us to limit the use and/or disclosure of the information.

**Make a privacy complaint**

You may file a complaint to us if you believe that we have violated your privacy rights. This form will generally only require a description of the privacy right violation and your contact information for follow-up communication. To make a complaint, please call the [customer service number](https://web.archive.org/en/contact-us) for your local Blue Cross and Blue Shield company and ask for the privacy (HIPAA) contact. 

**File a request**

All forms can be obtained from your local Blue Cross and Blue Shield company. To file a request, please call the [customer service number](https://web.archive.org/en/contact-us) for your local Blue Cross and Blue Shield company and ask for the privacy contact. Please submit the appropriate form for each item to the privacy contact. Please note, it is important that you direct your request to the privacy contact in order to ensure your request is addressed in a timely manner.

## Healthcare Fraud

Healthcare fraud is more damaging than you probably imagine. Though committed by a very small number of people, healthcare fraud affects every patient, doctor and hospital in the country, wasting billions of dollars every year. A goal of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan is to preserve healthcare quality and affordability. That's why we're working with hospitals, doctors, consumers and, where appropriate, law enforcement agencies to identify and stop healthcare fraud. 

**What is healthcare fraud?**

Everyone makes the occasional mistake, especially in an industry as complex as healthcare. Rest assured, inadvertent errors are not considered fraudulent.

Healthcare fraud is the intentional, unlawful misrepresentation or deception for the purpose of gaining unauthorized benefits - financial or otherwise. Abuse is defined as reckless conduct that goes against and is inconsistent with acceptable business and/or medical practices resulting in greater reimbursement.

Fraud and abuse can compromise patient safety and future care. One example of patient harm is unnecessary, sometimes invasive, medical procedures. A provider who enters false codes on a patient for purposes of greater reimbursement leaves the patient with a false diagnosis being associated with their or their family's medical history.

**Common examples of medical and pharmacy healthcare fraud**

**  
** Fraudulent schemes are limited only by the imagination of the individual committing the fraud. Common examples are: **  
**

  * Billing for services not rendered
  * Billing for medically unnecessary services
  * Misrepresentation of services
  * Misrepresentation of identity
  * Ineligible dependents
  * Altered claims (medical/prescription)
  * Thin air scripts
  * Shorting
  * Doctor shopping
  * Falsification of application (SF 2809)



**What the BCBS Service Benefit Plan is doing about fraud**

The National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association estimates that the financial losses due to healthcare fraud are in the tens of billions of dollars each year. And with healthcare costs going up every year, so too are the costs of healthcare fraud.

The Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan invests in numerous programs that raise the industry standard for healthcare fraud prevention.

  * Each Blue Cross and Blue Shield company has its own investigative unit that actively pursues fraudulent activities and the recovery of monies lost to fraudulent or abusive activities.
  * Computer and software technology analyzes millions of claims for patterns of suspicious billing activity.
  * The Blue Cross and Blue Shield Anti-Fraud Task Force works with medical professionals and government agencies to uncover fraud in multiple states.
  * Our Blue Cross and Blue Shield Anti-Fraud Hotlines receive more than 80,000 calls a year.



**Fraud prevention and you  
**  


Blue Cross and Blue Shield is committed to protecting our members, healthcare providers, and federal benefits against healthcare fraud. But we can't stop healthcare fraud alone. We need the participation and support of institutions and individuals.

 _How you can help_

  * Think of your healthcare card as being as valuable as your credit card. If you think your card was stolen, you should contact your local Plan and request a new contract ID when you request a new card to prevent unauthorized use.
  * Carefully review your Explanation of Benefit (EOB) notices and medical bills and verify dates, reasons and costs to ensure that you and/or the Service Benefit Plan is being billed for services that were actually received.
  * Be aware of "free" services. If patients are asked to provide their insurance card, the service may not be free and could be fraudulently charged to them or their insurance company.
  * Avoid using professionals who tell you they know how to bill for uncovered services.
  * Do not leave your ex-spouse on your contract after your divorce has been finalized. If you have been ordered by the court to cover your ex-spouse for an extended period of time you must first terminate your ex-spouse from your contract which must be proven via copy of divorce decree and provide new coverage for them under a separate policy or contract.
  * Do not include anyone on your contract that is not legally considered your spouse or dependent.
  * Maintain clear and accurate records relating to your medical history including dates of office visits and prescriptions.



These efforts are making a difference. With your help, we can do even more to preserve healthcare quality and affordability.
