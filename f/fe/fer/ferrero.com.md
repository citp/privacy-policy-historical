 **Ferrero** intends to use your Personal Data, collected through the **Website** , for the following purposes:

• To provide answers or services you request, including allowing the creation of an account, to receive information from **Ferrero** and sending you alerts by means of push notifications; to verify your identity and assist you, in case you lose or forget your login/password details for any of **Ferrero** ’s registration services; to allow you to create and maintain a registered user profile, to process transactions and enrolments you request, to contact you when necessary and respond to your requests and enquiries, including emails; to process card payments and to provide any other services which you may request; to send you newsletters you have subscribed to as a service (containing only informative content); to finalize purchase orders and deliver products bought on the **Website** and to provide any other services which you may request (“ **Service Provision** ”).   
No consent is required for the processing of data for the purposes since such processing is necessary to provide the services requested and, therefore, for the performance of an agreement to which you are a party or for the implementation of measures requested by you prior to entering into an agreement (GDPR art. 6,1b). It is not mandatory for you to give **Ferrero** your Personal Data for these purposes; however, if you do not, **Ferrero** will not be able to provide any services to you.   
• For marketing, promotional and publicity purposes, including to carry out direct marketing, as well as to carry out studies, research, market statistics or surveys, via e-mail, SMS, push notifications, pop-up banners, instant messaging, phone calls by an operator, **Ferrero** ’s official social media pages, regarding **Ferrero** ’s products and services (“ **Marketing** ”), and to send you offers, promotions or other information about our goods and services. Processing for these purposes is based on your consent. It is never mandatory for you to give consent to Ferrero for the use of your Personal Data for these purpose, and you will suffer no consequence if you choose not to give it (aside from not being able to receive further marketing communications from **Ferrero** ). Any consent given may also be withdrawn at a later stage.

You can block these communications, and you will suffer no consequence if you do so (aside from not being able to receive further communications from **Ferrero** ), by objecting through the unsubscribe link provided at the bottom of all such communications.  
• To create your user profile (individual and/or aggregate profiles) on our **Website** , by collecting and analyzing information on the preferences you select and choices you make on the **Website** as well as on your general activities on the **Website** , through the use of profiling cookies (“ **Profiling** ”). This information will be used to personalize the Services provided through the **Website** , where possible, to suit your preferences and choices, as well as to serve you with information and advertisements which may be relevant to you and your interests, to propose customized offers that may be of your interest, to give you information about other websites/services which **Ferrero** believes you may be interested in. All algorithms involved in this processing are regularly tested, to ensure the processing’s fairness and control for bias. Processing for this purpose is based on your consent, collected by means of the cookie pop-up banner and/or a specific tick box.

• For compliance with laws which impose upon **Ferrero** the collection and/or further processing of certain kinds of Personal Data, including regulations on contests in case users participate to contests or prizes on our **Website** (“ **Compliance** ”). When you provide any Personal Data to Ferrero, **Ferrero** must process it in accordance with the applicable laws, which may include retaining and reporting your Personal Data to official authorities for compliance with tax, customs or other legal obligations. No consent is required for the processing of data for this purpose since such processing is necessary to comply with a legal obligation (GDPR, art. 6, 1a).  
• To prevent and detect any misuse of the **Website** , or any fraudulent activities carried out through the **Website** (“ **Misuse/Fraud** ”). Processing for this purpose is necessary to pursue Ferrero’s legitimate interests in preventing and detecting fraudulent activities or misuse of the **Website** (for potentially criminal purposes).  
• To analyze and improve our service provision, enhance the **Website** , evaluate the effectiveness of Ferrero’s marketing activities and services, perform statistical and demographics analyses on **Ferrero** ’s corporate clients and registered users (“ **Analytics** ”).   
Processing for this purpose is necessary to pursue **Ferrero** ’s legitimate interests in the development and administration of the **Website** and to improve the services provided on the **Website**.

Users shall not be required to provide Personal Data to browse public pages of the **Website**. The provision of Personal Data for the purposes mentioned above is optional, however, failure to provide required data (indicated as such in the registration form, as applicable) may prevent users from completing registration or availing of related services.

In the framework of its activity and for the purposes specified above, your Personal Data may be shared with the following entities (“Recipients”):

• Other companies within the **Ferrero** Group for internal administrative purposes; and  
• Duly appointed data processors, providing specific processing or accessory services (e.g. storing data, sending out messages for us, web hosting, contests’ management, consumer service, IT services regarding the **Website** operation, emailing) on Ferrero’s behalf and under its instructions, whose data protection maturity has been checked by Ferrero before entering into the required data processing agreement.

In the event that **Ferrero** learns that it has inadvertently collected Personal Data from a child under the age of 16, Ferrero will promptly delete such information.

If parents/guardians would like to prevent a minor from accessing the **Website** , programs are easily available which enable control over access to the Internet or specific websites.

 **Security of Personal Data**

All Personal Data collected and processed through the **Website** will be stored and processed so as to minimize the risk of destruction, loss (including accidental loss), unauthorized access / use or incompatible use with the initial purpose of collection.

• Personal Data processed for **Service Provision** will be kept by **Ferrero** for the period deemed strictly necessary to fulfil such purposes. Information will, however, be kept for longer if we need it to address any claims regarding the services or to protect **Ferrero** ’s interests related to potential liability related to the Service Provision.  
• Personal Data processed for **Marketing and Profiling** will be kept by **Ferrero** from the moment you give consent until the latter is withdrawn. Where it is not withdrawn, consent will be asked to be renewed at fixed intervals of 24 months. Once consent is withdrawn (or not given, following a renewal request), Personal Data will no longer be used for these purposes, although it may still be kept by **Ferrero** as it may be necessary to protect **Ferrero** ’s interests related to potential liability related to this processing. Personal Data processed for Soft Spam will be kept by **Ferrero** from the moment where it is provided by you to **Ferrero** until you object to this processing. Once you have objected, Personal Data will no longer be used for these purposes, although it may still be kept by **Ferrero** , in particular as may be necessary to protect **Ferrero** ’s interests related to potential liability related to this processing.  
• Personal Data processed for **Compliance** will be kept by **Ferrero** for the period required by the specific legal obligations for which the Personal Data was processed.   
• Personal Data processed for preventing **Misuse/Fraud** and **Analytics** will be kept by **Ferrero** for as long as deemed strictly necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected.
