# Privacy Policy - FertilityFriend.com

Last Updated May 2018

FertilityFriend.com is committed to respecting your privacy. Since we started offering Trying To Conceive tools on the web in 1998, we have been extremely sensitive to the private nature of this type of information.

#### Guiding Principle

We do not share your data with any third party except if absolutely necessary to operate the service or because of legal or regulatory requirements.

FertilityFriend.com is fully funded by its VIP service fees and has been so since we started. It does not rely on any type of data trading for any of its funding or any other purpose. In other words, you are not the product. Clear and straightforward, our charting service is what we sell and nothing else. 

An immediate consequence of this principle is FertilityFriend.com does not provide advertising, sponsorship, recommendations or product reviews on the service.

#### Data provided by users

  * **Registration Information:** This includes your email address and date of birth. Please note that we do not ask for or store your real name, address or precise location or any other personal identification data. The email address is used as the primary identifier of the account. We generate a random password and ask for a recovery word/phrase. We also store your current timezone to make sure the time sensitive data is tuned to your local time. The password can be changed by the user if desired. The date of birth is used to verify the age requirement (18+) as well as for specific tailoring of the analysis.

  * **Charting Data:** The object of the service being the analysis of your charting data, we collect the data you enter and use it to present you with interpretation and analysis as per the service purpose.

  * **Charting Home Page:** Users can create a charting home page which they can customize with specific messages. This is optional.

  * **Forum Posts:** Users can participate in our private forums and post messages and images. Please note that contrary to most internet forums, posts and images have a limited 90 day life span and are deleted after that time. Posts are not available to search engines and cannot be accessed by non members.

  * **Community Galleries:** Fertility Friend's users can optionallly contribute anonymized data to community galleries and let other users benefit from their experiences.

  * **Charting Course:** If you registered for the optional charting course your course registration data is kept as proof of consent according to Canada anti-spam laws.

  * **Order history:** We do not store online any financial data or actual names or addresses, just an order id and product id. European customers can only order via the Apple App Store or Google Play. These services do not share any specific information about the customer's identity. Customers who can and elect to order via Stripe.com or PayPal.com need to refer to these services' privacy policies.

  * **Customer Service Emails:** We keep all correspondence related to customer support and service. These emails are used for historical purposes to give context to requests and help resolve issues.




#### Automatically Collected Data

  * **Server Logs:** As customary in the industry, we collect server logs to operate the service. These logs are kept for less than 90 days and are used to identify errors and resolve internal issues. They include IP addresses used to trace issues and investigate abuse/fraud situations.

  * **Web Cookies:** Fertility Friend only uses first party cookies (the cookies are only read or written by Fertility Friend for its own usage). These cookes are used for session management and preferences storage.




**Important Note:** Fertility Friend **does not** use any third party analytics or marketing services (such as ad networks, social network targeting, usage analytics services or similar) and thus does not share any usage data or other information with such services. The mobile platform providers (Apple for iOS and Google for Android) provide basic usage data in aggregate format as they do for all apps on their platform.

FertilityFriend.com will cooperate fully with verified law enforcement authorities and government agencies whenever duly requested to do so. 

Fertility Friend relies on a few services and contractors to run its business. These services are used for basic infratructure and include cloud computing providers and network services to accelerate the application performance. These services are contracted for specific purposes as customary in the industry.

Fertility Friend does not store financial data (credit card number...). This data is solely handled by the payment processor (Apple App Store, Google Play Store, Stripe.com and PayPal.com depending on the choice/availability of /to the user).
