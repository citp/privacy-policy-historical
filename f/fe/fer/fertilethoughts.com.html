<h2>Collecting Personal Information</h2>
<p> "Personal Information" means any information obtained through your use of our Website which might reasonably be used to specifically identify you and may include your name, address, email and phone number, among other things. If and when we collect Personal Information from you, we do so on a voluntary basis and this enables us to give you access to the registered users portions of our Website which may include features, functions, promotions, products and services not generally available to non-registered users. </p>
