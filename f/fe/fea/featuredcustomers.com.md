For example, if you visit the Website from an advertisement on another site or from social media, the pixel tag will reference the cookie you received when you clicked on the advertisement. The pixel tag also may register this activity with a business partner to allow us to count the number of times or when an advertisement is accessed. This data is collected for use in FeaturedCustomers.com’ marketing and research, as well as to inform our Providers on Website activity and user behavior. The pixels that are tracking activity can be provided by FeaturedCustomers.com, by our Providers, and/or third-party advertising, social media or websites. Personally identifiable information about you is not collected by pixel tracking, nor is any tracking information generated from the pixel tag allowed to be used for any other purpose other than to report Website activity to us.

  5. ### Third-party Advertising

We use third-party advertising companies to serve some or all of the advertisements you see on the Website.
