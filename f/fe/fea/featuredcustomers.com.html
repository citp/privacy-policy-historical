For example, if you visit the Website from an advertisement on another site or from social media, the pixel tag will reference the cookie you received when you clicked on the advertisement.

This data is collected for use in FeaturedCustomers.com’ marketing and research, as well as to inform our Providers on Website activity and user behavior. The pixels that are tracking activity can be provided by FeaturedCustomers.com, by our Providers, and/or third-party advertising, social media or websites.

<h3>Third-party Advertising</h3>

</li>
<li>
<h3>Legal Disclaimer</h3>
