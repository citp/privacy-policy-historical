<p><a name="anchor5"><b><span lang="EN-GB">YOUR SECURITY</span></b></a><b><span lang="EN-GB"><br>
<br>
</span></b><span lang="EN-GB">F1i.com takes every precaution to protect our
users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site,
your information is protected both online and off-line.<br>
<br>
<b>Online Security</b><br>
Whenever one of our registration or order forms asks users to enter sensitive
information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that
information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in
the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock
icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft
Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you
are just 'surfing'.<br>
<br>
Offline Security<br>
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do
everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users'
information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted
in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific
job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are
granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use
password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return,
they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information.
Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy
practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our
employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on
privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is
protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable
information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.</span></p>

<p><a name="anchor6"><b><span lang="EN-GB">LINKS TO EXTERNAL SITES</span></b></a><span lang="EN-GB"><br>
<br>
F1i.com may offer links to other sites so that you can conveniently access
relevant content and visit our vendors and advertisers. Please be aware that we
are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We urge you
to inquire about the privacy policy of any Web site before providing any
personally identifiable information. </span></p>

<p><a name="anchor7"><b><span lang="EN-GB">OPTING OUT AND CHANGING YOUR PERSONAL
INFORMATION</span></b></a><span lang="EN-GB"><br>
<br>
Information provided at the time of Registration or submission from a user who
is 13 years of age or over may be used for marketing and promotional purposes
by F1i.com and our affiliates and / or companies, which have been prescreened
by F1i.com. We provide visitors the opportunity to opt-out of receiving
communications that are not directly related to our site when we first request
registration or order information.<br>
<br>
After you've chosen to opt out, we will do our best to ensure that you do not
receive additional messages or information from us, but are not responsible for
further contacts that derive from activities to which you previously consented.
Any information previously given to our vendors, advertisers and others cannot
be rescinded. We may retain personal information in our files despite your
request to delete it in order to cooperate with law enforcement personnel or
third parties to investigate possible crimes or resolve disputes; to enforce
our User Agreement; to evaluate technical difficulties with the site; and for
other internal purposes. Because we follow standard back-up procedures to
assure the integrity of our computer and database systems, and due to technical
constraints, it may not be technically possible to completely remove all of
your personal information from our files. </span></p>
