## What information does Favor collect?

  * **Personal Information.** When we refer to “ **Personal Information** ” in this Privacy Policy, we mean any information by which you may be personally identified or contacted, whether online or offline. When you use the Service or fill out any forms located on the Website or the App, we may collect certain Personal Information from you, such as your first and last name, address/location, email address, phone number, and gender.. Additionally, if you apply to be a runner, we may collect certain other Personal Information from you as further described in our Runner Software Agreement and/or runner policies and procedures. As a customer user or a runner, it is always your choice whether or not to provide Personal Information. If you choose not to provide requested Personal Information, you may not be able to participate in certain activities or use certain features of the Service or the App.
  * **Technical Information.** We may also collect and use technical data and related information, such as information about your device, system and application software, peripherals and other data related to your interactions with the Service (“ **Technical Information** ”). We automatically collect Technical Information through the use of “cookies” and other similar collection technologies, like pixels, web beacons and local storage. The information we collect from these technologies may include your web settings and preferences, website analytics information, device type, phone operating system and push ID. Favor does not consider this information to be Personal Information. Favor owns all Technical Information and may use it for any lawful purpose. Depending on your browser, you may be able to remove and reject cookies from our Website or the Service by changing your browser settings.
