1\. INTRODUCTION

Maintaining your trust for Favro AB and our affiliates (“Favro”, “we”, “us”, “our”) and our services is our top priority. This document, the Favro Privacy Policy for Favro, explains to you how we process your personal information when you for example visit our homepage, try our software services and or ask us to help you through support requests. Personal information is information that can be traced back directly or indirectly to and identifies you as an individual such as your name, address, email, physical location, or phone number (“Personal Information”).

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time and we reserve the right to do so. Any changes we may make to our Privacy Policy in the future will be posted on our website so please revisit it periodically. If you continue to use our site and services, or provide us with Personal Information following the posting of any changes to this Privacy Policy, this shall mean that you have accepted those changes. If the changes are material, we may provide more prominent notice or seek your consent to the new policy.

If you have any concern about providing information to us or having such information used in any manner permitted in this Privacy Policy, you should not provide us with any Personal Information and you should not visit our website, or use our services.

2\. WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT

Favro AB is the data controller of the information monitored, collected, used, stored or otherwise processed in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

We may collect both Personal Information (as defined above) and Non-Personal Information (that is information, which is not Personal).

Non-Personal Information will be collected, used or stored only on an aggregate basis. This collective data, which is used for internal purposes, helps us improve your online experience and facilitate your use of our services. We do not connect this data to any Personal information collected from you.

If we have collected information, which consists of both Personal and Non-Personal (“Combined Information”), we will treat the Combined Information as Personal Information.  
Personal Information will be requested when you engage in the following activities:

• When you subscribe to Favro

• When you send us data to troubleshoot an issue

Sometimes a request to our support results in that we may ask you for a crash dump, a copy of your database or other information that might be sensitive for various reasons and that may include Personal Information. This information may also be submitted to us through a dialog that appears if you encounter a crash. This information will solely be used for troubleshooting and we will delete the information after we are done with the troubleshooting.
