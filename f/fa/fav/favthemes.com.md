# Privacy - Amazing Joomla Templates - Joomla Extensions

This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which FavThemes collects, uses, maintains and discloses information collected from users (each, a "User") on our website ("Site"). This privacy policy applies to the Site and all products and services offered by FavThemes.

### 1\. What kind of User related information do we collect and store (and for how long)

We collect and store User related information (personal identification information and anonymous information) from Users in a variety of ways: when the User visits our Site, creates an User account, places an order or submits a support request by e-mail.

We will collect personal identification information from Users only if they voluntarily submit such information to us, by creating an account and submiting their explicit consent regarding our internal policies using our registration form.

We will always try to collect the minimum required information (either personal identification information or anonymous one) from our visiting Users in order to allow them to browser or Site, buy our products, download, use and update them in a technical productive manner and initiate electronic payments.

When registering an account on our Site, Users may be asked for a name and/or email address.

Before initiating an order, the User's cart history related information is stored for a short period of time on our server. This period depends on how long the User will continue to navigate our platform before closing the browser

After initiatiting an order, the User's order history related information is stored on our server.

If the User has initiated and completed a payed order, the order history realated information will be stored for a period of time that depends on our general legal or fiscal obligations (in some cases, even 10 years). If a payed User decides to delete his account, the order history related information will remain on our server linked only with the User's email address.

If the User has initiated and completed a free order, the order history related information will be stored untill the User requests its deletion, but not longer than 5 years, as this information can still be needed by the User in order to have access to his product's updates.

For anti-fraud related purposes, we may also store information related to the User's device [IP address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) (the IP address that was attached to the User's device when he initiated and completed the payment).

When interacting anonymously with our Site (that is, without creating a User account), we may store your browser header http headers information (the information your browser sends to our server in order to identify itslef) and your device IP address, following the standard way a server stores the interactions it has with a web client/browser. This kind of information (also known as "logs") might be used for anti-fraud or anti-hacking/craking/virus purposes and is deleted periodically by our automatic scripts. This deletion is also supervised by our system admin.

### 3\. Where is the User information stored and who has access to it

The User's name (if any), email address, cart and order history (if any) are stored on our server's database. The User's device IP address might as well be stored on our server's database (when linked to a payed order) and/or on our server's filesystem logs (for the other anonymous information your browser sends to our server).

When the User sends us an e-mail (support or commercial related), this e-mail is stored on our email server but might also be archived on our internal backup server. Depending on their purpose, these messages will be stored for a period of time that depends on our general legal or fiscal obligations (in some cases, even 10 years, for invoice related messages).

The above stored information can only be accessed by a very limited number of people (a maximum of three FavThemes trusted employees, with high technical and security training).

### 4\. What rights do you have regading the personal information stored on our server

You can always have access to see the personal information stored on our server. This operation can be done from your User's account page and you can also request a centralized file to be provided to you with the personal information stored on our server using the designated tool from your User's account page.

You can always choose to modify the personal information stored on our server (including the diffrent types of consents you selected at some point in time). This operation can be done from your User's account page or can be requested from us via [support@favthemes.com](mailto:support@favthemes.com). The order related information can only be modified in certain cases (if we agree for a discount or if you want to delete your account and order history and you haven't purchased any payed products). Otherwise, this information cannot be edited or deleted, for fiscal and anti-fraud purposes.

Still, modifying parts of the personal information (ex: canceling the acceptance of our "Terms and conditions") might lead to the impossibility of using our services.

You can always choose to delete all your personal identification information from our server. If so, you need to send a request to [support@favthemes.com](mailto:support@favthemes.com) or using the designated tool from your User's account page. Your request will be processed shortly and you will receive a status confirmation by e-mail.

You can always have access to what type of personal identification information we store on our server (and for how long) and to the way it is stored, accessed and used.
