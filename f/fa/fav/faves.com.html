    <h3>Faves Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>Faves provides an
      online application that helps people find and discover things by leveraging the
      power of their social networks. To accomplish this, registered users of the
      Faves software and/or website (“Users”) may create shared information. Users
      may also send email invitation requests to other Users. &nbsp; For the purposes
      of this Privacy Policy, each such other User is a “Friend” and is defined as
      someone you have sent a request to or explicitly invited to share information with
      you. To fulfill the purpose of our website, we need to display a limited amount
      of personal information so that Users are able to evaluate the trustworthiness
      of particular pieces of information, each a Fave, and the possible
      reviews, ratings, or opinions expressed therein. Each Fave created by a User via
      Faves’ technology has the ability to be made private and to therefore be
      made available solely to the authoring User.</p>

    <h4>Information We Collect</h4>

    <p>By using the Faves
      software and/or website you explicitly agree to permit the collection and use
      of your personal information by Faves as outlined below in this Privacy
      Policy.</p>

    <p>Faves collects User
      submitted account information such as name and email address to identify you
      and send you notifications related to your use of the Faves software. Faves
      also collects User submitted location information such as city, state or
      zip code, and User submitted comments and ratings about the various Fave which
      you create. All such User submitted data is collected and stored at Faves’
      or its agent’s facilities for possible aggregation, sale and/or provision to
      third parties. If such aggregated data is sold, no personally identifying
      information about any User, such as name or email, will be supplied to the third
      party.</p>

    <p>Additionally, some
      information we collect is not explicitly submitted by the User. For instance,
      we log your browser-type related information, IP address, requested and
      referring URLs and timestamp. This information helps us diagnose problems with
      our servers, administer support, and otherwise provide the highest possible
      level of service to you.</p>

    <h4>How We Use Your
      Information</h4>

    <p>Information such as your
      full name or email address may be shown to your Buddies or other Users
      primarily in conjunction with Faves you have contributed and designated as being
      available for viewing by the general public. If you have designated another
      User as a Friend they can also see your name or email address in their list of
      Buddies.</p>

    <p>Your full name and email
      address may also be used when you send an email notification to another User,
      such as in a request for faving activity, in an invitation, when sharing a
      Fave, or when forwarding a request. Faves may also use your email address to
      send you updates or news regarding our site. You can opt out of receiving such
      communications by emailing <a href="mailto:removeme@faves.com">removeme@faves.com</a>.
      Additionally, we may use your email address to contact you on behalf of your
      Buddies (such as when a Friend asks for a Fave).</p>

    <h4>Transfer of Information</h4>

    <p>Other than as specified in
      this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, rent, share, trade or give away any of
      your personal information unless we believe we are required to do so by law or
      have a good faith belief that such access, preservation or disclosure is
      reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal
      process or governmental request, (b) enforce the <a href="TermsOfUse.aspx">Terms of Use</a>, including investigation
      of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address
      fraud, security or technical issues, (d) respond to user support requests, or
      (e) protect the rights or property of Faves, its Users or the public.</p>

    <p>User's personal
      information collected by Faves may be stored and processed in the United States
      or in any other country in which Faves or its agents maintain facilities. By
      using Faves’ software and/or website, you consent to any such transfer of
      information outside of your country. Faves reserves the right to transfer
      your personal information in the event of a transfer of ownership of Faves,
      such as an acquisition by or merger with another company. In such an event,
      Faves will notify you before information is transferred and becomes subject
      to a different privacy policy.</p>

    <p>Like most websites, Faves
      requires cookies to function properly. Cookies are small data files that
      are sent to and reside on a User's computer and identify you as a unique User.
      This identification helps us better understand our user base, refine our
      software and website and simplify our User’s experiences. We believe our
      cookies improve the quality of our services, however, you can reset your
      browser so that it refuses all cookies, or notifies you when a cookie is being
      sent.</p>

    <h4>Controlling Your Personal
      Information</h4>

    <p>As a Faves User, you
      can modify your personal information at any time by accessing the "My Account
      " section of the website. You can terminate your account at any
      time by emailing <a href="mailto:admin@faves.com">admin@faves.com</a>.
      We typically deactivate accounts within two business days of such requests. You
      should be aware, however, that residual copies of your personal information may
      remain stored on our systems even after the deletion of the information or the
      termination of your account.</p>

    <h4>Security</h4>

    <p>Your Faves account is
      password-protected. We take reasonable precautions to protect our Users'
      information, use industry standard measures to protect information that is
      stored within our database and limit the access to your information to those
      employees who need access to perform their job function.</p>

    <h4>Emails and Opt-out</h4>

    <p>Registered Users may opt-out of Faves initiated email by clicking "Email Settings" under the "My Account" link and following the instructions therein. Registered users cannot currently opt-out of peer-initiated email.
      </p>
    <p>
      The only Faves email sent to Unregistered Users is peer-initiated. Unregistered Users may opt-out of peer-initiated email by clicking the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of a received email.
    </p>
