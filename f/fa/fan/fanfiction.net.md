**Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites**

FanFiction.Net allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within FanFiction.Net. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on FanFiction.Net. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see. 

FanFiction.Net does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. 

You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. FanFiction.Net's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites. Any data obtained by third-party ad servers subsequently shared with FanFiction.Net is maintained and dealt with by FanFiction.Net in accordance with this privacy policy.
