This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the [Fanjoy Terms of Service. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Privacy](https://fanjoy.co/pages/terms) Policy have the meaning given to them in the Fanjoy Terms of Service.

_Information   You  Provide_.   We  collect  information  you  provide  when  you  use  the  Service  or  otherwise communicate with us. If you register an account with us, we will collect the information you provide, such as your name, email address, and phone number.
