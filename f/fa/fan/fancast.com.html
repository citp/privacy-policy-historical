						<p>
							Welcome to Fancast.com, a service of Comcast Interactive Media and its affiliates
							(collectively, "Comcast," "we," or "us"). This statement
							discloses the privacy practices for this website only, including an explanation of:
						</p><ul>
							<li>
								the categories of personally identifiable information about you that may be collected;
							</li>
							<li>
								how the information is used;
							</li>
							<li>
								the categories of persons or entities with whom the information may be shared; the choices
								are available to you regarding collection, use, and distribution of the information;
							</li>
							<li>
								how you can opt in or out of Fancast promotional e-mail;
							</li>
							<li>
								the kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration
								of information;
							</li>
							<li>
								how you can review and request changes to the information;
							</li>
							<li>
								how we notify visitors and users of this website of changes to this privacy statement; and
							</li>
							<li>
								the privacy policies that apply to subscribers to each Comcast product and service.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p></p>
						<p>
							Questions regarding this statement should be directed to Comcast by emailing us at the email
							address located in the Contact Us section of the website, or by sending a notice by U.S. Mail
							to Comcast Interactive Media, LLC, One Comcast Center, 1701 John F. Kennedy Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA  19103-2838
							Attention: Fancast.com Privacy Feedback.
						</p>
						<h2>
							Information Collection and Use
						</h2>
						<p>
							A special note about children: Comcast does not knowingly collect personally identifiable
							information from children under the age of thirteen and does not wish to collect any such
							information. Federal law requires website operators who collect personal information from
							children under the age of thirteen to first get parental consent. Children should always get
							permission from their parents before sending any information about themselves (such as their
							names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers) over the Internet, to us or to anyone else.
						</p>
						<h3>
							What categories of personally identifiable information do we collect?
						</h3>
						<p>
							The information collected by Comcast through use of the Fancast website falls into two categories: (1) information voluntarily
							supplied by visitors to and users of the website and (2) tracking information recorded as
							visitors and users navigate through the website. Some of this information is personally
							identifiable information, but much of it is not. Personally identifiable information is
							information that identifies a particular person.
						</p>
						<p>
							To make use of some features on our website, such as submitting a video, or viewing videos
							with content that would be rated more restrictively than PG-13 visitors and users need to
							register and provide certain information as part of the registration process. We may ask, for
							example, for your name, e-mail address, street address, zip code, and, if you wish to
							automate payments, financial account information. We might also request information about
							your residence, television, and computer, for example, in order to process your request for
							new service or make changes to existing service. In addition, we may ask you for information
							about your interests in television viewing, sports, personal finance, the performing arts,
							and the like. The information you supply will help us to offer you more personalized
							features, complete the particular function of the website you are using, and tailor our
							website to your interests to make it more useful to you. Our systems will remember some of
							this information the next time you log in and use our website, but you can always reset the information in My Fancast.
						</p>
						<p>
							The more you tell us about yourself, the more value we can offer you. Supplying this
							information is entirely voluntary. But if you choose not to supply the information, we may be
							unable to provide you with the products and services we make available to other users of and
							visitors to our website. And you will not be able to order selected products or services, or
							automate payments, over our website unless you provide certain personally identifiable
							information about yourself. When you submit any personally identifiable information over this
							website, Comcast (i) will use the information for the purposes described at the time you
							submit it (for example, your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address provided
							while ordering one of our products or services will be used in connection with the processing
							and fulfillment of your order) and (ii) may use the information to contact you to make you
							aware of other products and services of interest. Of course, if you want to remain completely
							anonymous, you're still free to take advantage of the publicly available content on our
							website without registration.
						</p>
						<h3>
							What categories of persons or entities do we share personally identifiable information with?
						</h3>
						<p>
							We consider the personally identifiable information contained in our business records to be
							confidential. We may sometimes disclose personally identifiable information about you to our
							affiliates or to others who work for us. We may also disclose personally identifiable
							information about you to service providers and vendors, and to others who provide products
							and services to us. For example, when you use certain functions on this website you may
							notice that the website actually collecting or processing the information may be other than a
							Comcast website. We may be required by law or legal process to disclose certain personally
							identifiable information about you to lawyers and parties in connection with litigation and
							to law enforcement personnel. For example, we may be required by law to disclose personally
							identifiable information about you without your consent and without notice in order to comply
							with a valid legal process such as a subpoena, court order, or search warrant.
						</p>
						<h3>
							What do we do to personalize your use of this website?
						</h3>
						<p>
							To help make our website more responsive to the needs of our users and visitors, we use a
							standard feature of browser software called a "cookie." We use cookies to help us
							tailor our website to your needs, to deliver a better, more personalized service, and to
							remember certain choices you've made so you don't have to re-enter them.
						</p>
						<p>
							We use two kinds of cookies: (i) temporary or "session"-based cookies that contain
							certain information about a user's or visitor's use of our website at a particular time and
							(ii) "persistent" cookies that contain certain account-related information about a
							registered user's use of our website. Session-based cookies are automatically disabled or
							deleted when a user of or visitor to our website closes his or her browser software at the
							end of session. Persistent cookies remain stored on a registered user's computer system until
							he or she disables or deletes them. You may read about enabling, disabling, and deleting
							cookies at www.comcast.com at any time by searching for "cookie" and clicking on
							the link for the topic you wish to read. Of course, if you set your browser not to accept
							cookies or you delete them, you may not be able to take advantage of the personalized
							features enjoyed by other visitors to and users of our website.
						</p>
						<p>
							The cookies we use don't directly identify visitors to or users of our website as particular
							persons. Rather, they contain information sufficient to simplify and improve a visitor's or
							user's experience on our website. For example, we may use session-based cookies to track the
							pages on our website visited by our users. We can build a better website if we know which
							pages our users are visiting and how often. Or, we may use persistent cookies to simplify
							access to a user's account information over our website, for example.
						</p>
						<p>
							In connection with the standard operation of Fancast's systems, certain non-personally
							identifiable information about visitors to this website is recorded. This information is used
							primarily to tailor and enhance visitors' experience using the website. We may use this
							information in an aggregate, non-personally identifiable form to, among other things, measure
							the use of our website and determine which products and services are the most popular with
							website visitors.
						</p>
						<h3>
							Where do we permit visitors and users to opt in or out of promotional e-mail related to Fancast?
						</h3>
						<p>
							You may choose to receive, or not receive, promotional e-mails about Fancast by going to the Internet web page located at www.fancast.com/preferences and following the instructions there.  Please note that if you have otherwise opted in to receiving promotional email from Comcast related to a different product or service, for example, a different Comcast website or your Comcast high speed Internet account,  then you will have to visit that Comcast website separately in order to opt-out of promotional emails related to that site or service.
						</p>
						<h2>
							Other Websites
						</h2>
						<p>
							To make our website more valuable to our visitors, we may offer some features in conjunction
							with other providers. Our website may also include links to other websites whose privacy
							policies and practices we don't control. Once you leave our website by linking to another one
							(you can tell where you are by checking the address --known as a URL-- in the location bar on
							your browser), use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the
							operator of the website you're visiting. That policy may differ from ours. If you can't find
							the privacy policy of any of these websites via a link from the site's homepage, you should
							contact the website directly for more information.
						</p>
						<h2>
							Security
						</h2>
						<p>
							All information gathered on our website is stored within a Comcast-controlled database
							accessible only to Comcast and its specifically authorized contractors and vendors. However,
							as effective as any security measure implemented by Comcast may be, no security system is
							impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the complete security of our database, nor can we guarantee
							that information you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the
							Internet. If you don't want us to know any particular information about you, don't include it
							in anything that you submit or post to this website or send to us in e-mail.
						</p>
						<h2>
							Changes to Information
						</h2>
						<p>
							You may review and change information that you provide to us through this website by
							returning to the pages where you entered it, and reviewing or changing the information
							directly.
						</p>
						<h2>
							Changes to this Privacy Statement
						</h2>
						<p>
							We may change this privacy statement from time to time. If we change this privacy statement
							at some point in the future, we'll post the changes on our website and by continuing to use
							the website after we post any changes, you accept and agree to this privacy statement, as
							modified. Of course, our use of information gathered while the current privacy statement is
							in effect will be consistent with the current statement, even if we change that statement
							later.
						</p>
						<h2>
							Privacy Policies for Other Comcast Products and Services
						</h2>
						<p>
							This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for this website only. If you are a
							subscriber to one of our Cable, High-Speed Internet, and Digital Phone products and services,
							please note that separate privacy statements apply to each of these products and services.
							You may also view these privacy notices at www.comcast.com at any time by searching for
							"privacy" and clicking on the link for the privacy notice you wish to read.
