# Privacy Policy | FantasyPros

**Last updated:** May 24, 2018

At Marzen Media LLC d/b/a FantasyPros.com (“FantasyPros”, “we”, “us”), we are committed to you and to protecting your privacy rights. We only collect and track the minimum information necessary to provide you with an enhanced user experience while visiting our website, FantasyPros.com (referred to as the “Website”), and using our associated mobile apps. Our website and mobile apps are collectively referred to as the “Service”. 

**What information do we collect?**

_Personal Information_

FantasyPros offers a variety of free content and tools that do not require any sort of user registration, therefore no information is gathered from you. However, in order to enhance your experience on our site, subscribe for premium membership, and access certain areas of our site, FantasyPros may require you to register for an account. 

When you register for a FantasyPros account, you are asked to provide your name and email address in order for us to contact you and allow for account recovery in the event that you forget your password. If you choose to register or connect using your Facebook account, you grant us access to your Facebook account’s associated name and email address only. We do not store any other personal information from your Facebook account. 

_Types of Personal Data We Collect_

FantasyPros collects Personal Data about you when you provide it directly to us, when third parties such as our business partners (e.g. companies with whom we integrate our Service), service providers (such as our advertising service providers) provide us with Personal Data about you, or when Personal Data about you is automatically collected in connection with your use of our Service. We collect the following Personal Data from you in connection with the Service:

  * Transaction Information: information related to transactions you conduct on the Service, including when you subscribe or sign up for a special offer, and your interactions with the Service (for example the functionality you use and the links clicked on the Service). This information does not include financial information. 
  * User Account Information: information that identifies you to the Service, such as your user name, email address, password, and IP address. For example, we use this information to authenticate you when you log in to the Service, and use the IP address to help maintain your web session security and account preferences while using the Service.

**How we protect your information.**

We implement a variety of security measures to ensure the security of your personal information on our systems. Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of employees who have special access rights to such systems.

To ensure compliance with the latest security technology, we recommend using one of the following browsers and keeping them updated with the latest version. Each of these browsers can be downloaded free of charge: 

  * Google Chrome: <https://www.google.com/chrome/>
  * Mozilla Firefox: <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/>



To ensure the highest level of security available today, we encrypt all Website communications with a secure 256-bit certificate.

Alternately, it may not be securely transferred through your web browser to our servers.

When you submit information over the Internet to any website or entity, the information passes through multiple networks and systems. Unfortunately, not all of these systems are under our control, and information may be intercepted. 

While we do our best to protect your information, FantasyPros cannot ensure or warrant the security of your information that you transmit to us due to those circumstances. You use our Website and Service at your own risk. 

Additionally, by voluntarily posting anything in a public area of the Internet, including our Website or Service, you are making that information publicly available to others. You should always exercise caution when publicly disclosing any personal information. 

Your personally identifiable information is stored in our secure database. E-mail addresses are securely stored with our e-mail management partner, MailChimp. Your password is encrypted using a 256-bit hashing algorithm. 

Select employees of FantasyPros may have access to your information but are only allowed to use it for diagnostic or customer service purposes. 

**You can request your information be removed from our systems at any time.**

You can have your data removed from our systems at any time by requesting an account deletion. This will remove your name, email address, and any other information stored in our systems. However, for legal and reporting purposes, your transaction history will be saved but will not be associated with you in any way. 

To have your information removed from our systems, please [contact us](https://support.fantasypros.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we will assist you.
