<h3>PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
<p>1. PROTECTING PRIVACY AND APPLICATION OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY</p>
<p>1.1 Tennis Australia Limited (Tennis Australia) is the governing body of tennis in Australia. Tennis Australia organises a number of tennis events including, without limitation, the Australian Open and Australian Open Series events. Tennis Australia also manages and promotes various tennis programs, including without limitation, ANZ Tennis Hot Shots, Cardio Tennis and the Free Tennis Days.</p>

<p>1.3 In Australia, tennis programs, events and activities are implemented and conducted by a number of different tennis organisations across the country. Accordingly, Tennis Australia has developed this privacy policy to apply to each Australian Tennis Organisation (ATO) as detailed below.</p>
<p>1.4 For the purpose of this policy, each of the following is an ATO:</p>
<p>Tennis Australia,<br>

Affiliated Organisations, being those organisations (other than Member Associations, Regional Associations and Affiliated Clubs) which are affiliated to Tennis Australia from time to time in accordance with its constitution,<br>

<p>1.7 It is important to note that only tennis organisations that are affiliated with Tennis Australia can be an ATO. If you choose to deal with a non-affiliated tennis organisation, this privacy policy will not apply.</p>
<p>1.8 Tennis Australia may, from time to time, review and update this privacy policy to adapt to changing business practices, and to take into account new laws and technology.
