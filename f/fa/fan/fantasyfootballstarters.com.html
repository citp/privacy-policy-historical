Privacy Statement of Ready-Set-Go Fantasy Sports, LLC ("RSGFS")
</p>
<p class="style2">
RSGFS collects personal information, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address or telephone number. RSGFS may also collect demographic information, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites. Information collected by RSGFS may be combined with information obtained from related entities.

</p>
<p class="style2">
If you choose to sign up for a paid subscription service, we will collect additional personal information, including your credit card number and billing address, in order to bill you.
</p>
<p class="style2">

Some RSGFS services may request that you create a social nickname, which is the name you will be known by to others in those public places. You may select a different social nickname at any time. You can also choose to create an optional public profile, containing information about yourself - such as your hobbies and interests. Any information you choose to enter in your public profile will be visible to other users of RSGFS sites and services; and when you interact with other users, a link to your public profile may be displayed. Please keep in mind that if you disclose personal information through RSGFS, this information may be collected and used by others. RSGFS cautions you against providing personal information to strangers online, which they may use for illegal or harmful purposes.
</p>
<p class="style2">

RSGFS may collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the links you click and other actions taken within RSGFS. We also collect certain standard information that your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring Web site addresses.
</p>
<p class="style2">

Certain RSGFS services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company. If you register for or use such services, both RSGFS and the other company may receive information collected in conjunction with the co-branded services.
</p>
<p class="style2">

Use of your Personal Information
</p>
<p class="style2">

RSGFS collects and uses your personal information to operate RSGFS and deliver the services you have requested. These services may include the display of customized content and advertising based upon the information RSGFS has collected.  Any use of such information will remain subject to the limitations of this privacy statement.
</p>
<p class="style2">

RSGFS does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. RSGFS may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your personal information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. RSGFS does not use or disclose sensitive personal information, such as race, religion, or political affiliations, without your explicit consent.
</p>
<p class="style2">

We may occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. We will only provide those companies the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.
</p>
<p class="style2">

RSGFS may access and/or disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on RSGFS or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of RSGFS or related entities; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of RSGFS services or members of the public.
</p>
<p class="style2">

Security of your Personal Information
</p>
<p class="style2">

RSGFS is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
</p>
<p class="style2">

RSGFS is intended for users of all ages. Children may visit these general audience areas of RSGFS and provide personal information, which will be collected, used and disclosed as described is this Privacy Statement.  We encourage you to talk with your children about communicating with strangers and disclosing personal information online. 
</p>
<p class="style2">

Use of Cookies
</p>
<p class="style2">

RSGFS uses "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
</p>
<p class="style2">

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize RSGFS's pages, or register with RSGFS sites or services, a cookie helps RSGFS to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, preferred email address, and so on. When you return to RSGFS, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the RSGFS features that you customized.
</p>
<p class="style2">

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the RSGFS services or Web sites you visit. 
</p>
<p class="style2">

Use of Web Beacons
</p>
<p class="style2">

RSGFS Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that allow RSGFS to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. RSGFS may include Web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or RSGFS Newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.
</p>
<p class="style2">

RSGFS may also place Web beacons from third parties on our site in order to compile aggregated statistics and to help determine the effectiveness of our joint promotional or advertising campaigns. RSGFS prohibits Web beacons on our site from being used by third parties to access your personal information.
</p>
<p class="style2">

Enforcement of this Privacy Statement
</p>
<p class="style2">

If you have questions regarding this statement, you should first contact RSGFS via e-mail.  We will do our best to promptly address your concerns.
</p>
<p class="style2">

Changes to this Statement
</p>
<p class="style2">

RSGFS will occasionally update this Privacy Statement to reflect company and customer feedback. When RSGFS posts changes to this Statement, you will see the word "updated" next to the Privacy Statement link on the front page of RSGFS. If there are material changes to this Statement or in how RSGFS will use your personal information, RSGFS will prominently post such changes prior to implementing the change. RSGFS encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how RSGFS is protecting your information.
</p>
