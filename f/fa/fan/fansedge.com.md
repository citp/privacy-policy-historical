## The Way We Use Information

We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order to complete that order, which includes sending you order confirmations, shipping notices, and contacting you if we have any questions about your order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.

We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order only to ship the product and to confirm delivery. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.

We offer gift-cards so you can personalize a product you order for another person. Information you provide to us to create a gift-card is only used for that purpose, and it is only disclosed to the person receiving the gift.

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. We use minimal identifying information for the customer testimonials we receive. This includes first name, city, and state. When we choose a testimonial to be shared, we contact the customer first for explicit permission to post the comments and identifying information. You will always have the ability to choose to keep your testimonial private. We appreciate your feedback.

You can register with our website if you would like to receive regular coupons as well as updates on our new products and services. Information you submit on our website will not be used for this purpose unless you fill out the registration form, or opt in to receive this information during the checkout process. You may opt-out of email newsletters and promotions at any time, through the link provided in the email, or by logging into your account. Please allow up to 10 days for your information to be removed.

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.

No personally identifiable information will be shared with vendors, like Google, unless a user specifically opts-in to do so.

We may contact you by mail to provide you with information on new products and services or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please let us know by writing to us at the address provided below.

You may receive mailings from other reputable companies. You can, however, have your name put on our do-not-share list by writing to us at:

FansEdge, Inc.  
Attn: Security Department  
725 Landwehr Road  
Northbrook IL 60062 

We will share required information to the necessary government law enforcement agencies in the course of an investigation, as required by law. When permissible, we will inform you that we are providing this information.

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without notifying you of our intent beforehand, and also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

## Our Commitment To Data Security

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

We use cookies to store visitors preferences, record session information, such as items that consumers add to their shopping cart, record user-specific information on what pages users access or visit, alert visitors to new areas that we think might be of interest to them when they return to our site, record past activity at a site in order to provide better service when visitors return to our site, customize Web page content based on visitors' browser type or other information that the visitor sends. All cookies in use are highly secure, and do not store highly sensitive information, such as your credit card number.

In addition, third party companies may be placing and reading cookies, or using web beacons to collect information, in the course of advertising or promoting their products on our website.

Third party vendors including Google, may use cookies to serve the badge and ads based on a user's prior visits to FansEdge.com 

Users may opt out of Google's use of cookies by visiting the [Google advertising opt-out page](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).

## Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, and to comply with the FTC, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are at or under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13. All our contests and promotions are only available to people 18 and over.

If you believe that an underage member of your family, or an underage person you are responsible for, has registered or made a purchase at our website, please contact our customer service immediately at  877-965-3955 .

We reserve the right to suspend or cancel any order we know or suspect was placed by an underage person. We reserve the right to require identification to prove that an order is from a person over 18.

## How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information

You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by logging into the account you created upon registration. We use this procedure to better safeguard your information.

You can change your FansEdge account information any time you like by going to [Access your account](https://web.archive.org/AccountMenu.aspx). From here you can click [ Log into account](https://web.archive.org/Login.aspx) and enter your email address and password. You can then access the Update My Account page and make changes to your information.

If you do not have an account — for example, if you do not have an email address — you can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by calling us at 877-965-3955 or sending us a request to [ Service@CS.FansEdge.com ](mailto:Service@CS.FansEdge.com) that credibly shows the error.

To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
