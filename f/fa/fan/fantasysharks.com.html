FantasySharks.com, Inc. gathers two types of data about users: (a) personal
information, which individual users provide (i) when registering as a member of <i>FantasySharks.com</i>,
our free flagship site, and (ii) voluntarily at certain other points, such as
contests or surveys; and (b) tracking information, which is automatically
collected about all visitors to our sites.
</font></font></p><p><font face="arial, helvetica, ms sans serif, sans-serif" size="2"><font face="arial, helvetica, ms sans serif, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Personal Information</b><br>
Personal information is gathered in several places on our web sites. We will
always provide a secure area of our sites for you to enter your information, but
if you prefer, you may talk offline to a customer service representative and
provide the required information over the telephone or via email.
</font></font></p><ul><font face="arial, helvetica, ms sans serif, sans-serif" size="2"><font face="arial, helvetica, ms sans serif, sans-serif" size="2">
  <li><b>Registration</b><br>
    Currently, we do not require users to become members of FantasySharks.com in
    order to have access to our free commentary, analysis and news, but if you'd
    like to receive one or more of our free email newsletters, we require you to
    register to become a member. In order to register, you'll have to supply us
    with your email address.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </li><li><b>Message Boards and Chats</b><br>
    We provide message boards and chats for discussion of various topics.
    Although any user of FantasySharks.com may read messages posted to the
    boards, only FantasySharks.com subscribers are permitted to post on the
    boards. No additional personal information is required to post on the boards.
    Please note that information you post to a message board or chat will be
    available for any user of that service to read, and is no longer private.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </li><li><b>Surveys/Polls</b><br>
    At certain times, you may be asked to participate in surveys, which are
    generally aimed at obtaining general information. Because information
    obtained in these surveys is connected with individual subscribers and is
    used internally to better market our services, participation is voluntary.
    In addition, some columnists will on occasion take polls of their readers.
    Such polls are solely for the editorial use of the individual columnists,
    and participation is voluntary.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </li><li><b>Contests and Purchases</b><br>
    We sometimes offer contests in which certain personal information is
    required for registration, for purposes of verifying the entrants'
    identities and notifying the winners. If the contest is being administered
    by a third party, this information will be disclosed to that third party. We
    also require shipping and billing information in order to fulfill online
    purchases of tangible items, such as books and videos.</li>

<p><b>Tracking Information</b><br>
Tracking data consists of both individual and aggregated tracking information
and is automatically gathered using "cookies".
</p><ul>
  <li><b>What is a "cookie"?</b><br>
    A cookie is a small data file containing information, such as a user's login
    name, that is written to the user's hard drive by a web server and used to
    track the pages visited. The individual information gathered in this manner
    is used for internal purposes only, such as accessing a member's account
    information. We also use the information on an aggregate basis, to track the
    readership of stories and analyze traffic patterns on our site.
    <p>You can control your browser's settings regarding cookies by selecting
    "Internet Options" or "Preferences" in the menu bar of
    your browser. This will allow you to prevent your browser from accepting new
    cookies, have your browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or
    disable cookies altogether. However, because cookies allow you to easily
    navigate our web sites without having to constantly reenter your User Name
    and password, we recommend that you leave them turned on.
    </p><p>&nbsp;</p>
  </li><li><b>Tracking by our Advertisers</b><br>
    In addition to cookies placed by FantasySharks.com, advertisers and
    advertising vendors that serve ads onto our web sites may use their own
    cookies or other tracking technologies. We cannot be responsible for the
    privacy policies or practices of any such advertisers and vendors. The
    privacy policy of FastClick, our primary third-party ad server, can be found
    <a href="http://fastclick.com/about/privacy.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
    FastClick collects certain non-personally identifiable information in order
    to better target advertising to you. If you would like to opt-out, click <a href="http://www.fastclick.com/about/opt-out.html" target="_blank">here</a>,
    and FastClick will change your cookie to one that does not contain a unique
    user ID number, which will prevent FastClick from collecting any information
    from your use of the Internet.</li>

FantasySharks.com, Inc. uses information obtained from its users as stated in
this Privacy Policy, and to enhance users' experiences on our sites. As a

emergency. Tracking information is used to create aggregate reports on user
