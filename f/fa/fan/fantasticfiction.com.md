## Children's Privacy

The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to citizens of the European Union and contains specific rules designed to boost the protection of children’s personal data. It restricts the age at which data subjects can lawfully give consent, and regulates the way online services obtain children’s consent. 

Under the GDPR, the default age at which a person is no longer considered a child is 16, but it allows member states to adjust that limit to anywhere between 13 and 16. 

Fantastic Fiction does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under their country's age of consent, or knowingly allow such persons to register. 

Fantastic Fiction membership is not intended for children under 16. If you are under 16, please do not sign up to become a member of Fantastic Fiction or send any information about yourself to us, including your name or email address. No one under age 16 should provide any personal information to Fantastic Fiction. 

If a parent or guardian learns that we have collected personal information from a child under age 16 without their consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about your child, please contact [webmaster@fantasticfiction.com](mailto:webmaster@fantasticfiction.com)
