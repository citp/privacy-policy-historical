Like most websites, we use cookies to improve your user experience by enabling our site to “remember” you and your settings for your next visit. 

A cookie is small text file, stored on your computer or mobile device. It will contain an anonymous identifier so that our site can recognise you when you use the same browser to return. 

Cookies do various tasks on our site, like remembering you’re logged in, remembering that you’ve voted in our polls and whether you’ve chosen to hide or show comment replies.
