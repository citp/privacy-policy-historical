            <li><b>Service Providers:</b> We use other companies, agents or contractors ("Service Providers") to perform services on our behalf or to assist us with the provision of services to you.

            <li><b>Promotional offers:</b> We may offer joint promotions or programs that, in order for your participation, will require us to share your information with third parties.

            <li><b>Business transfers:</b> In connection with any reorganization, restructuring, merger or sale, or other transfer of assets, we reserve the right to transfer information, including personal information, provided that the receiving party agrees to respect your personal information in a manner that is consistent with our Privacy Policy.</li>

        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>Fantasy Cruncher uses reasonable administrative, technical, physical and managerial measures to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft and unauthorized access, use and modification. For example, we may utilize Secure Sockets Layering, an industry-standard protocol for certain of your transmissions to us, in order to encrypt certain personal information that you send to us through the registration and sign up process.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, no security system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of your information and cannot assume liability for improper access to it. By using our service, including our website and user interfaces, or providing information to us through any means, you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the Fantasy Cruncher service.</p>

        <p>In order to provide you with ease of access to your account and to help administer the Fantasy Cruncher service, we implement technology that enables us to recognize you as the account holder and provide you with direct access to your account without requiring you to retype any password or other user identification when you revisit the Fantasy Cruncher service. You can choose not to take advantage of this feature on your computer by unchecking the box "Remember me on this computer" when you login on the website. To remove access to your Fantasy Cruncher account from your devices: (a) visit "My Profile" <span class="href">(<a class="legal_link" href="https://www.fantasycruncher.com/YourAccount">https://www.fantasycruncher.com/YourAccount</a>)</span> (note, deactivation may not occur immediately) or (b) delete your Fantasy Cruncher settings from your device (steps vary by device and the option is not available on all devices). You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account access information and for restricting access to your computer or device through which you access your Fantasy Cruncher account. Where possible, users of public or shared devices should log out at the completion of each visit. If you sell or return a computer or Fantasy Cruncher ready device, you should log-out and deactivate the device before doing so. If you do not maintain the security of your password or device, or fail to log out or deactivate your device, subsequent users may be able to access your account, including your personal information.</p>

        <h3>Transfer of Information</h3>
        <p>Given that the Internet is a global environment, using the Internet to collect and process information necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis. Therefore, by using Fantasy Cruncher, you acknowledge and agree to the transfer of your information outside your country of residence to any country (including the United States) where we have facilities or engage Service Providers. You understand that the countries to which we may transfer information may not have as comprehensive a level of data protection as in your country, although your personal information will continue to be protected in accordance with the standards described in this policy.</p>
