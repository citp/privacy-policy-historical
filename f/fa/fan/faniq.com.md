# FanIQ - Privacy Policy

**Please Note: FanIQ has made changes to its Privacy Policy, effective October 28, 2009.**

Date of Last Revision: October 28, 2009

FanIQ's Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how we collect and use the personal information you decide to share, and help you make informed decisions when using FanIQ, located at www.FanIQ.com, any related online applications, or the mobile versions thereof, and its directly associated domains (collectively, "FanIQ" or "Website").

By using or accessing FanIQ, you are accepting the practices described in our Privacy Policy. FanIQ takes your online privacy very seriously and we are dedicated to providing you with the richest and most enjoyable sports and social experience online. If you have any questions, concerns, or comments regarding our Privacy Policy, please email us at [admin@faniq.com](mailto:admin@faniq.com).

### The Information FanIQ Collects

When you visit FanIQ you provide us with two types of information: (1) personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected by us, and (2) Website use information collected by us as you interact with FanIQ.

When you register with FanIQ, you provide us with certain personal information, which may include your name, your email address, your hometown, your favorite teams, your gender, your age, photos, your blog URL, and any other personal or preference information that you choose to disclose.

When you enter FanIQ, we collect your browser type and IP address. This information is gathered for all FanIQ visitors. In addition, we store certain information from your browser using "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We use session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in. These cookies terminate once the user closes the browser. By default, we use a persistent cookie that stores your login ID (but not your password) to make it easier for you to login when you come back to FanIQ. You can remove or block this cookie using the settings in your browser if you want to disable this convenience feature.

When you use FanIQ, you may set up your personal profile, form relationships, send messages, initiate fan actions, perform searches and queries, form groups, set up events, add applications, and transmit information through various channels. We collect this information so that we can provide you with the best and most personalized sports and social experience possible. We typically retain this data for a reasonable period of time to enable you to view prior actions or messages.

If you choose to use our invitation service to tell a friend about FanIQ, we will ask you for information needed to send the invitation, such as your friend's email address. We will send your friend an email in your name inviting him or her to visit FanIQ, and may send up to two reminders to them. FanIQ stores this information to send invitations and reminders, to register a friend connection if your invitation is accepted, to allow you to see invitations you have sent, and to track the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us through to request that we remove this information from our database and we will do so within a reasonable period of time.

Please know that you post user content on the Website at your own risk. All information posted on FanIQ is public and can be viewed by other users. As with any content posted on the Internet, content posted on FanIQ may be available on FanIQ or any other website long after it is deleted by the user. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of user content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your user content. Additionally, please be aware that whenever you voluntarily post public information on FanIQ, that information can be accessed by the public and can in turn be used by those people to send you unsolicited communications.

By using FanIQ, you are consenting to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States. Any improper collection or misuse of information provided on FanIQ is a violation of the FanIQ [Terms of Use](http://www.faniq.com/terms.php) and should be reported to us immediately.

### How FanIQ Uses Information Collected 

When you register with FanIQ, you create your own personal profile. Your profile information, as well as your name, email and photo, are displayed to other FanIQ users. We may occasionally use your name and email address to send you notifications regarding new services offered by FanIQ that we think you may find valuable.

Profile information is used by FanIQ primarily to be presented back to and edited by you when you access the service and to be presented to other FanIQ users when they search for you. In some cases, other FanIQ users may be able to supplement your profile (e.g., initiating fan actions, commenting on your blog, giving you gifts, etc.). As with other websites, your profile information may be made available to third party search engines. This is primarily so your friends can find you and send a friend request. FanIQ allows for the RSS syndication of its public content and may allow third parties to access publicly available FanIQ content through an application programming interface (API). However, all FanIQ user passwords will be kept strictly private.

FanIQ may send you service-related announcements from time to time through the general operation of the service. For instance, if a friend sends you a new message or challenges you to a competition, you may receive an email alerting you to that fact. FanIQ may also use your email address to send you highly relevant updates, breaking news alerts or newsletters on your favorite teams. We believe this will provide you with a much better sports and social experience than anywhere else. You may, however, opt out of such emails by changing your user preferences. FanIQ does, however, reserve the right to send you notices about your account even if you opt out of all voluntary email notifications.

FanIQ may use information in your profile without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We do this for purposes such as aggregating how many people in a network like a team or player and personalizing advertisements and promotions so that we can provide you with the best possible sports and social experience. We believe this benefits you. You can know more about the world around you and, where there are advertisements, they're more likely to be interesting to you. For example, if you select your favorite teams in your profile, we might serve you a promotion highlighting tickets to an upcoming game or new merchandise for sale from your favorite team. But we don't tell the ticket or merchandise provider who you are.

Additionally, FanIQ may use your behavioral and activity information on FanIQ in an anonymized or aggregated format.

### FanIQ's Policy on Minors

FanIQ does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register for the Website. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for FanIQ or send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to or on FanIQ. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us immediately at [admin@faniq.com](mailto:admin@faniq.com).

FanIQ recommends that minors 13 years of age or older ask their parents' permission before registering for FanIQ or sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.

### Links

FanIQ may contain links to other websites. We are, of course, not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our Website to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by FanIQ.

### Disclosure & Sharing of Information with Third Parties

FanIQ is about interacting and sharing information with other users over the common bond of sports. When you post information on FanIQ, you are making the choice to share interactions with FanIQ users, both to those known to you personally and to those you may not yet know. However, we will share your information with third parties only in limited circumstances where we believe such sharing is (1) necessary to offer you services that we believe may be relevant and valuable to you, (2) legally required or, (3) permitted by you. For example:

  * We may provide information to service providers, agents, and contractors to help us bring you the services we offer. Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business, such as to host the service at a co-location facility for servers, to send out email updates about FanIQ, to allow users to play games on our Website, to remove repetitive information from our user lists, to process payments for products or services, to offer an online job application process, or to provide search results or links (including sponsored links). In connection with these offerings and business operations, our service providers, agents, and contractors may have access to your personal information for use for a limited time in connection with these business activities. Where we utilize third parties for the processing of any personal information, we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections limiting the use of that information to the FanIQ-specified purposes.
  * If you, your friends, or members of your network use any third-party applications developed for FanIQ, applications may access and share certain information about you with others in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Before allowing any third-party applications on FanIQ, FanIQ requires the third-party partner to enter into an agreement with FanIQ which, among other things, requires them to respect your privacy and strictly limits their collection, use, and storage of your information. However, while we have undertaken contractual and technical steps to restrict possible misuse of such information by such third-party partners, we of course cannot and do not guarantee that all third-party partners will abide by such agreements. In addition, third-party partners may require you to sign up to their own terms of service, privacy policies or other policies, which may give them additional rights or impose additional obligations on you, so please make sure to review these terms and policies carefully before using any third-party partners of FanIQ. 
  * We, or a partner, may sponsor a promotion, sweepstakes, or contest on FanIQ.com. Users may be asked to provide personal information including name, email address, or home address, or to answer questions in order to participate. We may transfer personal information to certain advertising partners that you have explicitly requested to receive information from. It will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the personal information and whose privacy statement will apply.
  * We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We do not reveal information until we have a good faith belief that an information request by law enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal standards. Additionally, we may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the FanIQ service or using the FanIQ name, or to prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies.
  * We may offer stores or provide services jointly with other companies on FanIQ. You can tell when another company is involved in any store or service provided on FanIQ, and we may share customer information with that company in connection with your use of that store or service.
  * If the ownership of all or substantially all of the FanIQ business, or individual business units owned by Sportelligence, Inc., were to change, your user information may be transferred to the new owner. Such ownership changes may include mergers, divestitures, and dissolution. In any such transfer of information, your user information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.



### Third Party Advertising

Advertisements that appear on FanIQ are sometimes delivered (or "served") directly to users by third party advertisers. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. These third party advertisers may also download cookies to your computer, or use other technologies such as JavaScript and "web beacons" (also known as "1x1 gifs") to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. Doing this allows the advertising network to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. In this way, they may compile information about where individuals using your computer or browser saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked. FanIQ does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third party advertisers. However, third party advertisers have no access to your contact information stored on FanIQ unless you choose to share it with them.

This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by FanIQ and does not cover the use of cookies or other tracking technologies by any of its advertisers.

### Changing or Removing Information

Access and control over most personal information on FanIQ is readily available through the profile editing tools. FanIQ users may modify or delete any of their profile information at any time by logging into their account. Information will be updated immediately. Individuals who wish to deactivate their FanIQ account may do so at any time. Removed information may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time but will not be generally available to FanIQ users. For a more detailed description of FanIQ's policy on removed information, please [click here](http://www.faniq.com/terms.php) to see FanIQ's [Terms of Use](http://www.faniq.com/terms.php).

Where you make use of the FanIQ's communication features to share information with other individuals on FanIQ, however, (e.g., sending a personal message to another FanIQ user) you generally cannot remove such communications.

### Security

FanIQ takes commercially reasonable measures to protect FanIQ users' information that is stored within our database, and we restrict access to user information to those employees who need access to perform their job functions, such as our customer service personnel and technical staff. Please note that we cannot guarantee the security of user account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time. If you have any questions or concerns about the security of FanIQ, please contact us immediately.

### Terms of Use, Notices and Revisions

Your use of FanIQ, and any disputes arising from it, is subject to this Privacy Policy as well as our [Terms of Use](http://www.faniq.com/terms.php) and all of its dispute resolution provisions including arbitration, limitation on damages and choice of law. We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy and our [Terms of Use](http://www.faniq.com/terms.php) at any time. Changes will take effect immediately when they are posted on the Website. If we make changes, we will post them and will indicate at the top of this page the policy's new effective date. We encourage you to refer to this policy on an ongoing basis so that you understand our current Privacy Policy. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account.
