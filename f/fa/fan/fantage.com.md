# Welcome to a Fantastic Age!

**Privacy Policy**  
  
  
**1\. What information is collected?**  
We do not ask for any personal information from our users except for their age. Input of age is required so that we can verify which users are under 13 years old. Users under 13 years of age must also supply the email address of a parent or legal guardian. We tell our users not to use any recognizable personal information for their ID. 

**2\. How is the information collected?**  
The only way a child's personal information is collected is directly from the child when he or she registers. No cookies are used to collect personal information. 

**3\. What is personal information used for?**  
Age verification is used solely to determine if a user is under or over 13 years old. No other personal information is collected from the child. Personal information is not provided to third parties. 

**4\. Isn't personal information collected when a user wishes to pay for membership or order products?**  
Only persons 18 or older may pay for membership or order products. Any personal or financial information provided to fantage.com is used solely for payment and shipment purposes. Such information is not stored by our site, but only by our financial institution for the purpose of processing payments. 

**5\. What if a child tries to provide information to other users?**  
All of our chat rooms are strictly monitored with a variety of security provisions. For instance, a chat filtering system automatically blocks personal information such as phone numbers and home addresses. At various times, users may attempt to circumvent our filtering system, or some offensive material may get through. No website can filter personal or offensive material perfectly. However, our filtering system is constantly being updated and refined to provide continually improving security. Moreover, as an added layer of protection, our chat rooms are monitored by fantage.com employees, whose job it is to screen out questions and answers that might supply personal information. Finally, users are actively encouraged to report other users who are bothersome or who ask intrusive questions. 

**6\. Inquiries concerning our privacy policies:** All inquiries concerning the privacy policies of fantage.com should be directed to [support@fantage.com](mailto:support@fantage.com).
