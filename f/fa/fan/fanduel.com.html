To provide security and business continuity for the activities described here, we make backups of certain data, which we may retain for longer than the original data.</p><h2>4. When FanDuel Discloses Information</h2><p><u>4.1</u> We may disclose the information we collect or receive from you to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, agents, or other businesses, or service providers who process your information on our behalf in order to provide or operate the Service.

Legal Bases for Processing Personal Data</h2><p><u>5.1</u>Some laws require companies to tell you about the legal grounds they rely on to process your personal information. To the extent those laws apply, we process your personal information:</p><p class="indented-item"><u>5.1.1</u> Legitimate interests: In many cases, we handle personal data on the ground that it furthers our legitimate interests’ in commercial activities such as the following in ways that are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected individuals:</p><div class="indented-item"><p class="indented-item">(a) Customer service</p><p class="indented-item">(b) Marketing</p><p class="indented-item">(c) Protecting our players, personnel and property</p><p class="indented-item">(d) Analyzing and improving our business</p><p class="indented-item">(e) Processing job applications</p><p class="indented-item">(f) Managing legal issues</p></div><p class="indented-item"><u>5.1.2</u> We may also process personal data for the legitimate interests of our affiliates or business partners, such as to offer special events or contests or assist with marketing.</p><p class="indented-item"><u>5.1.3</u> Processing for the contract: Some of our processing of personal data is to meet our contractual obligations with our players. </p><p class="indented-item"><u>5.1.4</u> Consent: Where required by law, and in some other cases, we handle personal data on the basis of your implied or express consent. </p><p class="indented-item"><u>5.1.5</u> Legal compliance: We need to use and disclose personal data in certain ways to comply with our legal obligations.</p><h2>6. Your Choices</h2><p><u>6.1</u> FanDuel will process your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and as part of that FanDuel provides you with certain choices about how we process your personal information. These choices are set out below.</p><p><u>6.2</u> You can access and update certain personal information FanDuel holds about you at any time by logging into your account via the Service. You can update your marketing preferences and whether or not you would like us to send you newsletters in your account. You can also unsubscribe to marketing emails and newsletters by using the 'unsubscribe' feature in the communication.</p><p><u>6.3</u> We may occasionally send display media to you, in a targeted way, whether through web or mobile browsers or mobile applications. You may opt out of many third parties that support and send this type of targeting advertising by going to www.aboutads.info, and you may learn more about this type of advertising in the below Section titled “Third Party Advertising and Analytics.” You may opt out of tracking for mobile advertising through the settings on most smartphones, and you may learn more about these settings through those mobile device platforms, i.e., Google (here) and Apple (here). (Please note that these companies may change either the way these settings operate, the content or the availability of these pages.)</p><p><u>6.4</u> We may occasionally send you push notifications to your mobile device. You can turn off certain push notifications in the account settings of your FanDuel mobile app. You can also turn off push notifications specific to our Service in the settings on your iOS device, or through the application manager in your Android device.</p><p><u>6.5</u> Subject to some important legal limitations, users in Canada can contact us as described below to make additional requests, such as to request access to, correction or deletion of certain personal information we store; to receive a copy of certain personal information they provided to us in portable form or to request that we share it with a third party; to request restrictions on the use of their personal information; to object to our use of their personal information; or to withdraw consent to use their personal information (which will not affect the legality of any processing that happened before the request takes effect). </p><p><u>6.6</u> For example, Canadian users can contact us to opt out of all processing of their personal information for direct marketing purposes (in addition to the unsubscribe option described here).</p><p><u>6.7</u> Can reach us as described below with any other concerns, requests or complaints regarding our data collection, data use or data transfer. You also have a right to file a privacy complaint with the relevant privacy regulator, but we respectfully invite you to allow us to try to resolve the matter directly. We will attempt to answer your questions and satisfy your concerns in a timely and complete manner. </p><h2>7. Third Party Advertising And Analytics</h2><p><u>7.1</u> Certain ads appearing on our Service are delivered by our advertising partners. Our advertising partners may use cookies and other similar technologies, often in conjunction with unique (anonymous) cookie identifiers, to collect data about your activities and interests, including the technologies described above. Some of these partners may use mobile device identifiers, such as Apple IDFAs and Google/Android Advertising IDs. Doing this allows the ad companies to recognize your computer or device each time they send you an online or mobile advertisement. In this way, the ad companies may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer or device, saw their advertisements and measure your interaction with each ad. This information allows ad companies to deliver targeted advertisements that may be of increased interest to you, both on our Service and elsewhere online. Just as these technologies may be used to target ads on our websites and apps, we, or our advertising partners, may use these same technologies and data points (e.g., mobile identifiers, cookie identifiers, location-based data), through our Service or through other services, to target advertising (for ourselves or other companies) on other sites or mobile apps. Sometimes, these identifiers may be derived from a hashed or encrypted version of personal information such as your email address. We may use this information to measure the performance of our advertising as well, for instance, to evaluate which ads or content our users prefer, or which are most effective. In addition, sometimes we or an advertising partner may tailor advertising to you across different devices.</p><p><u>7.2</u> To learn more and to opt out of the collection of data on our website by third parties (including those described above) for interest-based advertising purposes, please visit <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices">www.aboutads.info/choices</a> or <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.com">www.youronlinechoices.com</a>. Note that because this opt out method may be cookie-based, you will need to opt out again if you update or change your browser, or delete your cookies.
