   3. We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of FanDuel.com and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing User preferences and trends.<br><br>
   4.

<h4>When FanDuel.com Discloses Information</h4>
<p>
We may share your personally identifiable information (such as name or email address) with other, third-party companies for their commercial or marketing use with your consent or as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out.</p><p>

FanDuel.com also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information that FanDuel.com believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our terms and conditions, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to respond to a subpoena, legal order, or official request, to protect the security or integrity of our web site, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of FanDuel.com, our Users or others.

 </p>
<h4>Your Choices</h4>
<p>
You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through FanDuel.com, in which case FanDuel.com may not be able to provide certain services to you.

To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.</p><p>

<h4>Data Security</h4>
<p>
FanDuel.com uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to FanDuel.com and you do so at your own risk.</p>

<p>
The ads appearing on the FanDuel.com site are delivered to Members/Groups by our Web advertising partners. Our Web advertising partners may use cookies. Doing this allows the ad network to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad networks may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. FanDuel.com does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed on the computer of any Member or other user of the FanDuel.com website by the third-party ad servers or ad networks.</p>
