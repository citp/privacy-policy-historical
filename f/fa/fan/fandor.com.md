Last Revised April 26, 2017

This Privacy Policy (" **Policy** ") explains how Our Film Festival, Inc. d/b/a Fandor (" **Fandor** ", " **we** ") collects, uses, and shares information from or about you when you use the Fandor Services. The term " **Fandor Services** " refers to, collectively, our video service, including the selection of films and other audio-visual content, as well as the written and visual content we offer (collectively, the " **Content** ") and our player for viewing the Content (the " **Video Player** "), as well as any other products, features, tools, materials, or other services offered from time to time by Fandor through www.fandor.com website (the " **Fandor Site** "), applications, and other places through which the Fandor Services may be accessed, including websites and applications of Fandor's third-party distribution partners and other websites where users or website operators are permitted to embed the Video Player or the Content.

We provide this information so you can make an informed decision about viewing the Content and using the Fandor Services. By viewing any Content or otherwise using the Fandor Services, whether you are a subscriber, or a visitor who has not subscribed to the Fandor Services, you consent to the collection and use of information from or about you as explained in this Policy.

**INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

_Personally Identifiable Information._ Certain information that we collect can be used to specifically identify you as an individual. We only collect personally identifiable information when you provide it to us. For example, when you register to use the Fandor Services, you give us your full name and email address. To enable your use of certain features of the Fandor Services, we may also collect your birth date, gender, and other information. If you are a paying subscriber, we also collect your billing and credit card information, which includes your billing address. In addition, from time to time, we may collect information that you provide by participating in surveys, promotional offers, or other similar activities.

_Account Data Received from Third-Party Services._ When you register on the Fandor Site or otherwise connect to the Fandor Services through a third-party service (e.g. Facebook), we may collect your user ID and user name associated with that service, your email address, as well as any information you make public using that service. We may also collect information you have authorized the service to share with us.

_Device, Usage and Log Data._ When you use the Fandor Services or view Fandor advertising outside of the Fandor Services, we may also collect certain data that does not tell us specifically who you are. It includes things like your Internet Protocol (IP) address, device, browser and software characteristics (such as type and operating system), location, activity on the Fandor Services including title selections and watch history, page views, ad data, referral URLs, network state, device identifiers or other unique identifiers such as advertising identifiers (e.g., "ad-ID" or "IDFA"), and carrier information.

_Data Collected Through Cookies, Beacons and Other Similar Technologies_

We also collect non-personal information using various technologies, including the following:

  * _Cookies and Local Storage_. We may place a "cookie" on your computer, and we may automatically collect certain information through the use of "cookies". A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, sent to your browser from a website's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. We may use cookies to better understand how you interact with the Fandor Services, to gather usage data and web traffic routing on the Fandor Services, and to customize Content and advertising. These uses will help us generally improve the quality of the Fandor Services. We may collect information through other kinds of local storage and HTML5 local storage, including in connection with features such as volume/mute settings for the Video Player. If you would rather not use cookies or local storage, most browsers give you the option to turn them off, or require your approval before using them to keep information. However, if you choose not to keep information in cookies or local storage, certain features on the Fandor Services may not work as intended.
  * _Web Beacons or Pixels_. In addition to cookies, we may use other technologies such as web beacons or pixel tags. These are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on the Fandor Site or in emails relating to the Fandor Services to collect certain information and monitor user activity.
  * _Mobile Device Identifiers and Software Development Kits ("SDKs")._ We may use or work with third parties who use mobile SDKs to collect information, such as mobile identifiers (e.g., "ad-ID" or "IDFA") and information related to how mobile devices interact with the Fandor Services. An SDK is computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected and related services and functionality to be implemented. A mobile SDK is in effect the mobile app version of a pixel tag or beacon. We may use this technology, for instance, to analyze how you interact with the Content and advertisements and to enable analytics or other features through mobile devices.

**ADVERTISING**

We and our partners display interest-based advertising using information gathered about you over time across multiple websites, devices, or other platforms. Interest-based advertising or "online behavioral advertising" includes ads served to you after you leave a website, encouraging you to return. They also include ads we and our partners think are relevant based on your browsing habits or online activities.

We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you use the Fandor Services. These third parties may use cookies, web beacons, or other means to collect information from or about you, and may use information collected to, among other things, analyze data, determine the popularity of certain content, tailor advertisements, measure advertising effectiveness, and better understand the usage of the Fandor Service and the other web sites tracked by these third parties. Such third parties may collect information from or about you when you view an advertisement, whether or not you click on it, or when you interact with an advertisement. This Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, cookies or web beacons located in third-party ads. We encourage you to check the privacy policies of such third-party advertising companies to learn about how they treat your information.

**OPT-OUT OPTIONS**

You can opt out of some of our uses and disclosures of your information as follows:

  * _Opt-Out from Promotional Emails._ You may opt out of receiving marketing or promotional emails from us by following the "unsubscribe"; instructions in those emails. You may also opt out of such marketing emails by accessing your account and clicking on "Edit Email Preferences." If you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional emails, such as emails about your account, service announcement, or messages about the terms and conditions of your account.
  * _Opt-Out from Online Behavioral Advertising._ Most of the advertisers and service providers that perform advertising-related services are members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA"). If you would like to learn more about the NAI and make choices about their members' use of information from or about you on websites, please click [here](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/).

Some browsers have "do not track" features that make it possible for you to signal that you don not want your Internet browsing activity to be tracked. The Internet community has not reached a consensus on how to best honor these signals, so we do not currently respond to do-not-track requests at this time. Instead, to opt out of the online behavioral advertising, please exercise the opt-out options described above.
