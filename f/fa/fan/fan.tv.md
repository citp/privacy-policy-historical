Version 2.0  
Last revised: May 30, 2013 **

## 1\. General.

This privacy policy (this “ **Privacy Policy** ”) is designed to inform you about the type of information that Fanhattan, Inc. (“ **we** ,” “ **us** ,” or “ **our** ”) may gather or collect from you in connection with your use of this website located at www.fan.tv, our mobile applications (collectively, the “ **Site** ”) and our online service (the “ **Service** ”). It also explains the conditions under which we use and disclose that information, and your rights in relation to that information.

The procedures for modifying or changing this Privacy Policy in the future are discussed in Section 6 of this document. We will alert you by email if this Privacy Policy is revised (if you have given us your email address), so it is important that you register with this Site and notify us if you change your email address.

If you have any questions or concerns or complaints about our Privacy Policy or our data collection or processing practices, or if you want to report any security violations to us, please contact us at privacy@fan.tv.

## 3\. User Consent.

By submitting Personal Data through our Site or Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## 4\. A Note About Children.

This Site is not intended for children under 13. We do not intentionally gather personal data from visitors who are under the age of 13. If a child under 13 submits personal data to Company and we learn that the personal data is the information of a child under 13, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible. If you believe that we might have any personal data from a child under 13, please contact us at privacy@fan.tv.

## 5\. Gathering, Use and Disclosure of Non-Personally-Identifying Information.

We collect both Non-Personally-Identifying Information and Personally-Identifying Information from you. “ **Non–Personally–Identifying Information** ” is information that, without the aid of additional information, cannot be directly associated with a specific person or entity. “ **Personally–Identifying Information** ,” by contrast, is information such as a name, gender, location, biography, email address that can be directly associated with a specific person or entity, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data.

  1. A. **Gathering Non-Personally-Identifying Information.**
    1. i. **Web Browsers.**   Like most site operators, we gather Non-Personally-Identifying Information from you of the sort that web browsers, depending on their settings, may make available. That information includes your Internet Protocol (“ **IP** ”) address, operating system and browser type, and the locations of the web pages you view right before arriving at, while navigating and immediately after leaving this Site.
    2. ii. **Web Cookies.**   A “ **Web Cookie** ” is a string of information that a site stores on your computer, and your browser provides to this Site, each time you submit a query to this Site. We may use Web Cookies to track the pages that you visit during each Site session, both to help us improve your experience and to help us understand how this Site is being used. 

**IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO HAVE WEB COOKIES PLACED ON YOUR COMPUTER, YOU SHOULD SET YOUR BROWSER TO REFUSE WEB COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THIS SITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT CERTAIN FEATURES OF THIS SITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF WEB COOKIES. IF YOU REFUSE WEB COOKIES, YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY.**

    3. iii. **Web Beacons.**   A “ **Web Beacon** ” is an object that is embedded in a web page. It is usually invisible to you but allows site operators to check whether you have viewed a particular web page or email communication. We may place Web Beacons on pages of this Site and in emails we send to you. 

You may not decline Web Beacons. However, they may be rendered ineffective by declining all cookies or modifying your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis.

  2. B. **Use of Non-Personally-Identifying Information.**   We analyze Non–Personally–Identifying Information gathered from users of this Site to help us better understand how this Site is being used. By identifying patterns and trends in usage, we are able to better design this Site to improve your experiences, both in terms of content and ease of use. We link information gathered using Non-Personally-Identifying Information to Personally-Identifying Information.
  3. C. **Disclosure of Non-Personally-Identifying Information.**   From time to time, we may also release the Non–Personally–Identifying Information gathered from Site users in the aggregate, such as by publishing a report on trends in the usage of this Site.



## 6\. Collection, Use and Disclosure of Personally–Identifying Information.

As defined above, Personally-Identifying Information is information that can be directly associated with a specific person or entity. We will only collect Personally-Identifying Information that you knowingly submit to us.

Please choose carefully the information you post on this Site and that you give to other Site users. You are discouraged from publicly posting your full name, telephone numbers, street addresses or other information that identifies you or allows strangers to find you or steal your identity. Despite this prohibition, other people’s information may be offensive, harmful or inaccurate, and in some cases will be mislabeled or deceptively labeled.
