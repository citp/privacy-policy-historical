 **Newsletter**

If you decide to join the newsletter via any of the many sign up forms located throughout this website, then your first name and email address are required. We require your email address in order to send you the emails and we require your first name so that my emails to you will include a friendly personalized note. 

At the bottom of every email I send, you will find a link to unsubscribe. You may unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time. If you are having trouble unsubscribing or would like to be removed from the newsletter, then simply send me an email at shaunna@fantasticfunandlearning.com asking to be removed.

I currently use Active Campaign as my email service provider (read their privacy policy [here](https://www.activecampaign.com/privacy-policy/)). Your data is collected and then passed to them. Tags are used within Active Campaign to track your actions and page visits so that future emails can be better tailored to meet your needs.

Currently, I send a minimum of two emails per week. However, I will occasionally email you about products and other promotions that may be relevant to your interests. 

Free printables are sent directly to your email with a download link via a third party application called Leadpages ([read their privacy policy here](https://www.leadpages.net/privacy)).

Your email and name are never sold or given away to a third party.

All emails you receive are CAN-SPAM compliant. At the bottom of every email, you will find information on how to contact the sender, as well as information on how to unsubscribe.

 **Blog Comments**

Love something you read on my blog? Then leaving a comment is a great way to do that! I personally love hearing your feedback. If you choose to leave a comment on a blog post, then please be aware that the comment is then public and visible to anyone who reads the comment section. Your email address is never shared or disclosed, but your name and comment will be visible to others.

It is highly recommended that you avoid leaving detailed personal information in your comments.

I reserve the right to remove comments deemed as inappropriate, threatening, profane, or spammy without notice.

 **Store Purchases**

Products in the Fantastic Fun and Learning shop on www.preschoolteacher101.com are sold via WooCommerce. Your name, email address, and country are required during the checkout process. This information is required in order to send you the purchased product.

The details you enter are stored by the third party applications. All payments are made through PayPal, which does not store your financial information once the transaction has been processed.

I also sell products via affiliate programs. Each program collects and retains their own data. I do not have access to the personal information that is collected by these affiliate programs. It is best to read their individual privacy policies for more information on how your data is collected and used.

Fantastic Fun and Learning uses Google Analytics to track website performance and user behavior.

Google Analytics does capture anonymous data about location, age, gender, and interests, but I have no way to connect that information and specifically identify you.

A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser.

You can also opt out of the network cookie using those settings or using the Network Advertising Initiative’s multi-cookie opt-out mechanism at: [http://optout.networkadvertising.org](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/). However, these opt-out mechanisms themselves use cookies, and if you clear the cookies from your browser your opt-out will not be maintained.
