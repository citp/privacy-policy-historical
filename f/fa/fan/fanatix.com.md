**1\. WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?**

This Privacy Policy covers Fanatix's treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that Fanatix gathers when you access the Website and/or use some other features of the Service. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Fanatix does not own or control, or to individuals that Fanatix does not employ or manage.

**2\. WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES FANATIX COLLECT?**

The information we gather enables us to personalize and improve our services. We collect the following types of information from our users:

**i. Personal Information You Provide to Us**

We receive and store any information you enter on the Website or provide to us in any other way, including by connecting your Facebook Account. The types of Personal Information collected include your full name, email address, IP address, browser information, username, password and any other information necessary for us to provide the Service, including the usernames and passwords for your accounts and profiles on third-party sites with which the Service interoperates. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as answering questions, sending product updates, and communicating with you about Fanatix's products and services, including specials and new features.

**ii. Personal Information Collected Automatically**

a. We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Website or use another feature of our Service. Fanatix automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested.

b. More generally, our Service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Website and its components. Fanatix only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Website or another feature of the Service so that we can make the Website appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve the Service. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our Service. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use our Service, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, Fanatix never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.

**iii. E-mail Communications**

We often receive a confirmation when you open an email from Fanatix if your computer supports this type of program. Fanatix uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful. We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers.
