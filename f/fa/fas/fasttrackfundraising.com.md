If you choose to submit orders or requests online, you will need to provide us with the necessary fulfillment information through our online order or request form. All personal information you submit to us through FastTrack Fundraising will only be used by us and our third-party suppliers and transactional companies for the purpose of fulfilling your order or request. FastTrack Fundraising may contact you with informational updates and communications, which you may always opt-out of as described below.

When registering online or by phone, campaign organizers need to supply contact information, relevant affiliation(s), and details related to their fundraising campaign. We collect this information from fundraising campaign organizers to assess the organizer's fundraising needs and to respond to them with information relevant to their request.
