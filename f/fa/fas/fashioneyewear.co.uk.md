# Privacy

At Fashion Eyewear we understand that the privacy of our customers is an immense responsibility and one that we take extremely seriously.

**Information and Data**

Fashion Eyewear will only collect information that is voluntarily disclosed to us by you. This can include information such as email addresses, mail address and telephone numbers. This information will be used for order processing and may also be used for security checks and fraud detection. You can request that this information be amended or deleted at any time in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.

Please note that Fashion Eyewear does not hold any payment details or information. All transactions are dealt with independently by SagePay, Google Checkout or Paypal. They will ask for card details or you may need to set up an account, providing payment and address details. These organisations will collect financial transaction information and possibly IP addresses. We do not have access to any of your financial information eg card details from these parties other than the value of goods ordered from us.

Your address will obviously be shared with the relevant delivery service provider currently Royal Mail but in certain circumstances your telephone number may also be given to enhance customer service and aid delivery.

Circumstances may arise when we may need to gather information about your computer to help provide appropriate services or products to you.  The data gathered is solely statistical data, which may be shared with advertisers. 

The facts collected about you are statistical only. No identifying information will be shared about our visitors and how they made use of our site.  No personal details will ever be shared.

We may wish to use certain technology such as web cookies in order to track your activity on our site. This information will allow us to provide information that is relevant to you, enhancing the service we can offer.

Any computer has the option to decline cookies.  Your web browser options include an “enable” button to decline cookies.  It is imperative that you understand by declining cookies you may be limiting your access to sections of our website.

**Our use of information and data**

Fashion Eyewear will aim to only use information provided by you in accordance with the services you request from our website and to enhance your experience with us.  Please also note that we may use information for auditing or market research purposes but this will only ever be within the boundaries of the company. We will never share your information with any other companies unless compelled to do so by legal enforcement authorities such as the Crown Prosecution Service. Non-personally identifiable information (this is not personal information such as addresses) may be shared with partner organisations. 

**Storage of your information**

As previously identified, here at Fashion Eyewear we take the Data Protection Act 1998 very seriously and will always ensure your information is kept secure. Information will be held in either computer records, which will be password protected at all times, or paper records stored in a secure location.  Only a minority of people with specific necessity to access the information will be able to do so. 

Please note that you can, at any time without reason, request to know the information we hold or ask for it to be removed from our records. 

Fashion Eyewear is registered with the Information Commissioner (an independent official overseeing compliance with the Data Protection Act 1998) and therefore meet all aspects of the Data Protection Act 1998.

**Using information to communicate**

Please be aware that we may use the information on file to contact you through email, SMS, or telephone. Please be aware that you can opt out of this at any time. Communication will always be direct from Fashion Eyewear and never a 3rd party organisation. 

Please note that this privacy statement may be updated at any time. We reserve the right to change this privacy policy without notice. By providing any information to Fashion Eyewear you accept our Privacy Policy.
