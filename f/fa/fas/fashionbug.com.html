						<font class="custsvcbodytext">We collect information online when you register at this Site.  This information includes your name, e-mail address and mailing address, and may include your phone number.  We also may ask you for your mailing preferences should you choose to join our mailing list.</font><br>

						<br>
						<a name="useinfo" class="custsvchead2">How Do We Use Your Information?</a><br>
						<font class="custsvcbodytext">CSI collects information from you in an effort to fulfill your requests, and to communicate with you about our company and products. In addition, we may use information about your product interests and purchases to help us improve our Site design and your online experience.&nbsp;<br>
						<br>
						We may combine information you provide with demographic information that is publicly available. We use this combined information to enhance and personalize your online experience with us, and to communicate more effectively with you by e-mail or otherwise.  We also share your information with our affiliates and subsidiaries.  In addition, we may share your information with unrelated third parties as set forth below in the Section titled “How Do We Disclose or Share Information With Unrelated Third Parties?”.</font><br>

						<br>
						<a name="storeinfo" class="custsvchead2">How Do We Store and Protect Your Information?</a><br>
						<font class="custsvcbodytext">All personally identifiable information is transmitted using industry standard secure server technology. CSI uses industry standard efforts, such as firewalls and password protected data sources, to safeguard the confidentiality of your information.  To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to reasonably safeguard and secure the information we collect online. If sensitive data is collected through this Site, CSI will encrypt your personal information before it travels over the Internet using industry standards for secure online transactions.</font><br>

						<a name="mail" class="custsvchead2">Mailing Lists</a><br>
						<font class="custsvcbodytext">When you register with CSI or participate in a contest or promotion online through this Site you may choose to receive e-mails or postal mail from us regarding our company, our corporate information, our products, services, contests, and promotions. From time to time, we may also send you e-mails to help us learn more about your online preferences.

						<br>
						<a name="3rdparty" class="custsvchead2">How Do We Disclose or Share Information With Unrelated Third Parties?</a><br>
						<font class="custsvcbodytext">We may share information with unrelated third parties for a variety of reasons.  For example, we may contract with unrelated third parties to assist us in maintaining and managing our customer and investor information, to fulfill promotions, and to communicate with our customers and investors. We do not authorize any of those third parties to make any other use of your information.  In addition, when we team up with another company to offer or provide products, services, contests or promotions, we and the other company may share our customer databases to identify common customers. We and the other company may also use that existing information to identify future promotional opportunities for you and to fulfill promotional or contractual obligations arising from such promotions. We also may share your information with our other business partners.<br>
						<br>When we offer contests and promotions, or join with other companies to do so, customers who choose to participate in those contests and promotions may be asked to provide personal information to participate. That information may then be used by us and any company offering the contest or promotion to notify winners or to fulfill promotional and/or contractual obligations.  If prior to participating in a contest or promotion you opted not to receive information from us, you may still receive information from or about CSI in connection with the specific contest or promotion if you choose to participate in it. You may opt not to participate in these contests or promotions if you do not want to receive information about CSI or share your information with us and the other companies sponsoring those contests or promotions.<br>
						<br>In the event that CSI’s, our parent’s or any of our affiliates’ or subsidiaries’ businesses or assets are sold, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.<br>
						<br>We may share customer information with law enforcement agencies in the event of a criminal investigation or suspected illegal activity with or without requiring a court order or a subpoena.<br>
						<br>Finally, if we believe that an unrelated third party’s products or services may be of interest to you, we may share your personal information with or disclose such personal information to such outside company so that they can market their products or services directly to you.<br>
						<br>You may opt out of the sharing of information with unrelated third parties as provided below in the Section titled “How Do I Update My Personal Information Or Opt Out of Third Party Disclosure?”.<br></font>
						<a class="custsvctoplink" href="#top">top</a><br>
						<br>
						<a name="updinfo" class="custsvchead2">How Do I Update My Personal Information Or Opt Out Of Third Party Disclosure?</a><br>
						<font class="custsvcbodytext">You may update your registered information at any time.  This includes your name, password, e-mail and postal address.  You may also manage your e-mail formats and opt-out of future unaffiliated third party disclosures of your information (such opt out will not affect disclosures to affiliates or previously completed disclosures to third parties).  To remove your name from the CSI events email reminder, <a href="https://fashionbug.charmingshoppes.com/registration/update_registration.asp#contact" class="custsvcbodytextBold">click here</a>.
