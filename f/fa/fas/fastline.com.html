            <br>
            <br>
            Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this
            notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make
            about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to
            find, we make it available from every page on the Fastline website.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>The Information We Collect </b>
            <br>
            <br>
            This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Fastline website.
            On some pages, you can post information to the website, make requests, and register
            to receive materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages
            include:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Name<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Address<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Email address<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phone number<br>
            <br>
            On some pages, you can submit information about other people. For example, if you
            want to recommend a farmer or equipment dealer to Fastline, you will need to submit
            enough information to enable us to contact them. In this circumstance, the types
            of personal information collected are:<br>
            &nbsp;Name
            <br>
            &nbsp;Phone Number and/or Email address
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Cookies</b><br>
            <br>
            Fastline automatically recognizes some information from the User, employing commonly-used
            "cookies" browser feature. Using cookies, our site will automatically recognize
            your member ID. A cookie is a small data file that the Web Site writes to your hard
            drive. We also use cookies for a number of administrative purposes; for example,
            to store your preferences for certain kinds of information or to store a password
            so that you do not have to input it every time you visit our site. No personal information
            is stored in cookies. A cookie cannot be read by a Web Site other than the one that
            set the cookie. A cookie cannot read any other data off your hard drive, pass on
            a virus, or read cookie files created by other sites. Cookies do not contain any
            information that will enable anyone to contact you by telephone, e-mail, or other
            means. You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. Your ability
            to interact with the Fastline Web Site, however, will be limited.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Registration</b><br>
            <br>
            Most of the Fastline website is available without registration, but in order to
            take advantage of some features, you must register and create a member account.
            Fastline's online registration form requires you to provide your full name, e-mail
            address, postal code, and password for basic services. Some sections of the site may
            be accesible after you provide additional information about yourself.<br>
            <br>
            We hope that, like many users, you will want to provide information about yourself
            so that we can continue to make our Web Site more valuable to you.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>How We Use Information</b><br>
            <br>
            We use the information you provide about yourself only to complete your requested
            transactions. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the
            extent necessary to complete each transaction. With our Equipment Database, we only
            disclose personal information you submit to the other party after you have confirmed
            your want to make contact with them. We use return email addresses to answer the
            email we receive. Such addresses are not shared with outside parties. You can register
            with our website if you would like to receive information about Fastline as well
            as updates on our new services. Information you submit on our website will not be
            used for this purpose unless you fill out the registration form. We will email you
            with messages and advertising which we think will be of interest to you. If you
            do not wish to receive email messages from us, please contact the <a href="javascript:showPopupWindow('Email=webmaster@fastline.com');">
                Web Master</a>. We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design
            our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser
            that X number of users visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number visitors
            filled out our registration form, but we will not disclose anything that could be
            used to identify those individuals.<br>
            <br>
            We do not intend to collect individually-identifiable information from, or market
            our services to, children under 13 years of age. We endeavor to provide a safe online
            environment for users of all ages. We permit only authorized employees or suppliers,
            who are trained in the proper handling of customer information, to have access to
            customer information. Whenever we hire other organizations to provide support services,
            we require them to conform to our privacy standards and to allow us to audit them
            for compliance. We will not reveal customer information to any external organization
            unless we have previously informed the customer in disclosures or agreements, have
            been authorized by the customer, or are required by law. Finally, we never use or
            share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated
            to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out
            or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Opt-Out Features</b><br>
            <br>
            We will remove your name from marketing or other distribution lists upon your written
            request. To tell us you do not want to receive communications from us, such as e-mail
            newsletters announcing new features, contests, or new content, or to tell us you
            do not want to receive communications from a third party that offers a product or
            service that we think would be of value to you, opt out at registration, send an
            e-mail to <a href="mailto:helpdesk@fastline.com">helpdesk@fastline.com</a> or write
            us at<br>

            <b>Information Posted to Our Site</b><br>
            <br>
            When you post information in our equipment database listings, classified listings,
            on message boards or discussion groups, you grant Fastline unrestricted use of that
            material. Please see our <a href="license.asp" target="license">Terms of Use Agreement</a>
            for more information. Users should be aware that personal information voluntarily
            disclosed on message boards and discussion groups can be collected and used by others
            and may result in unsolicited messages to you from other parties.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Our Commitment To Data Security</b><br>
            <br>
            To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use
            of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial
            procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. The personally
            identifiable information we collect is stored within our controlled database and
            we use standard, industry-wide procedures, such as firewalls and SSL (Secure Socket
            Layers) for credit card information. As effective as our security measures may be,
            no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed complete security. When
            you register on our site, you will select a password. You will need your password
            to gain access to your personal information. Your password is a component of our
            security system. As such, it is your responsibility to protect it. Do not share
            your password with any third parties. If your password has been compromised for
            any reason, you should change it immediately by going to My Account section of the
            Web Site.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Our Commitment To Children's Privacy</b><br>
            <br>
            Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason,
            we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know
            are under the age of 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone
            under the age of 13.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information</b><br>
            <br>
            You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online
            and maintain from the My Account section of the website. We use this procedure to
            better safeguard your information. You can update and correct factual errors in
            your profile or in your listings by sending us a request. To protect your privacy
            and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before
            granting access or making corrections, such as verifying your email address.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Policy Statement Changes</b><br>
            <br>
            We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy from time to time without prior
            notice.
