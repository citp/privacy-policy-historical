## 4\. TYPES OF DATA WE COLLECT

Fastly collects Personal Data and Anonymous Data from you when you visit our website, when you send us information or communications, and/or when you download and use our Products or Services. " **Personal Data** " means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data. " **Anonymous Data** " means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data; Anonymous Data does not permit the identification of individual persons. We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below.

### 4.1 Personal Data You Provide to Us

When you create an account on Fastly.com, we will ask you to create a user name and password and to provide us with your email address. In addition, while it is not required, you may provide us with further information, such as your name and address, to complete your profile on Fastly.com. When you purchase services on Fastly.com, we will ask you to provide personally identifiable information ("PII"), including your name, address, phone number and financial information (e.g. your credit card number and expiration date). If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail (e.g., in response to an employment opportunity posted on our website), we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply, and any information that you submit to us, such as a resume. If you choose to send an invitation to a colleague, we will ask for your colleague's email address. We will automatically send that person a one-time email inviting them to visit the site.

### 4.2 Personal Data Collected via Technology

  * **Information Collected by Our Servers:** To make our website, Products and Services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect data from you, including browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (" **IP** ") address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit. This data is aggregated, and isn't personally identifiable.

  * **Cookies:** We also use Cookies (as defined below) and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information and log information from incoming requests. This information includes, but is not limited to, the date and time of the request, what information was requested, the Fastly customer that sent the request, and any errors that occur while processing the request (client, server, or otherwise). "Cookies" are small pieces of information that are sent by our servers in the header of HTTP responses.




When Internet applications (e.g. browsers) process the HTTP response they parse and then store the Cookie on the client computer's hard drive. We may use both session Cookies and persistent Cookies. Session Cookies are removed from the client computer once the internet browser has left the page from which they were served. Persistent Cookies are stored on the client hard drive for longer periods of time (e.g. 30 days) after which they expire. Internet browsers also allow users to manually delete persistent Cookies before their expiration date (usually through the browser settings or configuration panel). We use persistent Cookies to provide a more personal and interactive experience to our users and our configuration application will not function if cookies are disabled by the end user.

  * **Log Files:** As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider ("ISP"), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the website, track users' movements around the website, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Products and Services to our users' needs. For example, some of the information may be collected so that when you visit the website or the Services again, it will recognize you and the information could then be used to serve information appropriate to your interests. This data is anonymized, and we do not link this automatically-collected data to Personal Data.

  * **User Tracking and Analytics:** We use services such as Google Analytics([http://www.google.com/analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/)), MixPanel ([http://www.mixpanel.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20140530072708id_/http://www.fastly.com/privacy/href=%22http://www.mixpanel.com) Tout ([http://www.toutapp.com](http://www.toutapp.com/) and Swiftype ([http://www.swiftype.com](http://www.swiftype.com/)) to track and analyze how our customers use our website and web based configuration application. Google Analytics uses Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the website, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the website. MixPanel is sent usage information directly from out configuration application which is then used to track how our users interact with features and navigate between pages. Tout is a Gmail extension which allows Fastly to know if a sales email, sent to someone who is not yet a Fastly customer, has been read, and the Fastly website has been visited. Swiftype is a search engine that powers our website search, it helps us see what terms users are searching for on our website and what searches are producing results. It ranks searches and also missed searches in terms of how many times a term was searched. Information from these services is not correlated with personal customer information in any way. For more information on the way that these services track user information please visit their respective websites and read the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies.
