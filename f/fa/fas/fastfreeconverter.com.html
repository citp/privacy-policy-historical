                        The Company is committed to protecting your privacy in addition to continually developing
                        technology that will provide you with the most up to date resources for optimal planting and the

                        Company, the web page, its content and materials thereof, and its visitors and customers, in
                        addition to the collection and governing of data. In interacting with the Company web page, you
                        consent to adhere to this Privacy Policy and any and all data practices as outlined within this
                        document. <br>
                        <br>
                        Collection of Personal Information <br>
                        Certain types of personally identifiable information may and will be automatically collected by
                        the Company in regards to both your computer hardware and software. Such personally identifiable
                        information may include: browser type, your Internet Protocol (IP) address, domain names,
                        referring web page addresses and times of access. The aforementioned information that is
                        collected by the Company is used by such to operate the service, maintain the quality thereof,
                        as well as provide general usage statistics of the Company web page for the purposes of
                        improvement. <br>
                        <br>
                        The Company consistently keeps track of any web pages and sections that are visited by our
                        customers within the Company, such that the Company may determine which of its services are of
                        greatest interest. Such data can and will be used to provide customers with content that of
                        which is customized to their needs in addition to advertising to the customers which have also
                        been customized to cater to the customers' needs based upon their behavior on the web page. The
                        Company can and will access the web log analysis software on its server as well as retain the
                        reports for internal usage; in no way will the Company ever use the aforementioned reports with
                        the intention of personally identifying any individual, unless it is in the event of deliberate
                        misconduct and misuse of any of our systems or services. <br>
                        <br>
                        The Company will never, in any way, disclose the email addresses of our customers; such
                        identities are always kept confidential and are never sold to any third parties, such as bulk
                        email advertisers. <br>
                        <br>
                        The Company will never, in any way, disclose other such personal information, nor make it
                        available to the public, including postal mail addresses, phone numbers, or any other such
                        information that of which is gathered in the duration of business transactions with our
                        customers. In the event that English Law requires the Company to disclose any personal
                        information or that the Company feels it is with good faith that such an action would be of
                        necessity, the Company will disclose such information without providing any notice, under the
                        conditions that it is necessary to: (a) abide by any edits of the law or to abide by any other
                        such legal process that of which is served on the Company or its web page; (b) both protect and
                        defend either the rights or the property of the Company; and (c) act under exigent circumstances
                        such that the Company can protect the personal safety of either the users of the Company or the
                        public. <br>
                        <br>
                        Usage of Cookies <br>
                        The Company web page may and will utilize "cookies" for the purposes of personalizing your
                        experience in interaction. A cookie is defined to be a text file which is placed onto your hard
                        drive by a web page serve. A cookie cannot be used to either deliver viruses nor is it capable
                        of running programs without your prior consent. A cookie is uniquely assigned solely to you and
                        is only able to be read by an online server within the domain that of which assigned you the
                        cookie. <br>
                        <br>
                        Cookies primarily serve as convenience to the user, intending to save them time. Its purpose is
                        to inform a web server whether or not you have returned to a specific web page. For example,
                        should you personalize any of the pages on the Company web page or choose to register on such, a
                        cookie will help the Company web page in remembering specific information on any subsequent
                        visits until the cookie is cleared. <br>
                        <br>
                        You are given the ability to either accept or decline cookies. The majority of web browsers will
                        be set to automatically accept cookies, though this can be modified such that the browser
                        declines any cookies in the event that this is preferred. In the event that you choose to
                        decline any cookies, you may be unable to fully experience any of the interactive features that
                        of which the Company services or its web page offer. <br>
                        <br>
                        The FFC Plugin also uses "cookies". We do this for two reasons. First, we use the cookies to
                        store a code designating a marketing or distribution source for the FFC Plugin. This information
                        allows us to properly distinguish between FFC Plugin versions for purposes of analysing
                        retention and usage per marketing or distribution source, on an aggregated basis. Second, the
                        FFC Plugin uses cookies to store user preferences. For example, we use a cookie to record which
                        search engine you have selected as your default provider. Upon accessing the search results
                        pages, cookies may also be placed on your computer, to store your use preferences. We do not
                        use cookies to track your use of the Internet in any other way or to store any
                        personally-identifiable information, and we do not disclose cookie information to third parties
                        (other than as required by legal process). Certain third party partners/service providers may
                        also use cookies in relation to services they provide on or via the FFC Plugin. For example,
                        when you click on a third party offer presented via an Affinity FFC Plugin product, such third
                        party may place an affiliate cookie on your computer to facilitate your interaction with the
                        third party. Please note - third party sites, offers and/or cookies are not controlled by us.
                        Such content is subject to  policies of its respective third party owner (found on the third
                        partyâ€™s website). We strongly suggest that you familiarize yourself with the policies of any
                        third party vendor you choose to engage.<br>
                        <br>
                        
                        
                        Advertisements <br>

                        Information we collect through cookies and other technologies is used to assist us in delivering you relevant 
                        advertisements. 
                        We are working with third-party advertising networks and advertisers who help deliver these advertisements to you. 
                        We do not share your non-public personal information with these third parties, 
                        but we may share anonymized or aggregated information with them to improve the relevancy of the ads you see. 
                        As noted above, these third-party advertising networks and advertisers may 
                        also use cookies and similar technologies to collect and track non-personally identifiable information 
                        such as demographic information, aggregated information, 
                        and Internet activity to assist them in delivering advertising that is more relevant to your interests.
                        <br>

                        Security of your Personal Information <br>
                        The Company will always secure any provided personal information from any unauthorized access,
                        usage or disclosure. The Company will always secure any such provided personal information on
                        servers that of which are within a controlled, secure environment and are protected from any
                        outside or otherwise unauthorized access, usage or disclosure. <br>
                        <br>
                        External Links <br>
                        The Company will provide external links to various other web pages. In no way is the Company
                        responsible for the content and security of any such web page, nor can control the content and
                        security thereof, once you have left the Company web page. The Company is not responsible for
                        the damage or loss of data resulting from any downloaded software, on or off of its web page.
                        You are well advised to, and are responsible to, use a virus scanner for any program downloaded
                        from any such web page prior to installation. <br>
                        <br>
                        Contact Information <br>
                        The Company is always welcome to any comments in regards to this Policy of Privacy. In the event
                        that you feel the Company has failed to adhere to this document, please feel free to contact us.
                        We will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly determine and remedy the problem.
