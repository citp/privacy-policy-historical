 <h1>Your Privacy is Important to Us!</h1><br>
      <b>SECURITY &amp; PRIVACY STATEMENT</b><br>
        Effective November 20, 2002<p></p>
        <br>
      <b>I. General Information About Our Privacy Practices</b><br>
      <p>FastTrack Fundraising Company is strongly committed
        to protecting the privacy of our users and maintaining a secure online
        environment for our online fundraising programs. Our Privacy Statement
        covers our World Wide Web sites found at:</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.FastTrackFundraising.com">http://www.FastTrackFundraising.com</a></p>
      <p></p>
      <p><br>
        This Privacy Statement is effective as of the date written above and is
        designed to meet the following principles and practices:
      </p><ul>
        <li>We fully disclose what information is collected on our sites and how
          we use that information; <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Campaign organizers, participants and supporters who participate in
          our online campaign programs may choose whether they want to continue
          to receive communications from us; <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>We provide our registered campaign organizers with access to their
          account information and the ability to modify that information; and
          <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>We are dedicated to creating a secure environment for user information
          and use an advanced network server security system to safeguard user
          information. </li>
      </ul>
<p>
          In the more detailed description of our privacy practices below, when
          we use the term "you," we are referring to registered campaign
          organizers, participants, supporters and general users of our web sites
          who order campaign products or information from our web sites. When
          we use the term "personal information," we are referring to
          a user's first and last name, address, telephone number, and e-mail
          address.
	  </p>
      <p>Violating our privacy policy is cause for termination
        of your campaign. In addition, FastTrack Fundraising company reserves the
        right to cooperate with municipal, state and federal officials in any
        law-enforcement investigation requiring either personal information or
        reports about lawful or unlawful user activities on this site.</p>
      <p><b>II. FastTrack Fundraising Sections</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>Information Collected Through the Traditional Fundraising Programs</b></p>
      <p>We offer traditional campaign program products
        through FastTrack Fundraising. You may order free samples of products online,
        or request that a consultant contact you to take your campaign program
        order. You may also call our toll-free Order Desk to order your free samples.
        If you choose to submit orders or requests online, you will need to provide
        us with the necessary fulfillment information through our online order
        or request form. All personal information you submit to us through
        FastTrack Fundraising will only be used by us and our third-party suppliers
        and transactional companies for the purpose of fulfilling your order or
        request. FastTrack Fundraising may contact you with informational updates and
        communications, which you may always opt-out of as described below.</p>
      <p><br>
        <b>Information Collected Through FastTrack Fundraising's Website</b></p>
      <p><b>Registration Information</b></p>
      <p>In order to use our services, and/or to receive
        a free information kit, campaign organizers must complete an online registration
        form or call our toll-free number at <b>1.866.432.7838</b>. When registering
        online or by phone, campaign organizers need to supply contact information,
        relevant affiliation(s), and details related to their fundraising campaign.
        We collect this information from fundraising campaign organizers to assess
        the organizer's fundraising needs and to respond to them with information
        relevant to their request.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>III. Specific Information Pratices For All FastTrack Fundraising Sites </b>
      </p><p><b>Order Information</b></p>
      <p>To purchase or order sample campaign products
        through any of our sites, you will need to provide order information (which
        may include credit card information). If you are purchasing campaign products
        from us, once your credit card has been approved by our third-party transactional
        company for the amount equaling the total of the supporter's desired purchases,
        the third-party supplier(s) will receive all relevant purchase details
        (item description, quantity, etc.) needed to fulfill the order. All personal
        information collected during the ordering process is used solely for order
        processing, billing and shipping.</p>
      <p><b>Information Sharing</b></p>
      <p>As detailed above, FastTrack Fundraising company
        does not give your personal information to third parties not associated
        with our campaign products or services. Our third-party suppliers use
        a variety of external delivery companies to ship orders, and a third-party
        firm processes the campaign supporters' credit cards for goods purchased.
        These companies, by contractual agreement with us, are not permitted to
        retain, store or use personally identifiable customer information except
        for order processing and fulfillment. </p>
      <p><b>Log Files and Cookies</b></p>
      <p>Cookies are a small line of text generated
        by a site's server and sent to a user's browser, which enable the browser

      <p>FastTrack Fundraising is to be used only for fundraising
        campaigns. FastTrack Fundraising reserves the right to terminate any campaign,

        of any federal, state or municipal laws, regulations or bylaws. </p>
      <p><b>E-Mail Restrictions</b></p>
      <p>FastTrack Fundraising company is committed to
        responsible Internet commerce. We do not tolerate use of the FastTrack Fundraising
        system for non-campaign e-mails or any e-mail that includes material that
        FastTrack Fundraising, in its sole discretion, deems inappropriate. Sending
        non-fundraising or inappropriate e-mail from an FastTrack Fundraising account
        is cause for immediate termination of access to that account. </p>
