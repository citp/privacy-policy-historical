The voluntary submission of your personal information to these operational providers, including your order or request, will be governed by the specific provider's terms of usage and privacy policies. To facilitate an order or request, we may share your personal information with the operational provider. The operational provider may also share your personal information with us.

<p>Please be advised that when you link to or visit an advertiser's or sponsor's website, we may frame the site with our website logo; however, you will be subject to the privacy policy and terms of usage agreement of that website operator. Mansueto Ventures, its parents, affiliates or subsidiaries will not be responsible for advertiser or sponsor ads and/or links or the content, activities, information collection, use and disclosure practices of the websites of advertisers and sponsors.</p>

<p>We may also provide co-branded services or promotions with certain sponsors or other entities. As a part of these services or promotions, we may request the submission of your personal information through the Website for participation and/or registration. We may also share your information with the sponsor or entity assisting with the service or promotion to fulfill your request. If the co-sponsor or other entity collects your personal information, they may also share your information with us.</p>

<h2><a name="Our_Security_Procedures">Our Security Procedures</a></h2>

<p>We require our employees to protect the privacy of all information collected over the Website. Only employees and supervisors with specific authorization have access to databases containing visitors' personal information. The databases are protected in a secure facility. Credit card information is transmitted via encrypted technology. If we decide to share visitor information with other members of the Mansueto Ventures family, the receiving entity will also maintain the security and integrity of personal information collected over the Website. That said, it is not possible to guarantee the security or integrity of information you disclose online since a sufficiently powerful attack from an unauthorized third party, however unlikely, could compromise your data.</p>

<p>For the convenience of our visitors, we may offer a list of helpful website links provided by other entities and/or persons. Mansueto Ventures does not endorse or recommend, nor is it liable for, the products or services of any websites not owned or operated by Mansueto Ventures. When you visit other websites you will also be subject to the privacy policies and terms of usage agreements, if any, of that website operator.</p>

<h2><a name="Notification_of_Changes_in_the_Privacy_Policy">Notification of Changes in the Privacy Policy</a></h2>

<p>We will review our security measures and Privacy Policy on a periodic basis, and we may modify our policies as Mansueto Ventures deems appropriate. We may also change or update our Privacy Policy if we add new services or features and will post these changes in this policy. We encourage you to review our Privacy Policy on a regular basis.</p>

<h2><a name="CHILDRENS_PRIVACY_POLICY">CHILDREN'S PRIVACY POLICY</a></h2>

<p>Mansueto Ventures respects the privacy of your child and we want to share with you our policies regarding children under the age of thirteen (13). We have developed this site to appeal to visitors over the age of thirteen (13). Although visitors of all ages may navigate through our website, we do not knowingly collect personal information from persons under the age of thirteen (13). If upon notification by a parent or guardian, or discovery by other means, that a child under thirteen (13) has improperly registered on this site by using false information, we will immediately cancel the child's membership and/or participation and delete the child's personally identifiable information from our records.</p>

<p>If we decide to request information from children, we will require verifiable parental consent before we collect any personal information from children under thirteen (13) years of age, except in the following circumstances allowed by law:</p>

<ul>
<li><span>To provide notice and get consent from a parent or guardian;</span></li>
<li><span>To respond to a one-time request from a child, after which we will immediately delete the child's information;</span></li>
<li><span>To fulfill a child's request for a subscription to a online newspaper, magazine or specific information on a regular basis and we will notify the parent or guardian before we contact the child again;</span></li>
<li><span>To protect the safety of a child who is participating on this site; and</span></li>
<li><span>To protect the security or integrity of the site, take precautions against liability, respond to a validly executed subpoena or warrant from law enforcement, or if permitted under other provisions of law. </span></li>
</ul>
