Fashalot makes your shopping experience delightful and rewarding. We at Fashalot helps you discovery Fashion stores near you, their in-store offers, latest collection, and rewards you everytime you walk-in, shop, rate, follow or refer a friend. The rewards are in form of F-Cash. Every F-Cash is equal to Re.1 and can be redeemed for further shopping from F-Cash Partner stores or any free gift. When you use Fashalot you’ll share some information with us. We get that can affect your privacy. So we want to be upfront about the information we collect, how we use it, whom we share it with, and the choices we give you to control, access, and update your information. That’s why we’ve written this Privacy Policy. And it’s why we’ve tried to write it in a way that’s blissfully free of the legalese that often clouds these documents. Of course, if you still have questions about anything in our Privacy Policy, just [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20170606124949id_/http%3A//www.fashalot.com/contact.php). 

There are three basic categories of information we collect:
