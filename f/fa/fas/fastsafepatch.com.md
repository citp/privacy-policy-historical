### What information are you collecting and how are you collecting it?

Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a set of numbers that serve as that computer's "Internet Protocol" IP address. When a visitor requests a page from any Web site within the our network, our Web servers automatically recognizes that visitor's domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address from where you have accessed our site. We use this information to examine our traffic in the aggregate and to investigate misuse of our network, or to cooperate with law enforcement. See also: Will you disclose the information you collect to outside third parties? We do not collect and evaluate this information for specific individuals. Our Web servers do not record e-mail addresses of the visitors.

### What are cookies? 

From time to time, we or its advertisers may send a "cookie" to your computer. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie cannot read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other Web sites. Cookies do not damage your system. We use cookies to identify which areas of our network of Web sites you have visited or customized so the next time you visit, those pages may be readily accessible. Our advertisers may also use cookies to ascertain how many times you have seen an advertisement.

We and our advertisers may use single-pixel gif images, sometimes referred to as web bugs or web beacons, to count Web page accesses and gather some general statistical information. We do not gather personal information through the use of these images. Our advertisers may use single-pixel gifs that can track personal information from cookies that may have been previously placed on a user's computer by an advertiser.

Whenever we request the identity of a visitor, we will clearly indicate the purpose of the inquiry before the information is requested.

What information do you collect when I purchase something?
