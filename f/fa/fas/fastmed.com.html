We do not request, solicit or intend to collect any such information and you should not disclose, enter or upload any such information on the Site.&nbsp; If we discover that such information was disclosed by you, we will exercise commercially reasonable efforts to delete such information; however, we are not liable for any consequences relating to such disclosures of information.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION COLLECTED</strong>. The use and disclosure of certain information varies with respect to the type of information collected, including: (1) Non-Personal Information; and (2) Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
<p>3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Use of</strong><strong> Non-Personal Information.</strong>&nbsp; We use the Non-Personal Information collected through the Site for statistical purposes and for improving the functionality of the Site. This information may also be used to administer your participation in the Site including, without limitation, to troubleshoot and resolve problems with the Site. In general, this information is used internally but we may, from time to time, engage a third party to assist us with these analyses. In those limited cases, disclosure of this information to a third-party is necessary; however, the data is disclosed in the aggregate.</p>
<p>3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Use of</strong><strong> Personally Identifiable Information. </strong>In general, the PII collected is used for purposes of fulfilling your requests for services, or for providing you with information. In all cases, your use of such features and your disclosure of information to FastMed are voluntary.</p>
<p>3.2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>User Comments. </strong>The<strong> </strong>PII we collect is used to manage your access to the FastMed blog. Comments shared will be visible to other users of the Site and, as such, you should exercise caution in disclosing PII within any comment. For additional information, please refer to the “Visibility of User-Generated Content” section below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We, or a third party on our behalf, may also use your email address or other contact information to send you newsletters, alerts, special promotional offers, consumer surveys and other promotional or informational messages. <strong>If you no longer wish to receive such messages, simply click the 'unsubscribe' link that we include at the bottom of every email that we send you.</strong> If a different opt-out mechanism is provided in any individual message, please follow the directions included within that specific email.</p>
<p>We may use or permit third-party service providers and suppliers to conduct marketing activities. In conjunction with such marketing activities, we may provide PII to third parties. However, to the extent any PHI is included within PII collected, our use and disclosure of such PHI will be limited to the permissible uses and disclosures described within the Notice of Privacy Practices, available at www.fastmed.com/policies. If you do not wish your PII to be shared with any third parties for marketing purposes, please contact info@fastmed.com.</p>
<p>3.2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Online Appointment Scheduling. </strong>Use and disclosure of PII provided through the third-party online appointment scheduling system is governed by the appropriate third-party’s separate terms of use and privacy policy.

<p>Though we make every effort to preserve your privacy, disclosure of PII to third parties for non-marketing purposes may occur in certain situations such as: (i) responding to a subpoena, court order or other such request; (ii) responding to a law enforcement agency's request or as otherwise required by law; and (iii) providing PII to a third party if we file for bankruptcy, or there is a transfer of the assets or ownership in connection with proposed or consummated corporate reorganizations, such as mergers, acquisitions, or sales of business units. In all such instances, we will take the utmost care to disclose only that information which is necessary and appropriate under the circumstances.</p>
<p>In the operation of our business we may transfer, process or store your information on third party servers. These servers may be located outside the United States. By voluntarily providing information to FastMed, you expressly consent to such worldwide transfer of your information.</p>
