<h2>Privacy. Plain and Simple</h2>
<p>
  Your privacy is important to you. And it’s important to us  as well. St. Joseph Media, the parent company of <em>FASHION Magazine</em>, will not  sell, distribute, barter or transfer any of your personally identifiable  information to companies, organizations or other parties outside of St. Joseph  Media and its subsidiaries (the St. Joseph Media Companies) without your  permission. It’s that simple.</p>
<p>Want more detailed information about how we protect your  personal information, how you can contact us with questions about privacy or  any other privacy-related concerns? Please read our complete <u>St. Joseph  Media Companies’ Privacy Policy</u>.</p>
<h2>St. Joseph Media Companies: Protecting Your Privacy</h2>
<p>St. Joseph Media and its subsidiaries (the St. Joseph Media  Companies) recognize and respect the privacy of each visitor to our web site  and are committed to protecting your privacy. Our privacy policy is designed to  help you to understand the type of personal information we gather and how we  collect, use and safeguard it. The policy reflects our commitment to take  commercially-reasonable steps to protect the privacy and confidentiality of the  personal information you entrust to us. This policy will continuously be  assessed and updated to reflect new technologies, business practices and client  needs. We reserve the right to alter our privacy policies and will post any  alterations to these principles on our web site in a timely manner.</p>
<h3>What does this policy cover?</h3>
<p>Our privacy policy covers the St. Joseph Media Companies’ treatment  of your personally identifying information when you visit any of the St. Joseph  Media Companies’ web sites or when you use any of the St. Joseph Media  Companies’ services. Our policy also covers the St. Joseph Media Companies’  treatment of any personally identifying information that our business partners  share with the St. Joseph Media Companies and to the personally identifying  information that the St. Joseph Media Companies share with its business  partners.</p>
<h3>What does “personally identifying information” mean?</h3>
<p>“Personally identifying information” is any information  which can, by its nature, identify who you are. Examples of this type of  information are your name, address, phone number and email address.</p>
<h3>What kind of personally identifying information do  the St. Joseph Media Companies collect?</h3>
<p>  The St. Joseph Media Companies collect some personal  information from web site members and from subscribers to its print products.  In addition to name, address (postal and email), telephone number and credit  card information, we may collect demographics and opinions of subscribers or  potential subscribers to our magazines, e-newsletters and web sites. Some of  our sites collect data through on-site tools and applications designed to  assist you, for instance, in wedding planning and other activities. As well  some sites feature sections geared to businesses and professionals where  business-related data is collected. </p>
<h3> How do the St. Joseph Media Companies collect the  information?</h3>
<p>  The St. Joseph Media Companies collect information about  readers and online users through product order forms and surveys, contests,  over the telephone, through the mail, by email, by fax and through our websites. </p>
<h3> How do the St. Joseph Media Companies use the  information you obtain?</h3>
<p>  The St. Joseph Media Companies use the personal information  we collect for three main purposes:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>To       deliver the products and services you have requested from us;</li>
  <li>To       customize our advertising and editorial content;</li>
  <li>To       contact you (or have an authorized third party contact you) about specials       and new products and services.</li>
</ul>
<p>The St. Joseph Media Companies may also use information  about subscribers’ and online users’ interests and preferences as well as feedback  we receive from surveys to improve our products and customer service. The St.  Joseph Media Companies make all commercially-reasonable efforts to ensure that  information is used responsibly and only for its intended purpose.</p>
<h3>What about demographic data that you collect?</h3>
<p> The St. Joseph Media Companies will from time to time  conduct voluntary surveys of visitors to the site to obtain demographic  information about them. Such information may be compiled and shared in an  anonymous aggregate form with advertisers and other third parties but no  personal details will be traceable or associated with specific individuals.</p>
<h3>When do you disclose my personal information to  others?</h3>
<p> The St. Joseph Media Companies will only send personally  identifiable information about you to other organizations when we have your  consent to share the information or:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>We       need to share your information to provide the product or service you have       requested.</li>
  <li>We       need to send the information to organizations who work on behalf of the St.       Joseph Media Companies to provide a product or service to you. (Unless we       tell you differently and unless you consent, these companies do not have       any right to use the personal information we provide to them beyond what       is necessary to assist us.)</li>
  <li>We       respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process.</li>
  <li>We       find that your actions on our web site violate the St. Joseph Media       Companies’ Terms of Use or any of our usage guidelines for specific       products or services. </li>
  <li>We may       disclose personal information to our purchaser or new corporate entity in       the event of&nbsp; a sale, merger or       substantial restructuring of our business.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will obtain your express consent before using or  disclosing your personal information for any purposes not identified in this  policy.</p>
<h3>What happens to the information I provide when  registering for site membership?</h3>
<p> Visitors to the St. Joseph Media Companies’ web sites who  register for membership provide us with a name, password and a working email  address. We use this information to set up your account. We do not sell or  redistribute the membership list and will not send you email at the address you  provide, except if you have subscribed to one of our email products, or for  infrequent announcements, or to resolve issues that may arise with your  account. </p>
<h3>What about the information I post on your public  forums?</h3>
<p>  Depending on the site, the name or email address you  register with us will be posted on our message boards and public forums if you  post comments there. Remember that the information you post can be publicly  viewed. You should exercise caution in deciding what personal information you  will share in these public forums. Members are expected to comply with the rules  governing the message board but we cannot control third parties’ use of  information you may choose to provide in this public forum. </p>
<h3>What happens to information I provide when I enter  one of your contests?</h3>
<p> From time to time, the St. Joseph Media Companies run  contests and promotions associated with our web sites, email newsletters and  magazines. We collect your personal information on contest entries so that we  can contact you if you are a prize winner. If you consent at the time of entry,  we may also contact you with product information from us or from our sponsors,  advertisers or promotional partners. Contests may be co-sponsored by other  companies with their own privacy policies. You should always read the entry  form and contest rules before entering.</p>
<h3>Will I get advertising or promotional messages from  other companies?</h3>
<p> If you are a magazine subscriber: The St. Joseph Media Companies  occasionally make its magazine subscriber lists available to companies who have  products or services of interest to our readers. If you do not wish to receive  these offers and mailings, click on the applicable magazine title for the  mailing address of the applicable Subscription Department. Please accompany  your request with a copy of your subscription mailing label. <br>

<p>If you are an online registrant: You will have been asked at  the time of your registration if you wished to receive messages from our  advertising and promotional partners. If you indicated that you did, you will  receive such messages. If at any time you wish to stop receiving these  messages, simply click the “unsubscribe” link on the email and follow the  instructions and you will be removed from the distribution list. </p>
<h3> What happens to the information I enter using your  “email a friend” button?</h3>
<p>  The St. Joseph Media Companies offer an “email a friend”  function on some online features and tools, allowing you to send email to  friends to inform them about an article they might be interested in reading,  images they may be interested in viewing or tools they may be interested in  accessing. In order for this feature to function, we ask for email addresses  for recipients (so we know who to mail the message to) and for the sender (so  we can tell the recipient(s) who sent the email). We do not store or save these  addresses and you will not receive email or other communications from the St.  Joseph Media Companies as a result of having used this feature. Note that while  the “email a friend” feature cannot be used to send mass “spam” mailings, the St.  Joseph Media Companies have no control over how our visitors use this service  and any email sent through it originates with and is the responsibility of the  sender, not the St. Joseph Media Companies.</p>
<h3>What are cookies and what kind of information do  they gather about me?</h3>
<p>  Cookies are small data files written to your hard drive by  some web sites when you view them in your browser. Cookies and web server logs  are used to collected information in an aggregate or non-identifiable way, and  that information is used to improve your experience as a user on our sites, to  improve the content of our web pages, to monitor the activity of our  advertisements, to monitor traffic to and from our web sites, to customize the  content and/or layout of our pages for each individual visitor and for purposes  of internal review. The information gathered through cookies and web server  logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at  our web site, the web sites visited just before and just after our web site,  browser information and your computer’s IP address. (IP stands for Internet  Protocol. This address is a unique string of numbers that identifies a computer  on the Internet. All resources on the Internet must have an IP address.) This  information is collected on an aggregate basis, meaning that none of this  information is associated with you as an individual.&nbsp; It may be shared with other organizations but  only in aggregate and/or statistical form. Note that companies placing  advertising on our sites have the ability to assign cookies to you in a process  that the St. Joseph Media Companies do not control.</p>
<h3>Why do you ask for my phone number or email on  letters to the editor?</h3>
<p>  The St. Joseph Media Companies’ magazines asks senders of  letters to the editor to include a phone number or email address so we can make  an effort to verify the identity of the sender should we need to do so. We do  not retain this information for any other purpose, nor do we sell, trade or  otherwise disclose it to third parties.</p>
<h3> If I send you an email, will my email become part of  your database?</h3>
<p>  If you choose to correspond with us via email, we may retain  the content of your email messages together with your email address and our  responses. Your email address will not become part of any other data base. We  provide the same protections for these electronic communications that we employ  in the maintenance of non-electronic information, such as that received by mail  and telephone.</p>
<h3> I didn’t sign up on your sites or for your magazines  but I received communications from you. How did you get my name?</h3>
<p>  We may obtain personal information from third parties such  as mailing list owners. Typically, the personal information is provided to us  with specific instructions on how it is to be used. We make all commercially-reasonable  efforts to ensure that such personal information is used only for the purposes  stipulated and that it is subject to strict terms of confidentiality. In the  case of personal information obtained from third parties, we will work with  list owners to fulfill the right of clients to know of the existence, use and  disclosure of their personal information and to provide access to that  information. </p>
<h3>What about other sites that are linked to your site?</h3>
<p>  The sites of advertisers, sponsors and other third-party  services may be accessible from the St. Joseph Media Companies’ sites. These  third parties may collect information for their own promotions and offers and  may have their own privacy policies. The St. Joseph Media Companies are not  responsible for these third-party policies or actions and bear no liability for  them.</p>
<h3> What other steps should I take to protect my privacy  online?</h3>
<p>  There is always the risk that personal information disclosed  online in forum areas or emails may be intercepted, collected and used. The St.  Joseph Media Companies are not responsible if that information is intercepted.  You transmit information to anyone at your own risk. You should safeguard your  passwords from others and take steps to keep your personal information safe. </p>
<h3>How do I find out what personal information you have  about me?</h3>
<p>  If you have questions about the collection, use or  disclosure of your personal information by the St. Joseph Media Companies or if  you want to know whether we have any of your personal information on file you  may contact our privacy officer by one of the methods outlined below. The St.  Joseph Media Companies will respond to your request for access in accordance  with applicable privacy legislation. In the event that we refuse access to you  we will provide you with the reasons for our refusal upon request. Exceptions  may include information that contains references to other individuals,  information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial  proprietary reasons and information that is subject to solicitor-client or  litigation privilege. </p>
<h3>The information you have on file is not accurate.  How do I let you know the correct information?</h3>
<p> The St. Joseph Media Companies will try to ensure that  information about you is accurate, complete and up-to-date. We may update the  personal information in our records from time to time, where current  information is required for the provision of a particular product or service.  Please inform us of any change of name, address or other information. Should  you have questions about the accuracy of factual information we have collected  about you, you will have access to that information in order to verify and  update it. If we have disclosed inaccurate information about you to a third  party, we will be pleased to contact the third party in order to correct the  information.</p>
<h3>I no longer want to receive your email newsletter.  How do I get my name off your list?</h3>
<p> Every email newsletter we send includes an “unsubscribe”  link. Simply click the “unsubscribe” link and follow the instructions and you  will be removed from that newsletter distribution list.</p>
<h3>How do I withdraw my permission to use my personal  information?</h3>
<p>  Subject to contractual and other legal obligations, you are  entitled to withdraw your consent to our use and disclosure of your personal  information. Specifically, if you prefer that we do not use or disclose your  personal information for marketing or promotional purposes please send an email  to privacy@stjosephmedia.com. Please note that your request may take three to  four weeks to implement. We are legally bound to inform you that withdrawing  your consent may preclude us from providing you with certain products and  services.</p>
<h3>What security precautions do you have in place to  protect my information?</h3>
<p>  The St. Joseph Media Companies have organizational, physical  and technological measures in place to ensure commercially-reasonable protection  against the loss, misuse or alteration of personal information under our  control. We review our security practices on a regular basis.</p>
<h3>I have other questions or concerns not answered in  this document. How do I contact you?</h3>
<p> To access your personal information, inform us of changes  you believe need to be made to that information, request that we investigate a  concern you have about our personal information practices or obtain further  information about this policy, please contact:</p>
