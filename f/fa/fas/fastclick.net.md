#### Information Collection and Use

Fastclick.com Inc. (Fastclick) is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. Information collected is in two distinct categories: Member information and aggregated Web User information. This portion of Fastclick's privacy statement applies only to Members of Fastclick. For web user privacy issues regarding the serving of advertisements and the use of cookies, please see the [Web User Privacy Statement](https://web.archive.org/web/20021207211327id_/http%3A//www.fastclick.net/about/privacy2.html).

Members of the Fastclick network include publishers and advertisers involved in advertising campaign transactions. Member information collected includes personally identifiable information that is necessary to conduct business, such as name, phone number, and email address. Payments made to and from Fastclick require the collection of personally identifiable information that may include credit card numbers and bank account information. Phone numbers may be used to contact Members for sales or inventory acquisition purposes. All Member information is collected, modified and stored in a password protected environment. This information is used for service, media delivery, contact, billing and accounts payable purposes. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others. All Member information collection is explicit, voluntary, manually entered by the Member, and can be opted-out. Fastclick will never share information about you without your permission. 

Cookies are used to simplify Member login and to facilitate secure navigation through the password protected areas of the website. Members who choose to reject all cookies may have difficulty navigating the password protected areas of the website depending on the nature of their connection (dynamic IP, proxy server, etc.)

#### Information Sharing

Member information is not shared with any third party outside Fastclick, except for that necessary to conduct business, such as clearing a credit card transaction for an advertising campaign purchase or making an ACH direct deposit to pay a Publisher, or as required by law. The security of Member information is crucial to our success in the highly competitive field of online advertising. Fastclick may, from time to time, use "gallery" pages to identify Publishers and Advertisers by business identity ONLY (e.g. Adcycle.com is a new Member of the Fastclick Network). 

#### Log Files

We record the IP address of new Members at sign-up. This can assist in administering the website and Member accounts, including the possible implementation of "fast-login" and "my Fastclick" features designed to enhance the Member experience. This information is part of the secure member database and is password protected.

#### Links

This website contains links to other websites. Please be aware that Fastclick is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our website and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this website. 

#### Security

This website takes every precaution to protect Member information against loss, misuse or alteration. Access to personally identifiable information is password protected and restricted within our organization on a need-to-know basis.

Every page that involves a form which my contain Member personally identifiable information (such as name, password, address, credit card number and social security number) is encrypted and transferred from the browser to our web server using SSL (https). This means that while on a secure page, such as our login page or our campaign order form, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. 

While we use encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect Member information off-line. All of our Member information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, in locked enclosures, in a restricted access, locked server room. 

#### Special Offers

Our Member email list is used for administrative purposes only. We send all new Members a welcoming email to verify password and user name. Special offers and promotions are made at the website.

#### Site and Service Updates

We may send Members website and service announcement updates by email. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with Members to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone. 

#### Correction/Updating Personal Information

If a Member's personally identifiable information changes (such as your email address) we provide several ways for a Member to correct or update their personal information. The following options are provided:

  *   *   * Contact your account manager 




If a Member no longer desires our service we provide two ways to remove that Member's personal data from our system. All requests to remove a Member from our system will be verified prior to removal to insure the proper identity of the requester. The following options are provided:

  *   * Contact your account manager 




#### Notification of Changes

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on the the first page a Member views after successful login so our Members are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify Members by way of an email. Members will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
