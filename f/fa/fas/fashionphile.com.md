For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “you” and “your” means you as the user of the Services. If you use the Services on behalf of a company, organization, or other entity, then “you” includes you and that entity.

We may collect the following categories of information about you that either directly or indirectly identifies you or could reasonable be used to identify you (collectively, “Personal Information”):

* **Types of Information We Collect**

  * Registration information you provide when you create an account, including your name, email address, telephone number, address, username, password, payment information, and other account information.
  * Information you provide to us when you access or use the Services and each time you interact with the Services or Fashionphile, for example, when you update information in your control panel, communicate with us by telephone or email, and order products or services. Such information includes your payment information. We also store information about the products you purchase or sell through the Services, such as the product information, date of purchase or sale, and information relating to any support issue.
  * Usage, viewing and technical data, including your IP address or device identifier when you use the Services. If you access your account from a mobile device, that mobile device may also provide us with details of your location. Most mobile devices allow you to disable this functionality.
  * Information we receive from third parties, including analytics platforms, social media platforms, and advertising partners. For example, if you access the Services through a third party platform or log-in, we may also collect your email address associated with that third party, and any information you have made public in connection with that service or which the third party shares with partner services.

Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will place cookies when you log on to the Services.

  1. _Information You Provide._ We collect information you provide to us when you register with us, submit products to us, request products, services or information from us, participate in activities through the Services, respond to customer surveys, or otherwise interact with us. Please keep in mind that when you post information on a third party site or platform, the information you provide may be separately collected by the third party site or platform. The information we collect is covered by this Privacy Policy and the information the third party site or platform collects is subject to the third party site or platform’s privacy practices. Privacy choices you make on the third party site or platform will not apply to our use of the information we collect directly through our Services.
  2. _Unique Identifiers._ We collect information through unique identifiers (such as IP address or your mobile device advertising identifier).
  3. _Cookies._ We use “cookies” and other technologies to collect data that enable us to better understand and improve the usability, performance and effectiveness of our Website. Cookies are files sent to your browser and stored on your computer.

Fashionphile uses this information to understand traffic and downloads on our Website, enabling us to improve the Website, provide the best online experience possible, and improve our customer service. We use the following types of cookies on our site: 
    * _Strictly Necessary Cookies_ \- These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around our Website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the Website and remembering which files you have marked for backup.

    * _Other Technologies_ \- We may also use other Internet technologies, such as web beacons or pixel tags and other similar technologies, to deliver or communicate with cookies and analyze your use of the Services.

  4. _Third Party Analytics. We use third parties’ analytic and tracking tools to better understand who is using the Services, how people are using the Services and how to improve the effectiveness of the Services and their content, and to help those parties serve more targeted advertising to you across the Internet or help us serve more targeted advertising to you. Those third party companies may use cookies, pixel tags or other technologies to collect and store certain information, such as time of visit, pages visited, time spent on each page of the Services, device identifiers, type of operating system used and other website(s) you may have visited. They might combine information they collect from your interaction with our Services with Personal Information they collect from other sources.

Like many services, Google Analytics uses first-party cookies to track user interactions, as in our case, where they are used to collect information about how users use our site. This information is used to compile reports and to help us improve our Website. The reports disclose website trends without identifying individual visitors. You can opt out of Google Analytics without affecting how you visit our site – for more information on opting out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites you use, visit this Google page:<https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout>.   _
