    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective on January 1st, 2013</p>

    <p>
        This privacy statement describes how fasterstrongerpc collects and uses the
        personal information you provide on our Web site: <a href="http://fasterstrongerpc.net">fasterstrongerpc.net</a>.
        It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and
        how you can access and update this information.
    </p>

    <h2>Collection and Use of Personal Information</h2>

    <p>
        As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in
        log files. The information in the log files include your IP (internet
        protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or Shaw
        Cable), the type of browser you used to visit our site (such as Google
        Chrome, Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox), the time at which you
        visited our site and which pages you visited throughout our site.
    </p>

    <p>
        We may collect personal information at various times when you use our website or plugin. The more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able to customize your experience. Your participation is voluntary and you have the choice not to disclose any information that we request.
    </p>

    <h3>The types of information we gather:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Information you provide: </b>We receive and store any information you enter on fasterstrongerpc.net or give us in any other way. You provide most such information when you use the fasterstrongerpc or bundled plugins. For instance, if you register for an account with us, we may collect your name, email address, country of origin, and, if you choose, your nickname, telephone number, website, company, and title. If you download and install the plugin, we collect any information voluntarily provided by you during the installation and registration process, which can include demographic information such as gender, age, occupation, household income, zip code and country. Demographic information may be correlated to web usage information collected during your use of the service. In addition, you might provide us with personal identifying information, such as mobile telephone number, when you communicate with us by phone, e-mail or otherwise, or complete a questionnaire, subscription form or a contest entry form. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing and improving our services, delivering targeted content and advertisements that may be of interest to you, and communicating with you.</li>
        <li><b>Automatic information we collect from the plugin: </b>When you use fasterstrongerpc plugin, we may collect information about the websites you visit and the advertisements that you see on those websites, the searches you perform using search engines, the ways in which you use various features, and the pages you view (especially social media pages). For example, we may collect information about page views, impressions and clicks, as well as similar web usage information. For every webpage you view while using the plugin, our software transmits and stores information associated with your Internet Protocol (IP) address, which may include a domain name, the full URL of the webpage you are visiting, general information about your browser; general information about your computer's operating system; your Licensor cookie number or other identifying alphanumerical information enabling Licensor to identify your computer; and the date and time the above information is logged. All of this above information may be logged together in a single data string for each webpage you visit. Each string is logged in our database in the chronological order received from our users. In addition, we may collect information about what cookies are stored on your computer, which enables Licensor to determine which websites you have visited in the past. Although this information may contain some personal identifying information, Licensor does not use it to determine the identity of individual users or correlate it to your email address or other personal identifying information that you give us or our affiliates, except as required by subpoenas, court orders, investigations or other legal requirements. When you download the plugin, and at times during your use of the site, we may transmit Licensor cookies to the hard drive of your computer. We may also automatically collects information about the online advertisements that are displayed on the websites you visit - specifically, the text, source, and URL of the online ad - and the terms you choose when you use search engines to search the Web. Licensor also may periodically collect usage statistics from users that describe the frequency of use of each feature.</li>
        <li><b>Automatic information we collect from the site: </b>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our site. For example, like many websites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses the Site, when you use the plugin, or when you view advertisements and other content served by or on behalf of Licensor on other Web sites. Examples of the information we may collect and analyze when you use our website include the IP address used to connect your computer to the Internet; computer and connection information such as browser type, version, and time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system, and platform; the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) clickstream to, through, and from the Site, including date and time; cookie; web pages you viewed or searched for. During some visits to the Site we may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        We do not only collect any identifiable information in order to optimize and improve our website.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you are not yet 18, you are not allowed to use our services. Further, if we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.
