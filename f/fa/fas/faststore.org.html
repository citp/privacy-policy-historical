<p>This privacy  policy (hereafter referred to as "Policy") explains how personally  identifiable information is collected, used and disclosed by Faststore.org  ("we" or "us") with respect to your access and use of Faststore's  online file storage and sharing service located at Faststore.org, (hereafter  referred to as the "Service"), so you can make a well informed  decision about using the Service.<br>
We reserve the  right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time. We will alert you  that changes have been made by indicating on this Policy the date it was last  updated. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to  the email address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this  Site prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to review this  Policy from time-to-time to make sure that you fully understand how any  personally identifiable information you provide to us or collected about you  will be used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="left">What Is Personal Information?</h2>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p>As  used in this Policy, the term "personally identifiable information"  refers to information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a  name, username or email address), or information about that individual that is  directly linked to other specific identifying information. Personally  identifiable information does not include "aggregate" information,  which is data we collect about the use of the Service or about a group or  category of services or users. Data collected in this manner contains no  references to individual identities or other personally identifiable  information. This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use  of aggregate information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="left">What Information Do We Collect?</h2>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

We may also automatically collect certain logistical information in  server logs, including information about how you use various features of the  Service and information regarding the number, frequency and length of each  individual session. We may also automatically collect certain information  through the use of "cookies" when you use the Service.<br>
