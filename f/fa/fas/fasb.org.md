# Privacy Policy

_**Version 1.0 Last updated on December 30, 2009**_

## 1\. OUR COMMITMENT

The Financial Accounting Foundation (FAF), Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) understand how important the protection of your personal information is to you. We are committed to protecting your privacy. We want to make sure you understand how the personal information you provide to us is being used as well as the choices that you have regarding this information. The following policy discloses our procedures surrounding this commitment.

## 2\. SCOPE OF POLICY

This Privacy Policy governs the privacy practices used by FAF, FASB and GASB on our Websites (referred to herein after as the Sites and listed at the end of this policy) as well as their offline data collection, use, and disclosure activities. The FAF, FASB and GASB maintain high standards for the protection and privacy of users of their Sites as well as for those that have offline interactions with the FAF, FASB and GASB. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully as it states how we may collect, use, and disclose personal information about you. Please also read the Terms and Conditions to the extent posted on individual Sites, or areas of Sites, governing your use thereof.

**The Sites may contain links to Websites not under the control of FAF, FASB or GASB and managed by third parties with independent information and privacy practices. We strive to protect your information and suggest you read the privacy policies of the site to which you are redirected before supplying any personal information.** In addition, we may have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties. Accordingly, you should consult these other Websites' privacy policies when accessing or using such other Web pages.

### Changes to this Privacy Policy:

This Privacy Policy is subject to change to adjust to business needs. Whenever there are changes, the modified Privacy Policy will be posted on the Sites and will be effective at that time. Accordingly, it is recommended that you regularly check the Sites for updates to this Privacy Policy; we will provide a version number and date at the top of the document for your convenience. If the changes to the Site or our accommodations are not amenable to you, discontinuance of use of the Websites is recommended.

## 3\. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION

The FAF, FASB or GASB may gather some personal identifiable information from you in both our online and offline processes when it is voluntarily submitted by you. The types of information collected may include but are not limited to your name, email address, phone number, credit card number and billing address, and residential and business postal addresses.

Automatic Collection.

We may collect this information so we can perform effective capacity planning, administer the Site, troubleshoot Website performance, track users' movements in the aggregate, gather demographic information for aggregate use, and accurately document transactions.

The FAF, FASB and GASB collect information online, in the following ways:

  1. Register to use the Site (Not all areas of the Site require you to register to use them.)

It is optional for you to provide other information, but doing so will allow us to provide a more personalized experience for you on the Site.

## 4\. USE OF INFORMATION

    2. When it is inherent in the function you use on the Site, such as posting to a discussion area where your email address automatically appears. 
  3. Supplementing of Information:   
To provide better service to you on the Site, we may conclude it is necessary for us to supplement the information you provide us with information from third-party sources, which would require disclosure of your personally identifiable information to such third parties. 

For Example, if, when you register, you tell us that you are student or faculty member of an accredited institution, we will verify that fact with membership information provided to us by the American Accounting Association or such other party.

Internally, we restrict access to personal information to employees and contractors and agents who need access to the information to do their jobs or perform services on behalf of the FAF, FASB or GASB.1 These employees and contractors are committed to our privacy and security policies.

1Users become authorized after entering the correct User Name and Password, and acceptance on our Site by us. We recommend that you do not divulge your Password to anyone. We will never ask you for your Password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. Also remember to sign out of the Site you are using and close your browser window when you have finished your use of the Site(s).

2Other FAF, FASB or GASB Web destinations may offer premium content and services only to subscribers of a particular program. Access to this premium content may require online registration and enrollment in the program. For many FAF, FASB or GASB Sites, to access restricted content, the registered user must have the appropriate user profile for access to that information. For example, to access the Professional View of the FASB Codification, the registered user profile must indicate that he or she has paid for such subscription.

3The Sites may from time to time work with certain third parties to provide our users with services that use cookies. However, if you adjust your browser in this manner, we cannot guarantee that all applications on the Sites will function properly for you.

4Although the actual activation of the opt-out will happen sooner, there may be distributions already in process that may still be received by you within that 10-day period. Please note that even if you opt out of receiving the types of communications described above, we may still from time to time communicate with you about your account, subscriptions, or operation of our Sites, or as part of a transaction or activity in which you have elected to participate. For example, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send users an email. You cannot opt out of receiving these communications.
