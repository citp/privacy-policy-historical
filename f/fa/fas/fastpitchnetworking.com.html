<h1>Privacy  Agreement</h1>
  
  Last Updated: May 25, 2009<p></p>
<p>
  Your privacy is our top concern. We work hard to earn and keep your trust, so 
  we adhere to the following principles to protect your privacy:</p>
<p>
  • Any sensitive information that you provide will be secured with all 
  industry standard protocols and technology </p>
<p>
  Notice of all changes that materially affect ways in which your personally identifiable 
  data may be used or shared will be posted in updates to our Privacy Policy. 
  If you continue to use the <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> after notice of changes have been sent 
  to you or published on our site, you hereby provide your consent to the changed 
  practices</p>
<p>
  Please read this privacy policy to learn more about:<br>
  1. What personally identifiable information of yours is collected by <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> 
  <br>
  2. How the information is used. <br>
  3. With whom the information may be shared. <br>
  4. How you can access and change your Account information. <br>
  5. What security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration 
  of information collected by <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT -->. <br>
  6. How to contact us. </p>
<p>
  <strong>Information Collection</strong></p>
<p>
  <strong>Registration:</strong><br>
  In order to become a <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> user, you must first create an account on this 
  web site. To create an account you are required to provide the following contact 
  information: name, email address, country, ZIP/postal code, a brief summary 
  of your company, an overview of your competitive advantages, your ideal customers, 
  ideal partners, possible future business purchases and choose a password.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Profile Information:</strong><br>
  Once a user, you may provide additional information to your account including 
  recent press, events you are promoting or attending and more. Providing additional 
  information beyond what is required at registration is entirely optional, but 
  enables you to better promote your business and find new opportunities within 
  the <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> system.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Information about your Contacts</strong><br>
  In order to invite others to connect with you directly on <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT -->, you will 
  enter their names and email addresses (we also provide a contact upload form 
  for bulk invites – see below). This information will be used by <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> 
  to send your invitation to connect on <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT -->. </p>
<p>
  You may also choose to manually enter or upload data about your contacts into 
  the private “My Connections” section of our website. All information 
  entered there will only be viewable by you and will not be searchable by others 
  in the <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> network without your permission.</p>
<p>
  All information that you enter or upload about your contacts will be covered 
  by the same terms of this privacy policy as cover your own personally identifiable 
  information.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Cookies &amp; Log Files:</strong><br>
  Like most web sites, <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> uses cookies and web log files to track site 
  usage. A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer which allows 
  <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> to recognize you as a user when you return to our site using the 
  same computer and web browser. Unfortunately, if your browser settings do not 
  allow cookies, you will not be able to use our website. Like the information 
  you enter at registration or in your Profile, cookie and log file data is used 
  to customize your experience on the web site.</p>
<p>
  One type of cookie, known as a “persistent” cookie, is set once 
  you’ve logged in to your <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> account. The next time you visit 
  the <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> web site, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you 
  as an existing user so you will not need to log in before using the service. 
  In order to access or change any of your private information (like a credit 
  card number), however, you must log in securely again with your password even 
  if your computer contains your persistent cookie. Additionally, if you log out 
  of the <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> site you will need to re-enter your password the next time 
  you visit in order to log in to your account. Another type of cookie, called 
  a “session” cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to the 
  <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> site. Session cookies expire after a short time or when you close 
  your web browser.</p>
<p>
  Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when you visit the <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> web site we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you 
  came and the site to which you are going when you leave <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT -->. We also 
  receive the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer (or the proxy server 
  you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type 
  of web browser you are using, as well as the name of your ISP. This information 
  is used to analyze overall trends to help us improve the <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> service. 
  The linkage between your IP address and your personally identifiable information 
  is never shared with third-parties without your permission or except when required 
  by law.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Viewing Other Activiy on Your Profile</strong><br>
  <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> offers our Platinum Members the ability to view who has recently 
  visited their profile. The service, in the spirit of business networking, allows 
  them the unique ability to reach out to someone who may have an interest in 
  their product or service. Similar to walking into a ‘storefront’, 
  the Platinum Member has the ability to reach out to the ‘customer’ 
  and offer their assistance. </p>
<p>
  <strong>Web Beacons:</strong><br>
  We may allow other companies (although not presently), called ad networks, to 
  serve advertisements to <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> users. Ad networks include third party ad 
  servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms. <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> 
  may “target” some ads to users that fit a certain general profile 
  — for example, “web designers looking for accountants in Tampa, 
  FL.” </p>
<p>
  To deliver these ads properly, <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> may include a file, called a web 
  beacon, from these ad networks within pages served by <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> so the networks 
  may provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for advertisers 
  as well as to target ads to you while you visit other websites.<br>
  Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from 
  the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit or set their 
  own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.</p>
<p>
  These general targets may also be used by ad networks to display targeted ads 
  on other websites as a substitute for random, irrelevant ads. You will never 
  see additional ads as a result of being a <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> user and <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> never 
  provides personally identifiable information to any advertiser nor any third 
  party.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Children: </strong></p>
<p>Children are not eligible to use our service and we ask that minors (under 
  the age of 18) do not submit any personal information to us or use the service.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Information Use</strong><br>
  <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> is an online and offline service committed to helping professionals 
  network and market their business effectively at one centralized location. The 
  personally identifiable information you choose to provide on this site is used 
  to help you describe yourself and your company to others. Other information, 
  that does not personally identify you as an individual, is collected by <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> Brands, LLC from the site (such as, by way of example, patterns of utilization) 
  and is exclusively owned by <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT -->. This information can be utilized by 
  PROskore at its sole discretion.</p>
<p>
  <strong><!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> Communications:</strong><br>
  <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> will communicate with you through email, direct mail, telephone, 
  mobile phone, IM and fax. These may include a series of promotional and informative 
  emails regarding new features and services provided by <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT -->. Please be 
  aware that you will always receive certain emails from <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> related to 
  the proper functioning of your account, such as email notices when another user 
  requests to connect with you. <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> may send you promotional information 
  unless you have opted out of receiving such information. </p>
<p>
  <strong>Customized Content:</strong><br>
  Information you provide at registration or in your Profile section is also used 
  to customize your experience on the web site. For example, when you login to 
  your account we may partial information about you and your company on our homepage 
  when people log-in. The intent (obviously) is to provide you with immediate 
  and maximum exposure opportunities. </p>
<p>
  Additionally, many users upload third-party logos to their profiles, press releases 
  and more. <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> neither endorses nor is affiliated with most of these 
  third-party companies. In most cases, <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> is not affiliated with these 
  companies. If a company feels the logo placed on a profile is in violation of 
  their trademark guidelines, they should contact the profile owner and/or contact 
  <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> directly to have the logo removed. </p>
<p>
  <strong>Information Sharing</strong></p>
<p>
  <strong>Sharing Information With Third Parties:</strong><br>
  <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> takes the privacy of our users very seriously. We will only share 
  your personally identifiable with third parties to carry out your instructions 
  and to provide specific services. For instance, we use a credit card processing 
  company to bill users for subscription fees. These third parties do not retain, 
  share, or store any personally identifiable information except to provide these 
  services and are bound by strict confidentiality agreements which limit their 
  use of such information.<br>
  <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> offers a “public profile” as well as Search Engine Optimization 
  (SEO) features which publish portions of user’s profiles, including “name” 
  and ‘company name’, to the public Internet. Users may opt-out of 
  this feature, however <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> does not warrant how third-party search engines 
  will update their cache.<br>
  We may provide aggregated data about the usage of our services to third-parties 
  for such purposes as we deem, in our sole discretion, to be appropriate. We 
  may segment our users by role (i.e. product managers, vice presidents), industry, 
  geographic location, company. If you would like to be excluded from the aggregated 
  research or products based upon aggregated data about our users’ activities 
  on the site, please email customer service.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Partnering with Other Organizations to Offer Combined Services:</strong><br>
  <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> may partner with other online services to give you the combined 
  results of both services. Whenever we offer such combined services it will be 
  your choice to make use of the combined services or not.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Communications Between Users:</strong><br>
  Many emails you initiate through <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT -->, an invitation sent to a non-user 
  for instance, will list your name in the header of the message. Emails you initiate 
  may also provide aggregate information about your network and your company. 
  Other communications that you initiate through the <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT -->, like a request 
  for contact, will list your name as the initiator but will not include your 
  personal contact information. Your contact information will only be shared with 
  another user if both of you have indicated that you would like to establish 
  contact with each other. Some basic contact information will be provided to 
  our ‘Platinum Users’ to allow them to have a better understanding 
  of who is visiting their profile (i.e. See Who Recently Visited My Profile’).</p>
<p>
  <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> merely provides the User with a platform on which to establish contact 
  with other users, and only provides those technical applications that allow 
  users to contact one another. As regards content, <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> does not take 
  part in any communication between users. If users enter into agreements with 
  one another over <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> websites, PROskore shall not be a contracting 
  party to these agreements. The users alone are responsible for the execution 
  and/or fulfillment of agreements in which they enter with one another. <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> shall not be held liable if users are unable to contact one another over 
  <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> websites regarding such agreements. Furthermore, <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> shall 
  not be liable for breaches of duty in relation to agreements entered into between 
  users.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Point and Rating System</strong><br>
  PROskore uses a credit and rating (‘stars’) system. You may be 
  awarded credits based upon your status within the system (Premium Member, etc…) 
  and/or your use of the system. <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> may adjust your credit balance or 
  rating, change system credit values or modify the credit and rating system at 
  any time at its discretion. Credits have no monetary value and are not redeemable.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Legal Disclaimer:</strong><br>
  It is possible that we may need to disclose personal information when required 
  by law. We will disclose such information wherein we have a good-faith belief 
  that it is necessary to comply with a court order, ongoing judicial proceeding, 
  or other legal process served on our company or to exercise our legal rights 
  or defend against legal claims.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Accessing and Changing Your Account Information</strong><br>
  You can review the personal information you provided us and make any desired 
  changes to the information, or to the settings for your <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> account, 
  at any time by editing the information on your Profile page. You can also close 
  your account through the <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> website. If you close your <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> 
  account, we will remove your name and other personally identifiable information 
  from our publicly viewable data. We may retain certain data contributed by you 
  if it may be necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, or for legitimate business 
  purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, non-personally-identifiable data, 
  account recovery, or if required by law. All retained data will continue to 
  be subject to the terms of the <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> Privacy Policy that you have previously 
  agreed to. To request that we close your account and remove your information 
  from the <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> service, please send your request to info@proskore.com. 
  Please send your request using an email account that you have registered with 
  <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> under your name. You will receive a response to requests sent to 
  info@proskore.com usually within a few days of the receipt of the 
  email.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Security</strong><br>
  In order to secure your personal information, access to your data on <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> 
  is password-protected, and sensitive data (such as credit card information). 
  At the present time, we do not have access to any detailed credit card information 
  (unless provided directly over the telephone or at one of our events), as that 
  is hosted entirely through our third party merchant service gateway ‘Cybersource, 
  Inc.’. </p>
<p>
  <strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong><br>
  <!-- DNT -->PROskore<!-- /DNT --> may update this privacy policy. In the event there are significant 
  changes in the way we treat your personally identifiable information, we will 
  display a notice on this site. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy 
  Policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account.</p>
