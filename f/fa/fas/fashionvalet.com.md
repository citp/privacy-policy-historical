  * · in the event that FVSB sells or buys any business or assets;
  * · if FVSB or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data which we hold about our customers may be one of the transferred assets; or

Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites. 

## **Checking Your Details**

If you wish to verify the details you have submitted to FVSB you may do so by contacting us via the e-mail address or address given below. Our security procedures mean that we may request proof of identity before we reveal information. This proof of identity will take the form of your e-mail address and password submitted upon registration.

We would strongly recommend that you do not use the browser's password memory function as that would permit other people using your terminal to access your personal information.
