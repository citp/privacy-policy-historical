Information Collection

Registration:  
In order to become a Member of the Fast Company Community, you must first create an account on this web site. To create an account you are required to provide your name, email address, country, ZIP/postal code and current job title, and to choose a password.

Public Profile Information:   
Once a Member, any user of the FastCompany.com Website will be able to see your name and current job title, including company name if you provide it; also included, if you add such information to your profile, are your Tags, the first 3 lines of your bio, any degrees you list and 2 additional job titles together with company names, 

Full Profile Information:  
Once a Member, you may provide additional information in the Profile section describing your interests, professional and educational experiences, and networking objectives. Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration is entirely optional, but enables you to better identify yourself to other Members of the FastCompany.com Community and users of the FastCompany.com Website. You may choose to make your Full Profile available to (a) all users of the FastCompany.com Website; (b) only Members of the Fast Company Community; or (c) only your Contacts.

Invitations to Prospective Contacts:  
In order to invite people who are not Members of the Fast Company Community to connect with you directly within the Fast Company Community, you will enter their names and email addresses. This information will be used by us to send your invitation including a message that you write. The names and email addresses of people that you invite will be used only to send your invitation and reminders.

Cookies & Log Files:  
Like most web sites, we use cookies and web log files to track site usage. A cookie is a tiny data file that resides on your computer and allows us to recognize you as a user when you return to FastCompany.com using the same computer and web browser. If your browser settings do not allow cookies, you will be able to use the public areas of the FastCompany.com Website but will not be able to become a Member of the Fast Company Community. Like the information you enter at registration or in your Profile, cookie and log file data is used to customize your experience on the web site.

One type of cookie, known as a “persistent” cookie, is set once you’ve logged in to your FastCompany.com account. The next time you visit the FastCompany.com Website, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing Member so you will not need to log in before using the service. In order to access or change any of your private information, however, you must log in securely again with your password even if your computer contains your persistent cookie. Additionally, if you log out of FastCompany.comyou will need to re-enter your password the next time you visit in order to log in to your account. Another type of cookie, called a “session” cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to FastCompany.com. Session cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser.

Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when you visit FastCompany.com we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave FastCompany.com. We also receive the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, as well as the name of your ISP. This information is used to analyze overall trends to help us improve FastCompany.com. The linkage between your IP address and your personally identifiable information is never shared with third parties without your permission, except when required by law.

Web Beacons:  
We allow ad networks, to serve advertisements to FastCompany.com users. Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms. FastCompany.com may “target” some ads to Members that fit a certain general profile — for example, “product managers in Texas.” We do NOT use personally identifiable information to target ads.

To deliver these ads properly, we may include a file, called a web beacon, from these ad networks within pages served by FastCompany.com so the networks may provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for advertisers as well as to target ads to you while you visit other websites.

Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.

These web beacons may also be used by ad networks to display targeted ads on other websites as a substitute for random, irrelevant ads. You will never see additional ads as a result of being a Fast Company Community Member or a FastCompany .com user. 

In addition, tFastCompany.com uses the technology of DoubleClick Inc. to serve ads only when you visit FastCompany.com. DoubleClick may use non-personal information, such as your state or zip code, in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you while you visit FastCompany.com. In the course of serving advertisements to FastCompany.com, DoubleClick may place or recognize a unique “cookie” on your browser. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by DoubleClick, please click here [link to http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/index.aspx]. Note that when you opt-out of the DoubleClick cookie a special DoubleClick “opt-out” cookie will replace the DoubleClick Ad cookie. If you ever delete the cookies on your browser you will need to again opt-out of the DoubleClick Ad Cookie.

If you opt-out you will lose the potential benefit of receiving ads that are more targeted to your interests.

Children:  
Children under the age of 13 are not eligible to become Members of the Fast Company Community. 

Information Use

The Fast Company Community is an online service dedicated to helping all types of professionals more effectively connect with one another. The personally identifiable information you choose to provide on this site is used to help you describe yourself to other Member and to users of FastCompany.com. Other information, that does not personally identify you as an individual, is collected by us from the site (such as, by way of example, patterns of utilization) and is exclusively owned by us. This information can be utilized by us in such manner as we, in our sole discretion, deem appropriate.

FastCompany.com Communications:  
We will communicate with you through email and notices posted on FastCompany.com. These include a series of welcome emails to help inform new Members about various features of the Fast Company Community. Please be aware that you will always receive certain emails from us related to the proper functioning of your account, such as email notices when another user in your network sends you an opportunity. We may also send you promotional information unless you have opted out of receiving such information. If you wish to opt-out of receiving promotional emails, please send a request to [opt-out@fastcompany.com](mailto:opt-out@fastcompany.com).

Customized Content:  
Information you provide at registration or in your Profile section is also used to customize your experience on FastCompany.com. For example, when you login to your account we will display the screen names of new Members who have recently joined your Contacts List.

Information Sharing

Sharing Information With Third Parties:  
We take the privacy of our users very seriously. We will never sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personally identifiable information to any third parties for marketing purposes. We will only share your personally identifiable with third parties to carry out your instructions and to provide specific services. For instance, we use a credit card processing company to bill users for subscription fees. These third parties do not retain, share, or store any personally identifiable information except to provide these services and are bound by strict confidentiality agreements which limit their use of such information.

We may provide aggregated data about the usage of our services to third parties for such purposes as we deem, in our sole discretion, to be appropriate. We may segment our users by role (i.e. product managers, vice presidents), industry, geographic location and company. If you would like to be excluded from the aggregated research or products based upon aggregated data about our users’ activities on the site, please email [privacy@fastcompany.com](mailto:privacy@fastcompany.com).

Partnering with Other Organizations to Offer Combined Services:  
FastCompany.com may partner with other online services to give you the combined results of both services. Whenever we offer such combined services it will be your choice to make use of the combined services or not. In these cases, your personally identifiable information will only be passed from FastCompany.com to the partner if you choose to use the combined service.

Communications Between Users:  
Many emails you initiate through FastCompany.com, an invitation sent to a non-Member for instance, will list your email address and name in the header of the message. Emails you initiate may also provide aggregate information about your network (for instance how many people are in your network), but will never list the people to whom you’re directly connected. Other communications that you initiate through the FastCompany.com Website, like a request for contact, will list your name as the initiator but will not include your personal contact information. Your contact information will only be shared with another user if both of you have indicated that you would like to establish contact with each other.

Legal Disclaimer:  
It is possible that we may need to disclose personal information when required by law. We will disclose such information wherein we have a good-faith belief that it is necessary to comply with a court order, ongoing judicial proceeding, or other legal process served on our company or to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.

Accessing and Changing Your Account Information

You can review the personal information you provided us and make any desired changes to the information, or to the settings for your FastCompany.com account, at any time by logging in to your account on the FastCompany.com Website and editing the information on your Profile page. You can also close your account through the FastCompany.com Website. If you close your FastCompany.com account, we will remove your name and other personally identifiable information from our publicly viewable data. We may retain certain data contributed by you if it may be necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, non-personally-identifiable data, account recovery, or if required by law. All retained data will continue to be subject to the terms of the FastCompany.com Privacy Policy that you have previously agreed to. To request that we close your account and remove your information from the FastCompany.com Website, please send your request to [memberservices@fastcompany.com](mailto:memberservices@fastcompany.com). Please send your request using an email account that you have registered with LinkedIn under your name. You will receive a response to requests sent to [memberservices@fastcompany.com](mailto:memberservices@fastcompany.com) within three business days of our receiving it.

To protect any data you store on our servers we also regularly audit our system for possible vulnerabilities and attacks and we use a tier-one secured-access data center.
