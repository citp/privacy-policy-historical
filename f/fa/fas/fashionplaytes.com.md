We encourage parents to be involved with all of their child’s online activities.

## Tell-A-Friend Messaging

There are several places on FashionPlaytes.com where kids can send an email or SMS message to a friend telling them about the site or a garment they have designed. The Tell-A-Friend form asks for the sender’s first name and their friend’s email address or mobile phone number. The e-mail address or mobile phone number is used only to send a message with information about FashionPlaytes to the friend. It is not stored by FashionPlaytes or used for any other purpose. 

## Links to Other Sites and Additional Site Features

Some pages (e.g. our games and chat areas) may have the look and feel of being on our site, however the information collected on these pages may not be covered under our privacy statement. All information collected on those sites is owned and controlled by that company’s privacy statement. Our privacy statement does apply to the information collected on these co-branded sites. You should read the privacy statement of our co-branded partner. 

Our Site includes links to other Websites (such as our blog) whose privacy practices may differ from those of FashionPlaytes.

## Web Beacons (Clear Gifs)

Our third party tracking utility company employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). 

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.

## Changes in this Privacy Statement

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. 

We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to how we use Personal Information collected from children under age 13, we will notify parents by email in order to obtain verifiable parental consent for the new uses of the child’s Personal Information.
