(As used in this policy, "online" means using the Internet, including the Website, and related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.)

Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to fasttransitguides.com or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from fasttransitguides.com or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to fasttransitguides.com. 

1.2 Third Party List Information. 

Fasttransitguides.com may collect information from individuals when an individual provides information to a Third Party and fasttransitguides.com subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the Third Party (the "Seller").

This allows fasttransitguides.com to track certain web sites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, fasttransitguides.com might place, with the consent of a Third Party website, a web beacon on the Third Party's website where baseball products are sold. When Joe, an individual listed in fasttransitguides.com's database, visits the baseball website, fasttransitguides.com receives notice by means of the web beacon that Joe visited the baseball site, and fasttransitguides.com would then update Joe's profile with the information that Joe is interested in baseball. fasttransitguides.com may thereafter present offers of baseball related products and services to Joe. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, fasttransitguides.com also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in fasttransitguides.com's database.
