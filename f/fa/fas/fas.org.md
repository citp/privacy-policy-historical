# Federation of American Scientists :: Privacy Policy

[](https://web.archive.org/web/20140209153536id_/http%3A//www.fas.org/member/donate_today.html "Donate")

The Federation of American Scientists (FAS) respects your right to privacy and is committed to maintaining your confidence and trust. We have created the following privacy policy to inform you about the ways in which we collect and use this information.

**Website Usage**

Most areas of our site are accessible without having to provide personal information of any kind. Some of our services do, however, require some form of identification, which the user is free to provide (or withhold) voluntarily.

FAS also collects aggregate website browsing information including (but not limited to) IP address, domain name, page views, and Internet browser. This information is used to improve our website and will not be disclosed to third parties except as necessary to provide site services.

**Cookies**

Like most websites, FAS places a "cookie," or small text file, in the browser files of visitors to our site. This cookie is used to collect website traffic information and does not collect personally identifiable information about a user. Nevertheless, users retain the right to reject our cookie using the settings in their web browser.

**Collection of Personal Information**

FAS may collect personal information when it is voluntarily submitted to [any](http://www.ucsusa.org/) FAS website, such as through donation forms or newsletter sign-up forms. Submission of such information that includes the user's phone number, email, or mailing address implies the user's consent to being contacted by FAS, but we do not share mailing addresses, email addresses, or phone numbers with third parties except as necessary to perform services such as credit card donation processing.

**Communications from FAS**

**

If you have opted to receive email from FAS you may unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link that appears in bottom of all email communications sent by FAS or by sending an email to [fas@fas.org](mailto:fas@fas.org). 

If you have provided FAS with your phone number or mailing address, we may contact you by phone or mail. You can choose not to receive such communications by contacting us at [fas@fas.org](mailto:fas@fas.org), at 202-546-3300, or at our mailing address below.

**Blog Comments**

**

If you disclose personally identifiable information on publicly-accessible areas of an FAS site (such as the [Secrecy News Blog](http://blogs.fas.org/secrecy) or [Strategic Security Blog](http://blogs.fas.org/security)), this information may become public.  FAS does not control the acts of other visitors to its sites, so please be cautious when deciding to reveal personal information on a public area of any site.

**Secure Transactions**

**

FAS appreciates and will accept online contributions. When you join or donate to FAS via our website your donation information is encrypted and transmitted via a secure connection. FAS uses your credit card information only for the purpose of processing your donation. We will not disclose this information except as necessary to process your donation and we do not store it once your donation has been processed.

**Donation Delivery and Refund Policy**

**

All online donors to the Federation of American Scientists will receive an email receipt confirming the donation for tax deductible purposes. FAS Members (donors of at least $50, or $25 for students) will receive a donation receipt and membership information at the Mailing Address provided.

The Federation of American Scientists is a non-profit organization that exists to provide non-partisan technical analysis on international security, science, and technology issues to policy makers, the press, and the public. Refunds of your gift are discouraged. However, if there is a clear error in the amount of payment or payee, please contact FAS within 30 days from the date of donation at 202-454-4694 to resolve.

FAS uses industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving sensitive personal and financial data from our site. Please note, however, that security breaches can occur even if reasonable steps are taken to prevent such breaches; for example, we cannot guarantee that information provided through our sites will not be illegally accessed on our servers or intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.  Please contact us if you believe there has been any breach of the security of our website.
