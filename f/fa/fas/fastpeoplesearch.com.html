<p>Information Provided Directly by You To FastPeopleSearch</p>

<p><strong>Optional Information</strong>. At various other points during your visit to FastPeopleSearch, you may be asked to provide information about yourself. The use of other services which require the input of additional information is completely voluntary on your part.

You may also click the unsubscribe link in the footer of any email. You may also close your account. After unsubscribing or closing your account, we cannot guarantee that you will never receive another marketing mailing from us, because we may obtain your e-mail address in the future through a different e-mail marketing program that you have opted into. Unsubscribing from one marketing list will not automatically unsubscribe a user from all marketing lists. Please note that even if you opt out of receiving promotional e-mails, we may continue to send you electronic service or transactional notifications that are related to your account(s), orders or other services you have requested, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. </p>
<p><strong>Co-branded Areas</strong>. Certain areas on our FastPeopleSearch Applications may be provided to you in association with third parties such as sponsors or advertisers which provide products and or services, (“Co-Branded Areas”). Such Co-Branded Areas will identify the third party. If you elect to register for the products and/or services provided at these Co-Branded Areas, you either will be providing your Personal Information to both us and the third party or we might be providing your Personal Information directly to the third party in order for that third party to fulfill their products and services directly with you. Your Personal Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy as well as the privacy policy and practices of such third party. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those third parties and we suggest you review the individual privacy policies of each company with whom you establish a relationship. You should consult the respective privacy policies of those third party sponsors or advertisers to learn more about their privacy practices. </p>

Additionally, we may disclose your information and/or communications in situations that we believe to be: (i) emergencies involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person or property if we believe that your information in any way relates to that threat; or (ii) your conduct on the FastPeopleSearch Applications or when using the Communication Services that we believe is inappropriate and inconsistent with generally accepted norms of behavior. </p>

Information about our customers and registered users may also need to be disclosed in connection with a commercial transaction where we or any one of our businesses are seeking financing, investment, support, or funding. In such transactions, Personal Information will be subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy in effect when the information was obtained.
