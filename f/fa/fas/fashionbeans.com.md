##### Cookies

A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer or mobile phone (referred to here as a “device”) browser from a website’s computer and is stored on your device’s hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other websites. Many websites do this whenever a user visits their website in order to track online traffic flows. You can find out more about the way cookies work on <http://www.aboutcookies.org/>.

FashionBeans.com uses cookies for a number of purposes, for instance to enable us to simplify the logging on process for registered users, to help ensure the security and authenticity of registered users, to track affiliate sales, to serve the correct advertising to visitors and to monitor traffic.

Cookies also help us to improve our website and to deliver a better and more personalised service. They enable us:

  * To estimate our audience size and usage pattern.
  * To store information about your preferences, and so allow us to customise our website according to your individual interests.
  * To speed up your searches.
  * To recognise you when you return to our website.



To read more about how FashionBeans.com utilises cookies on its website, please read our official cookies policy, which can be found here: <http://www.fashionbeans.com/cookies/>

Most browsers allow you to turn off the cookie function. If you want to know how to do this please look at the help menu on your browser. This will impact on the functionality of the FashionBeans website, and the FashionBeans.com services you can use however.

We will use your information to provide and personalise our service. We will also use your contact details to communicate our bi-weekly newsletter with you **only if you have opted in**. We may use your information to send you offers and news about BeansPublishing.com products and services. _We will never sell your information to third parties (WE HATE SPAM)_. We may contact you by email for these purposes stated above.

If you have subscribed to FashionBeans.com newsletter (or any Beanspublishing Limited website), you will be provided with an unsubscribe link in every mail we send you; which can be used if the mailing does not suit your personal taste or requirements.

We like to hear your views to help us improve our service. From time to time, we may contact you by email. Again, if you do not want to be contacted for this purpose, you can unsubscribe at any time.

Please note that there may be instances where it may be necessary for us to communicate with you, in any event, for administrative or operational reasons relating to our service.

We may disclose your personal information to any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 736 of the UK Companies Act 1985. We will never pass your personal data to anyone else.

In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets. Likewise, if FashionBeans.com or all of its assets are acquired by a third party, personal data held about its customers will be one of the transferred assets.

We will keep your information confidential except where disclosure is required or permitted by law (for example to government bodies and law enforcement agencies) or as described in the ‘Offensive Or Inappropriate Content: Disclosure Of Information’ section below. Generally, we will only use your information within the BeansPublishing Limited websites.

###### Offensive Or Inappropriate Content: Disclosure Of Information

If you post or send offensive, inappropriate or objectionable content anywhere on or to the BeansPublishing Limited websites or engage in any disruptive behaviour on any BeansPublishing Limited service, we may use your personal information to stop such behaviour.

Where we reasonably believe that you are or may be in breach of any of the laws of England and Wales (or the law of Scotland if you live there), the BBC may use your personal information to inform relevant third parties such as your employer, school email/internet provider or law enforcement agencies about the content and your behaviour.

##### Where We Store Your Personal Data

All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. You should not write down or share this password with anyone.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our website; any transmission is at your own risk.

Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

###### How Long Will You Hold My Information?

We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as is necessary for the relevant activity. If you cancel your registration as a FashionBeans.com website user and your account is deleted, it will be removed immediately and automatically by the system.

Where you contribute material to FashionBeans.com, we will generally only keep your content for as long as is reasonably required for the purpose(s) for which it was submitted.

##### Your Rights

You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data. You can also exercise the right at any time by [contacting us](https://web.archive.org/contact-us/).

Any access request will be subject to a fee of £10 to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you, and we will require you to prove your identity with 2 pieces of approved identification.
