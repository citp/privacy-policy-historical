  <p>This policy (“Privacy Policy”) informs you of the policies of Wired Mediaand its subsidiary entities (collectively,   “Wired”) concerning the collection, use and disclosure of personal   information from this and other Wired-related websites (the   “Website(s)”).  Because we may gather certain types of information about   our users and understand your privacy is important to you, we want to   help you understand the terms and conditions surrounding the collection   and use of that information.  Even though we may need to collect   information about you to provide some of the products and services we   offer, you may not want us to disclose that information to others.    Accordingly, what follows is a description of how we gather and use   information about you (collectively “Your Information”).  Please read   this Privacy Policy carefully so that you understand what information we   collect through our Websites, what we do with that information, and how   to safeguard personal information you provide to us.</p>
  <p>Please note that by visiting this Website you consent to the   collection of Your Information by Wired as set forth in this Privacy   Policy.</p>
  <p>1.<strong> Disclosure of Personal Information to Outside Parties:</strong></p>
  <p>Except as set forth in this policy, Wired does not sell, trade, or   rent your personal information to others.  However, Wired may provide   aggregate statistics about our customers, traffic patterns, and related   Website information to third-party vendors. Generally, these statistics   will include no personally identifying information.  Wired may also   release Your Information when we believe, in good faith, that such   release is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with the law, (ii) enforce   or apply the terms of our Terms of Use applicable to this Website,   (iii) enforce contest, sweepstakes, promotions, and/or game rules, or   (iv) protect the rights, property or safety of Wired, our users, or   others.  Also, we may give some or all of Your Information to   third-party vendors who assist us in fulfilling some of the functions of   this Website.  Finally, we may provide Your Information to third   parties if you authorize us to do so.</p>
  <p>2.<strong> Information We Collect and How We Use It:</strong></p>
  <p>a) <strong><em>Voluntary Information You Provide Us</em></strong><strong>.</strong> If you contact us by email, complete our registration forms, surveys,   or entry forms, subscribe to our services or newsletters or participate   in any of our contests or sweepstakes, we will ask you for Your   Information.  The information we ask for in this context may include   contact information (such as your name and email address) and/or   demographic information (such as your zip code or age).  Below you will   find descriptions of how Wired may use these types of information.</p>
  <p>b) <strong><em>Registration Data</em></strong><strong>. </strong>Registration   data is voluntary personal information provided directly by you in   order to receive optional access to certain services or Website areas   and which may include information such as your name, age, email address,   zip code or telephone number.  In addition, registration data may   include preference information such as usernames, passwords, desired   newsletters, etc.  Here are some of the ways we might use Your   Information in this context:</p>
  <ul>
		<li>To deliver services such as newsletters, offers, message boards, forums and other items;</li>
  	<li>To help us create and deliver the content that is most relevant to you;</li>
  	<li>To alert you to news, events, contests, and other items if you so request;</li>
  	<li>To allow you entrance into restricted areas of the Website, as appropriate;</li>
  	<li>To send you information about Wired and our Websites;</li>
  	<li>To compile statistics and conduct basic research; and</li>
  	<li>To give to third parties, who may send you promotional material.</li>
  	</ul>
  <p>c) <strong><em>Surveys</em></strong><strong>.</strong> Sometimes Wired posts optional surveys in which we ask for Your   Information.  The choice is yours – you don’t have to answer surveys,   but if you do, please understand that Wired may use Your Information and   that we may share Your Information with third parties.  If we’re asking   for optional information, we may mark it as such so that you can skip   that portion if you would like.  Here are some ways we might use Your   Information in this context:</p>
  <ul>
		<li>To deliver services such as newsletters, offers, message boards, forums and other items;</li>
  	<li>To send you information about Wired and our Websites;</li>
  	<li>To help us create and deliver the content that is most relevant to you;</li>
  	<li>To give to our content partners, who may send you promotional material;</li>
  	<li>To give to our advertisers, who may send you information about their products and services;</li>
  	<li>To share in aggregate form with our partners and advertisers;</li>
  	<li>To compile statistics and conduct basic research; and</li>
  	<li>To give to third parties, who may send you promotional material.</li>
  	</ul>
  <p>d) <strong><em>Contests, Sweepstakes and Promotions</em></strong>.    From time to time Wired runs contests and sweepstakes in which we ask   for Your Information, which may include but is not limited to your name,   age, email address, and telephone number, so we can determine if you’re   eligible for the contest and to notify you know if you win.  Sometimes   we request additional information such as your gender, marital status   and income level.  Here are some of the ways we might use Your   Information in this context:</p>
  <ul>
		<li>To determine if you’re eligible for the contest;</li>
  	<li>To notify you if you’re a winner;</li>
  	<li>To give to content partners, who may send you promotional email;</li>
  	<li>To help us create and deliver the content that is most relevant to you;</li>
  	<li>To give to advertisers, who may send you email about their products and services;</li>
  	<li>To share in aggregate form with our partners and advertisers; and</li>
  	<li>To compile statistics and conduct basic research.</li>
  	</ul>
  <p><strong>e) </strong><strong><em>Special Offers<strong>. </strong></em></strong>From   time to time, Wired and its affiliated entities are able to provide to   you special offers of products and services. When providing these   offers, we need to gather Your Information, which may include but is not   limited to your name, age, email address and telephone number. Your   acceptance of these offers is completely voluntary, but if you do not   correctly provide Your Information as required, you may not receive the   product or service offered.  Here is how we may use Your Information in   this context:</p>
  <ul>
		<li>To deliver services that you request or purchase such as newsletters, offers, message boards, forums and other items;</li>
  	<li>To ensure proper delivery of the product or service;</li>
  	<li>To view statistics and conduct basic research;</li>
  	<li>To give to select parties on our Website, who may send you promotional material;</li>
  	<li>To give to select radio stations, who may send you promotional material;</li>
  	<li>To give to third parties, who may send you information about their products and services; and</li>
  	<li>To compile statistics and conduct basic research.</li>
  	</ul>
  <p>f) <strong><em>Online Commerce Services.</em></strong> This   Website may offer shopping and other online commerce services, which may   be offered by Wired or by a firm that operates a store under contract   with us. If our Website offers such services, you will use a customer   order form to request information, products, and services. The order   form will ask you to give us contact information (e.g., name or email   address), financial information (e.g., account or credit card numbers),   and demographic information (e.g., zip code or age).  We will use the   financial information that you provide to bill you for products and   services.  By giving our Website your credit card and related personal   information, you are authorizing our store to give that information to   the merchant and credit card company in order to confirm and fulfill   your order.  We will use contact information from the order form to   fulfill your orders.  We may also use contact data to get in touch with   you when necessary.  We will not otherwise use or distribute your   financial information without your prior approval.</p>
  <p>g) <strong><em>Information We Obtain From Other Sources</em></strong>.    Where permitted by applicable law, we may collect information about   you from other sources, including through interactive applications   (e.g., mobile devices, third-party services and embedded video players),   from co-branded partners and websites (e.g., on our Facebook pages) and   from commercially available sources (e.g., data on aggregators and   public databases).  The following are examples of Your Information that   we may collect from other sources:</p>
  <ul>
		<li>Name, address and telephone number;</li>
  	<li>Demographic data, such as age, gender and income level;</li>
  	<li>Your interests and purchase behavior;</li>
  	<li>Publicly-observed data, such as activities on blogs, videos and other online postings; and</li>
  	<li>Other navigation data, such as websites visited and advertisements viewed or clicked on.</li>
  	</ul>
  <p>h) <strong><em>Combining Information.</em></strong> Please note   that all of the information we collect about you may be combined,   including to help us tailor our communications to you and to develop   rich online content and services across the Wired Websites.</p>
  <p>i) <strong><em>Public Forums.</em></strong> This Website   makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available   to its users.  Any information you disclose in these areas becomes   public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to   disclose your personal information.  We cannot safeguard the privacy of   any such information you choose to disclose online in this manner and   you must do so carefully and at your own risk.</p>
  <p>j) <strong><em>User-Generated Content.</em></strong> Some   Wired Websites enable users to submit their own content for contests,   blogs, videos, message boards and other functions.  Publication of user   generated content on the Wired Websites is subject to the terms and   rules contained in our Terms of Use for our Websites.  Please remember   that any information you disclose becomes public information and   exercise caution when deciding to disclose your contact, financial and   other information in a submission.  We cannot prevent such information   from being used in a manner that may violate this Privacy Policy, the   law, or your personal privacy and safety.</p>
  <p>k) <strong><em>Banner Advertising.</em></strong> We license   ad-server software from another company to place banner advertising on   our Websites.  All of the data provided and generated by such software   will remain in our possession and no data will be transferred to the   licensor of the software.  This feature of our Websites may, on   occasion, set “cookies” on your computer.  Any information collected or   stored by the ad-service or the cookies is treated in the same manner as   other information as described in this statement.</p>
  <p>Third-party companies serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous   information through Audience Management tags when you visit our   Websites. These companies may use non-personally identifiable   information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and   date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your   visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements   about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These   companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect   this information. To learn more about this behavioral advertising   practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices</a>. “24/7 Real Media” and “Google, Inc.” are our ad serving providers. Select the company checkbox to opt-out.</p>
  <p>l) <strong><em>Confirmed Opt-In.</em></strong> Wired acquires   no personal or registration data about our users except what you   explicitly and voluntarily provide (i.e., via opt-in).  We reserve the   right to use this information specifically for the purposes related to   your registration in addition to any other purpose set forth in this   Privacy Policy.</p>
  <p>m) <strong><em>Feedback Data.</em></strong> Feedback data is   voluntary information (e.g., success stories) provided directly by you   for the purposes of assessing the products or services provided through   Wired Websites. There are areas on Wired-owned Websites which allow you   to submit feedback.  Any feedback you submit in these areas becomes the   property of Wired, and we reserve the right to use this information for   the purposes of marketing, quality control, or to contact you for   further information.</p>
  <p>n) <strong><em>Usage (Log) Data. </em></strong>Wired also   gathers and analyzes usage or log data including your IP (internet   protocol) address assigned by your ISP (internet service provider), the   type of operating system you are using on your computer, and the type of   web browser you are using to view our Website. Wired management uses   usage or log data to help diagnose problems with and optimize   performance of the server.  This information also allows us to evaluate   user traffic patterns into, out from, and within our Website. These   uses, however, do not allow us to connect your IP address with your   personal identity.</p>
  <p>o) <strong><em>What About “Cookies”?</em></strong> “Cookies”   are small pieces of information that your web browser stores on your   computer’s hard drive which may contain personally identifying   information.  From time to time our Website may place cookies on your   computer’s hard drive that enable our systems to recognize your browser   and to provide you with certain features. Use of cookies also provides   information about your web usage, which helps us compile demographic and   statistical information about visitors who are utilizing our Website.    Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually   change your browser to prevent that.</p>
  <p>3.<strong> Updating and Deleting Personal Data:</strong></p>
  <p>a) <strong><em>Correcting and Updating. </em></strong>You may   correct or update your registration data by either signing into your   online account or by contacting us by clicking the “<a title="Contact Us" href="http://faithvid.com/contact">Contact Us</a>” link on our Website.</p>
  <p>b) <strong><em>Delete/Deactivate/Opt-Out of Email Subscriptions.</em></strong> You may delete or deactivate your account by either signing into your online account or by contacting us by clicking the “<a title="Contact Us" href="http://faithvid.com/contact">Contact Us</a>”   link on our Website and submitting a request to be removed from our   database.  Wired will comply with all such requests within a reasonable   period of time.  Please note that we may need to retain some information   about you in order to satisfy our legal and security obligations; for   example, some of your information may remain in backup storage even if   you ask us to delete it.  In some cases, you may be entitled under local   laws to access or object to the possession of information that we hold   relating to you.</p>
  <p>4. <strong>Information Shared With Third Parties:</strong></p>
  <p>a) <strong><em>Information Sharing With Third Parties.</em></strong> From time to time we may enter into a special relationship with   another company that is not owned by Wired to provide additional   features on our Websites.  These special relationships may include   “powered by” partners, business partners, sponsors, and co-branded sites   (referred to here as “co-branded pages”). You should look for a   specific privacy statement on any such co-branded page. Any personal   information that you provide when signing up at one of those co-branded   pages may be shared with our third party partner.  You should also check   our partner’s website for information regarding its privacy policies.    Additionally, the nature of some features of our Website may require   that we share personal information about you with persons or companies   outside of the Wired corporate enterprise.  For example, this may occur   with a feature that enables you, via our Website, to ask questions of   persons or entities that are not part of the Wired enterprise.  By   responding to those features of the Website, whether by email or direct   entry of information on our Website, you are consenting to our   transferring of that information to such persons or entities.</p>
  <p>b) <strong><em>Links to Other Sites.</em></strong> When you   visit Wired Websites, you may be linked to other outside sites. This   includes links to sites operated by advertisers, sponsors, and partners   that may use Wired’s logo as part of an agreement with Wired. These   other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or   solicit Your Information. These other sites may be developed by people   over whom Wired exercises no control and, as such, are not subject to   the Wired Privacy Policy. Wired is not responsible for the privacy   policies of these other sites, nor for the use of any of Your   Information that these sites may collect.</p>
  <p>c) <strong><em>Sale of Our Company.</em></strong> Wired may   include any information we collect through this Website in our customer   information database. This database is considered an asset owned by   Wired. As in any business venture, the sale of Wired is always a   possibility, either as an entire corporate entity or through an asset   sale that may include our customer information database.  Should another   entity ever purchase or acquire Wired or its assets, all information   contained in our customer information database will be considered a   transferred asset and become the property of the purchasing or acquiring   entity.</p>
  <p>5. <strong>Specific Privacy Rights:</strong></p>
  <p>a) <strong><em>Children’s Privacy</em></strong><strong><em>.</em></strong> Consistent with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, this   Website does not collect, use or disclose personal information   (including online contact information) of children under the age of   thirteen (13).  In the event that a child under the age of 13 attempts   to register on our Website(s), we will not knowingly accept that   registration and will delete information received from the child.  In   the event that a child posts personal information in a public forum such   as a chat room, we will attempt to delete that information once we   become aware of it.</p>
  <p>Parents can give written parental consent for their child to use   Wired Websites, however, by completing the Wired Parental Consent Form.    To request this form, or if you have any questions or comments   regarding children’s privacy at Wired, please contact us by clicking the   “<a title="Contact Us" href="http://faithvid.com/contact">Contact Us</a>” link on our Website.</p>
  <p>b) <strong><em>Your California Privacy Rights</em></strong>.    Beginning on January 1, 2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83   permits customers of Wired who are California residents to request   certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to   third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a   request, please contact us by clicking the “<a title="Contact Us" href="http://faithvid.com/contact">Contact Us</a>” link on our Website.</p>
  <p>6. <strong>Security and Enforcement:</strong></p>
  <p>a)<strong><em> Information Security.</em></strong> The security   and confidentiality of Your Information is extremely important to us.    Accordingly, we believe we have appropriate security measures in place,   consistent with standard industry practice, to protect against the   unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, misuse or destruction of   data.  Please be aware, however, that despite our best efforts, no   security measures are perfect or impenetrable.  As such, while we want   you to feel confident using the Wired Websites, we cannot ensure or   warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.</p>
  <p>b)<strong><em> Enforcement.</em></strong> We regularly review our   compliance with our Privacy Policy and will respond accordingly to any   formal written complaints, including, if necessary, working with the   appropriate regulatory authority to resolve any complaints regarding the   transfer of personal data that we cannot resolve with our users   directly.</p>
  <p>7. <strong>Miscellaneous:</strong></p>
  <p>a) <strong><em>Leased Content.</em></strong> No third-party   licensor shall have any liability for the accuracy or completeness of   information or services provided thereby via this Website or any   component thereof or for delays, inaccuracies, omissions, or other   defects therein, nor for any claims or losses arising therefrom or   occasioned thereby, including, without limitation, any lost profits,   indirect, special, or consequential damages.  Any such third party   licensors have exclusive proprietary rights from the information   received via the service.  Customer, end-user, or visitor, as   applicable, shall not use or permit anyone to use the information   provided through the service for any unlawful or unauthorized purpose.    Customer, end-user, or visitor, as applicable, is not authorized or   permitted to furnish such information to any person or firm for reuse or   retransmission without prior written approval of the source of such   information.  Provision of the information on the service is subject to   termination in the event that any agreement between a third party   licensor and a provider of information distributed through the service   is terminated in accordance with its terms.  Third party licensor and   its subsidiaries, affiliates, information providers and content partners   shall have no liability for investment decisions based on the   information provided hereby.</p>
  <p>b) <strong><em>General Information.</em></strong> This Privacy   Policy and the Terms of Use for this Website shall be governed by,   construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of   Virginia, as it is applied to agreements entered into and to be   performed entirely within such state, without regard to conflict of law   principles. You agree that any cause of action you or Wired brings to   enforce this Policy and/or the Terms of Use, or in connection with any   matters related to this Wired Website and/or the Privacy Policy, shall   be brought only in either the state or Federal courts located in   Richmond, Virginia. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of   the courts of the State of Virginia for any cause of action arising out   of this Policy.  If any provision of this Privacy Policy, or the   application thereof to any person or circumstances, is held invalid or   for any reason unenforceable including, but not limited to, the warranty   disclaimers and liability limitations, then such provision shall be   deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that matches, as   closely as possible, the original provision, and the other provisions of   this Policy shall remain in full force and effect.  The failure of   either party to insist upon strict performance of any provision of this   Privacy Policy shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or   right. Unless expressly provided otherwise, this Privacy Policy and the   Terms of Use for this Website are the entire agreement between you and   Wired with respect to the use of this Wired Website and shall not be   modified except in writing, signed by an authorized representative of   Wired.
