# Fairview Health Services Privacy Statement - Privacy - Fairview Health Services

Fairview is concerned about the privacy interests of consumers and is committed to respecting your privacy by using any personal information gathered in only the most responsible way possible. Fairview does not acquire any more information about customers than is necessary to provide efficient and secure service. When we collect personal data, we will endeavor to disclose to you how we will use this information. Fairview will also seek to take all appropriate steps to ensure that any personal information given is protected by secure technology, including using digital signatures and other credit card data protection technology. When Fairview collects your personal data, we may use it for research or to improve our service or web site. We will ask if you want us or any of our business partners to use that information to contact you in the future about new products or services that might interest you. If you do not wish to be contacted by Fairview or any of our business partners, you can choose to have your information kept out. Fairview gives access to personal information about consumers only to employees who require it to perform their jobs. We will take every appropriate step to keep your information secure from other employees.
