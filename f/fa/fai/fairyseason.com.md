We want you to have an enjoyable shopping experience and while it is necessary for us to collect certain personal information, we respect and protect your right to privacy as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

You don’t have to give us any of this personal information but if you don’t, you may not be able to buy from the site, and you are unlikely to receive our optimal overall customer experience. But that is your choice – and we respect that.

3.  **About marketing message:**

If you have said we can, we’ll send you marketing messages by email, text, to keep you aware of what we’re up to and to help you see and find our products. You can stop receiving marketing messages from us at any time.

You can do this:

1)Through your account settings

2)By clicking on the ‘unsubscribe’ link in any email

Once you do this, we will update your profile to ensure that you don’t receive further marketing messages. Please note that, as FAIRYSEASON comprises a complex web of many inter-connecting services, it might take a few days for all our systems to be updated, so you might get messages from us while we process your request.

Stopping marketing messages will not stop service communications (such as order updates or where you have expressed an interest in an activity at FAIRYSEASON).

4.  **About keeping your information:**

We’ll hold on to your information for as long as you have your account, or as long as is needed to be able to provide the services to you, or (in the case of any contact you may have with our Customer Care team) for as long as is necessary to provide support-related reporting and trend analysis only.

If reasonably necessary or required to meet legal or regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, prevent fraud and abuse, or enforce our terms and conditions, we may also keep hold of some of your information as required, even after you have closed your account or it is no longer needed to provide the services to you.

5.  **About your rights:**

You have a lot of rights relating to your personal information:

1)The right to be informed about how your personal information is being used

2)The right to access the personal information we hold about you

3)The right to request the correction of inaccurate personal information we hold about you (although you can probably do most of this through My Account)

4)The right to request that we delete your data, or stop processing it or collecting it, in some circumstances

5)The right to stop direct marketing messages, which you can do through My Account and to withdraw consent for other consent-based processing at any time

6)The right to request that we transfer or port elements of your data either to you or another service provider

7)The right to complain to your data protection regulator — in the UK, the Information Commissioner’s Office
