We also apply the principles of the U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor framework:

(a.a.i) Notice (we tell you what we are collecting and when we are collecting it, and the purposes for which the information will be collected and used).

(a.a.ii) Choice (we give you the choice, where possible and appropriate, not to have your data collected or used in ways you do not wish it to be used).

**2\. Sites Covered**

This Privacy Policy applies to all websites and blogs directly owned by Factory Direct Craft ("our websites"). This Privacy Policy does not apply to websites, stores, or other domains that are maintained or operated by third-party or our affiliates.

**3\. Links to External Websites and Services**

Our websites may link to third-party websites and services. These links are not endorsements of these sites and this policy does not extend to them. Because this Privacy Policy is not enforced on these third-party websites, we would encourage you to read the Privacy Policy of the website before using the service or site and providing any personal data.

**4\. Online Shopping Facilities**

In some cases, we will partner with a third-party service provider to facilitate our online shopping services. Information collected during your shopping experience is in some cases maintained and processed by the third-party operating the online shopping facility. In these cases, their privacy policy will apply and we encourage you to make yourself aware of it in advance of placing an order. These third parties will usually share information with us about your transaction and we will store this information if they do so.

In order to most efficiently serve you, credit card transactions and order fulfillment are handled by established third-party banking, process agents and distribution institutions. They receive the information they need to verify and authorize your credit card transactions and to ship your order. When we collect credit card information for online purchases, we offer secured-server transactions that encrypt your information in transit.

**5\. Collection of Data and Personal Information**

To ensure that we provide you with the best possible experience, we will store, use and share data about you in accordance with this policy and the relevant registrations with data protection authorities.

For example, when you request information, subscribe to our emails or ask for support materials, register yourself or your Factory Direct Craft products, enter competitions or participate in surveys, or apply for a job at Factory Direct Craft, we will ask you to provide personal information to complete these transactions.

The sort of information that you provide in each case will vary and could include personal details such as your name, age and address. In some cases you will also provide additional information such as your preferences or product choices. In some cases we may ask you for a username and password that should only be known to you.

In addition to the information that you provide to us, we may also collect data about you during your visit to our website or while you engage with one of our marketing campaigns. We collect this data using automated tools that are detailed below. These tools collect data about your behavior and your computer system. Information like your Internet address (IP Address), the pages you have looked at and the things you have done while on our websites.

We also may use these tools in connection with our email marketing campaigns to allow us to understand what links you click on and what content is of interest to you. Factory Direct Craft also may collect data from commercial sources to enrich and verify the data that you have provided or that we have collected about you. This data will help us to ensure that we have accurate records, and will provide us with the ability to keep your information up to date. In some cases we may use this commercial data to work out something about you. For example, we may use your IP address to calculate your approximate geographic location.

 **(a) Cookies** 


A "cookie" is a small data file transmitted from a website to your computer's hard drive. Factory Direct Craft may use cookies on our websites to provide you with services and features. For example, we will use cookies to help you login to your account and provide a personalized experience. We may also use cookies to connect your activity together across multiple visits. In some cases we may also use cookies to monitor your interaction with our advertising campaigns; these cookies will be delivered by a third-party website but will provide us with information when you visit our website.

Cookies are usually defined in one of two ways and Factory Direct Craft sites may use both of them:

(a.a.i) Session cookies do not stay on your computer after you close your browser. (a.a.ii) Persistent cookies remain on your computer until you delete them or they expire.


Most browsers automatically accept cookies by default, but you can usually refuse cookies or selectively accept cookies by adjusting the preferences in your browser. The following browsers have online guides to cookies at the following links:

Microsoft Internet Explorer: http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.htm 

Mozilla Firefox: http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/psm/help_21/using_priv_help.html

Please be aware that a number of features on our websites may require cookies to operate correctly, turning off cookies may affect your experience on our website.

 **(b) Web Beacons** A Web beacon is an electronic image. Web beacons can track certain things form your computer and can report activity back to a web server allowing us to understand some of your behavior. If you choose to receive emails from Factory Direct Craft, we may use web beacons to track your reaction to our emails. We may also use them to track if you click on the links and at what time and date you do so. Some of our marketing partners may use web beacons to track your interaction with online advertising banners.

**(c) Embedded Web Links** Links provided in our emails and in some cases on third-party websites may include tracking embedded in the link. The tracking is accomplished through a redirection system. The redirection system allows Factory Direct Craft to understand how the link is being used.

Some of these links will enable Factory Direct Craft to identify that you have personally clicked on the link and this may be attached to the personal data that we hold about you. This data is used to improve our service to you and to help us understand the performance of our marketing campaigns.

**(d) Third-Party Websites and Services** Factory Direct Craft works with a number of service providers of marketing communications technology. These service providers may use various data collection methods to improve the performance of the marketing campaigns we are contracting them to provide. The Data collected can be gathered on our websites and also on the websites where our marketing communications are appearing. For example, we may collect data where our banner advertisements are displayed on third-party websites. 




**6\. Social Media**

We may provide features on our websites that allow you to share and connect through social networks. These features connect with the services provided by the social networks and therefore the privacy controls in place are those of the social networks. We encourage that you, before engaging with any of these tools, review the privacy settings of your social profiles and also to read the privacy policies of the networks in question. These social features often store information about you and the things that you share or comment upon.

If you share any of your personal information through a public forum or social network enabled feature on our websites this information could be read by anyone. Factory Direct Craft therefore is not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these forums and any access to or use of that information.
