Factual values the privacy of the users, subscribers, publishers, members, and others who visit the Site or Services (collectively or individually, "users"). By using the Site or Services, you expressly consent to the information handling practices described in this notice. Your use of the Site and Services and any personal information you provide through the Site and Services are subject at all time to this Privacy Notice and the [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/tos).

* ## The Information Factual Collects

In order to use some elements of the Site or Services, users must register with the site and in the process we may collect certain user-provided, personally identifiable information including name and email address. In addition, we may conduct surveys, offer sweepstakes and make other opportunities available that require you to provide personal information such as your name and email address. 

Our server logs also automatically collect information such as your IP address, pages you access, your browser type and language, and the date and time of your visit, which helps us track users’ movements around our site and understand trends. 

We may assign your computer one or more cookies which may collect information to facilitate access to our website and to personalize your online experience. We, and third-party service providers with whom we partner, may use standard Internet tools such as cookies and web beacons, which collect information that tracks your use of our website and enables us to customize our services. These cookies and web beacons may be set by our third-party partners and service providers to assist us in managing the content on our Site and in understanding how users interact with our Site. These technologies collect non-personal information about your visit to our Site. Factual does not control the third party technologies employed on its Site for this purpose. 

* ## The User Information Factual Receives In Order To Provide the Services

We receive information from our supply/publisher and demand/advertiser partners about their users, such as the geolocation data of a user’s mobile device and an identifier. The identifier may be a device ID from the user’s mobile device, such as the IDFA for iOS devices or Android ID for Android devices. We may also receive a user’s age, gender, date of birth and other information, if the user provided it to that partner. 

The information that we receive from such partners is combined with additional information we collect from 3rd party sources. This supplemental data is associated with geographic locations, such as demographic and business information. 

* ## The Way Factual Uses Information

Factual uses the information that you provide or that we collect and receive to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide the features and services found on the Site and in our other Services as well as to track user-generated content and Users to the extent necessary to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. 

If you have provided us with your email address, we will use your email address, without further consent, for administrative communications such as notifying you of major Site and Services updates, for customer service purposes, to address copyright infringement or defamation issues, to contact you regarding any content that you have posted to or downloaded from the Site or Services, and/or to provide you with additional information and service offers (e.g., our newsletter). If you do not want to receive promotional emails, please [notify us](https://web.archive.org/contact#other), or follow the unsubscribe instructions within the email. 

Factual uses all of the information that we collect to understand the usage trends and preferences of our Users, to improve the way the Site or Services works and looks, and to create new features and functionality. 

Factual may use “Automatically Collected” information and “Cookies” information to: (a) automatically update the Factual application on your system; (b) remember your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you access the Factual Platform; (c) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages accessed; (d) provide such metrics to Users as they pertain to such User’s uploaded content; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities. 

We use the information we receive from our partners in conjunction with the data from other 3rd party sources to help determine demographic and interest attributes about users. For example, we may assign demographic or interest segments to a user based on their location(s) and provide this information to our partners to enable them to provide more relevant advertising. 

* ## When Factual Discloses Information

Factual shares the information we receive only as described in this privacy policy and does not share the personal information you provide to us with other organizations for their marketing or promotional uses without your prior express consent. Please be aware, however, that any information that you voluntarily choose to display on the Site or Services becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by others without restriction. 

As part of our Services, we provide the demographic and interest segments of users to certain of our partners. Their use of this information is not covered by this privacy policy. 

We may disclose user information to affiliated companies or other businesses or persons to: provide web site hosting, maintenance, and security services; fulfill orders; conduct data analysis and create reports; offer certain functionality; and assist Factual in improving the Site or Services and creating new services features.

Factual may disclose user information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with applicable laws (such as U.S. Copyright law) or respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant in the manner required by the requesting entity. 

In the event that Factual is acquired by or merged with a third-party entity or is potentially going to be acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from users as part of that actual or potential merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. 

Factual also reserves the right to disclose user information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary: to take precautions against liability; to protect Factual from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful activities; to investigate and defend ourselves against third-party claims or allegations; to assist government enforcement agencies; to protect the security or integrity of the Site and Services; or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Factual, our users, or others.
