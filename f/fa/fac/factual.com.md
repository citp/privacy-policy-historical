## **1\. Introduction. ******

At Factual, we value your privacy. Please read this privacy policy (“ **Privacy Policy** ”) carefully so you can make informed decisions about your relationship with us. This Privacy Policy may be revised periodically; please revisit this page regularly to remain up to date on any changes. Material changes, if any, will be summarized at the top. 

If you reside outside of the U.S., please note the section on International Visitors.

## **2\. Who are we?**

Factual is a location data services company powering innovation in product development, mobile marketing, and real-world analytics. We help our Customers in many ways, from driving greater personalization and enhanced features within digital consumer products and mobile apps to providing retail analytics and other insights, to name a few. 

Our business is based on providing services to our Customers related to two major categories of data: (a) points of interest data; and, (b) device data. Point-of-interest data means detailed data related to businesses and other points of interest: e.g., restaurants, stores, hotels, doctors’ offices, airports, monuments, and includes information such as location coordinates (such as showing the location coordinates of a local grocery store). Device data, which is further described below, provides observations received from or associated with specific Consumer or User devices and their precise location coordinates over time from which Factual derives inferences (“ **Device Data** ”).

## **3\. Who are you?**

If you’re reading this Privacy Policy, you probably fall into one of the following categories of people:

  * “ **Consumers** ” are individuals who use apps from which Factual receives or collects data to power its Services (such as apps that are owned or operated by Factual’s Partners, or the Partner’s partners). Please note that Factual has elected to pause its Audience business in EU until further notice; therefore, Factual will not knowingly receive or collect personal data of Consumers who are residents of the EEA and Switzerland.
  * “ **Customers** ” means anyone who uses Factual’s Services and includes brands, advertising agencies, media and technology platforms;
  * “ **Partners** ” are third-parties (e.g., publishers, third-party app developers) who provide data to Factual to power the Services used by Factual’s Customers, and includes parties that use Factual’s software development kit (SDK) to collect information; some of our Partners are also Customers of Factual;
  * “ **Users** ” are users who visit Factual’s website or any website that links to this policy (“ **Site** ”) or use Factual’s apps, including you if you’re reading this Privacy Policy on our Site; some of our Users are also Customers of Factual.



Depending on your relationship with Factual, you may fall into more than one of the above categories.

## **4\. What does this Privacy Policy cover**

This Privacy Policy relates to: (a) Factual’s services that involve the use of Device Data and Derived Data (“ **Services** ”); and, (b) Factual’s collection and use of information obtained through our Site(s) (including Factual User Accounts) and Factual’s apps (“ **User Information** ”). Device Data is described in the section What Consumer information does Factual receive? below. 

This Privacy Policy does not apply to companies that Factual does not own or control, including Factual’s Customers. For example, as part of our Services, Factual may provide Device Data and information derived from Device Data (“ **Derived Data** ”) to Customers (or other third parties at the direction of a Customer). Factual may also provide the Device Data to third-party platforms for resale. Device Data and Derived Data are, collectively, “ **Observation Data** ”. 

The use of Device Data by Factual’s Customers and other third parties is not covered by this Privacy Policy. Some of these Customers and other third parties may use cookies or similar technologies such as web beacons (collectively, “ **Cookies** ”) in order to send targeted ads to Consumers, engage with Consumers, or otherwise locate Consumers. Customers may associate the Device Data with additional information they have from other sources. To learn more about how Factual’s Customers collect, use, and disclose information about Consumers, please review the relevant Customer’s privacy policy; a Customer’s data handling practices are governed by its own privacy policy, not Factual’s Privacy Policy.

## **5\. What Consumer information does Factual receive?**

Factual works closely with Partners who provide data to power our Services. Factual’s Partners may publish (or provide services to app developers who publish) apps for use by Consumers. Some of those Partners use Factual’s SDK within apps to collect that data for sharing with Factual. Partners may also display ads for viewing by Consumers and record whether or not the ad was displayed for an individual Consumer. 

Factual may receive Device Data that varies depending on the information and consent(s) provided by a Consumer to a Partner. Additionally, some Customers may provide Factual with other information (such as street addresses and related personal information) for use in the curation of Device Data. That Device Data in combination with Derived Data make up the Observation Data that powers Factual’s Services. 

Factual requires its Partners to provide transparent disclosures and collect consent from the Consumer as necessary to enable the uses described in the section How does Factual use Device Data for its Services? below.

## **6\. How does Factual use Device Data for its Services?**

Factual uses various categories of Device Data as described below to power our Services:

**Categories of Device Data.** | **How Device Data is used.**  
---|---  
Demographic and Interest-based Information. | This data is used to power our Services, in particular, to help our Customers target advertising based on traits such as ‘female’ or ‘coffee drinker’.  
Device Information. | This data is used to power our Services, in particular, to help our Customers personalize services, target advertising, or measure the effectiveness of various advertising campaigns. It also helps both Factual and our Customers understand more about which devices Consumers have and how they use them.  
Attribution Information. | This data helps our Customers measure the effectiveness of advertising and marketing campaigns.  
Other Information. | If Factual receives any data that it deems of low integrity or is not related to the disclosed purpose of processing, then Factual will filter out that data and delete it. We receive this data because we cannot validate the integrity of the data until we have received it.  
  
“ **Demographic and Interest-based Information** ” means information which may (but does not necessarily) include: imputed or actual data about a Consumer such as age, gender, or birth year; inferred or actual characteristics or interests such as ‘coffee drinker’ or ‘frequent shopper’ which can be based on a device’s location over time; and, any other information that the Consumer provides to the relevant Partner;

**“Device Information** ” means information about the device which may (but does not necessarily) include: Device Geolocation Data, mobile advertising identifier, device type (e.g., tablet, smartphone, television), operating system (e.g., iOS, Android), app name or identifier, IP address, network provider, mobile carrier, mobile browser type (e.g., Firefox, Chrome), timestamp, time zone, information about the speed, bearing, orientation, and altitude of a device, or other device-identifying information, including cross-device information. For more information on cross-device linking, please see What is interest-based advertising and cross-device linking?

“ **Device Geolocation Data** ” means precise geolocation data from or about a Consumer’s device, which may be expressed by latitude-longitude coordinates obtained through GPS tools, WiFi data, cell tower triangulation or other techniques, and linked to a mobile advertising ID. “

“ **Attribution Information** ” means information about Consumer activities that help Factual determine how a Consumer has responded to advertising or content, such as determining whether a Consumer who viewed a particular advertisement ultimately visited the advertiser’s retail store. 

The Device Data that Factual receives from its Partners may be combined with additional information Factual collects or receives from third-party sources. For example, Factual may have information about consumer products, events held at specific locations, street addresses, information about the possible relationships among different devices, and categories of geographic locations, or points of interest. When such information is associated with a specific device, we treat it as Device Data. 

Factual generally uses the Device Data it collects or receives for the following purposes: (a) to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide the Services described below; (b) to improve and market the Services; and, (c) to create new features and functionality. 

Factual’s Services help our Customers learn more about Consumers based on Device Data, including Device Geolocation Data. For example, the Services help our Customers: (v) provide more relevant content or advertising to Consumers over time and across multiple devices; (w) identify other Consumers that may be interested in their offerings; (x) measure the performance of Customers’ content, services, and advertising (for instance, what effect certain ads have in comparison to others), or trends and preferences among Consumers (for instance, what types of Consumers generally tend to shop at certain stores); (y) learn how Customers’ apps may perform better; or, (z) generally improve their services. 

Factual provides Customers with non-EU standard interest segments based on health- and wellness-related interests or information, to deliver interest-based advertisements and for other purposes; these segments are based on data that is not considered sensitive under the Network Advertising Initiative Code of Conduct. For a complete list of such non-sensitive health segments, please [click here](https://web.archive.org/privacy/health-segments/). From time to time, Factual may assist Customers in creating custom interest segments based on health- and wellness-related interests or information with a local focus, such as selecting specific chain stores or restricting to a particular city.

## **7\. How long does Factual retain Device Data**

Factual may retain the Device Data: (a) as needed for interest-based advertising, ad delivery, and reporting purposes for up to 24 months after Factual’s last observation of the mobile advertising identifier; and, (b) for other business purposes (including technical developments, legal, accounting, auditing, or bug-detection and prevention) for such period as Factual considers reasonably necessary. 

Factual may retain Device Data beyond these time periods if required by law.

## **8\. Does Factual share Consumer information?**

Factual may share or disclose Device Data in a limited number of circumstances as follows:

**Categories of recipients** | **Purpose of sharing**  
---|---  
Customers | Factual will disclose Device Data in order to provide its Services to Customers.  
Government, law enforcement, or regulatory body | Factual will disclose Device Data if it believes that such action is necessary to comply with applicable laws or regulatory investigations, or to respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, warrant, or law enforcement request.  
Factual’s service providers | Factual will share Device Data with service providers that help it operate the Services.  
Factual’s affiliates and joint venture partners | Factual will share Device Data with its affiliates and joint venture partners in order to operate or enhance Factual’s business.  
Acquiror or merger entity. | In the event that Factual is acquired by or merged with a third-party entity or is potentially going to be acquired by or merged with a third-party entity, in any partial or total sale of assets including in the event of bankruptcy, or in any other corporate change, Factual may transfer or assign the Device Data as part of that actual or potential merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control (or in connection with related due diligence).  
Other | Factual will disclose Device Data if it believes it will help to protect Factual, its Customers, or any other person or third party, or to enforce any legal rights.  
  
## **9\. How can Consumers opt out?**

#### **a. What are interest-based advertising and cross-device linking?**

Factual is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and adheres to the NAI Code of Conduct as described on the [NAI website](http://www.networkadvertising.org/). Factual also adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Self-Regulatory Principles. For a description of the DAA Program, please visit the [DAA website](http://www.aboutads.info/). Factual may use or transfer Device Data that it directly collects or that it receives from Factual’s Customers, who may use Cookies, to enable advertising that is tailored to Consumers’ inferred interests, preferences, and locations. This practice is known as interest-based advertising. 

To find out more about interest-based advertising in the web environment, and how to opt-out of information collection for this purpose by companies that participate in the Network Advertising Initiative or the Digital Advertising Alliance, visit [NAI’s opt-out page](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1) or [DAA’s Consumer Choice Page](http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2). EEA and Swiss residents, please refer to [www.youronlinechoices.com](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/). 

Factual may also receive, use, or transfer Device Data collected from one device on other devices that may be linked to or inferentially associated (e.g., through common IP-address) with the same user of the device where data was collected. This is known as cross-device linking.

#### **b. Opting out of interest-based advertising Services by Factual.**

Factual, and some of Factual’s Customers, provide the ability for Consumers to opt out of the collection and use of mobile app data (such as Device Data) across apps over time on a device for interest-based advertising purposes (including cross-device linking for such purposes), through the DAA’s AppChoices tool. 

To opt out of Factual’s collection, use, and transfer of Device Data for interest-based advertising purposes, Consumers can download the AppChoices app onto the relevant mobile device and exercise choice through the app. When such choice is exercised on a device, Factual will also stop using and transferring Device Data from that device for interest-based advertising on other linked devices, and will stop using Device Data from other linked devices for interest-based advertising on the device from which choice was exercised. When such choice is exercised on a device, Factual will also stop using and transferring Device Data from that device for interest-based advertising on other linked devices and will stop using Device Data from other linked devices for interest-based advertising on the device from which choice was exercised. AppChoices is available at the links below:

[DAA AppChoices iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/appchoices/id894822870?mt=8)

[DAA AppChoices Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DAA.appchoices&hl=en)

[DAA AppChoices Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Digital-Advertising-Alliance-AppChoices/dp/B00SVQ4FMO)

Please note that Consumers who use more than one mobile device should renew their opt-out choices on each device. 

Consumers who opt out from use of their Device Data as part of Factual’s Services may continue to receive interest-based advertising from other companies. Additionally, Factual may continue to collect, use, and transfer Device Data for purposes other than interest-based advertising.

#### **c. Opting out of interest-based advertising on websites by Factual’s Customers.**

Factual sometimes works with web-based Customers to coordinate and integrate information across platforms.
