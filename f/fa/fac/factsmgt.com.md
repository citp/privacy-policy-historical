# Privacy Notice ::: FACTS

The Company is committed to providing you a useful and enjoyable online experience, and to protecting your personal information during your visit. When you access a Company Web site (Company Site), you can be sure that your information is protected by the latest security and authentication techniques. We may collect information from your visit, in order to personalize and improve upon your experience with us, but all personally identifiable information we collect is maintained securely.

  To access information and send email via a Company Site, you will need a browser that supports the use of Secure Sockets Layer (Netscape 4.0or greater, MS Internet Explorer 5.0 or greater, etc). This encryption technology helps ensure the authenticity of your online sessions and secures data being transmitted over the public Internet.

  If you are using Netscape Navigator, your session is secured if a key appears in the lower left corner of your screen; when the session is not secure, the key will appear broken. Internet Explorer displays a lock icon in a locked position on the status bar when you enter a secure site. When you leave a secure Web site, Internet Explorer displays a lock in an unlocked position on the status bar. If the page you are viewing uses frames, you may not see the key or lock, but can simply right-click anywhere in the frame and select “Properties”. If the Web site address (URL) starts with “https” the “s” indicates a secure site or area of the site.

  When you enter a Company Site, you will pass through our security “firewall” and we identify the Internet Protocol (IP) address of you computer or handheld device, The IP address won’t identify you personally, but it will let us identify the device you’re using and we store IP addresses in case we need to track a connection for security purposes.

  Company Sites use cookies in several applications for navigational purposes. A cookie is a small text file placed on your hard drive (not on the Company Site) by a Web page server. Cookies make your Internet experience quicker and more convenient.  You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of the Company Sites may not work properly if you do. Accepting a cookie from a Company Site does not give Company access to any of your personally identifiable information. Also, the types of cookies we use don’t get stored permanently in your computer – they expire immediately after you close your browser and are deleted. You may be able to set up your Web browser to inform you when cookies are set or to prevent cookies from being set.

  If you supply us with your email address we may let you know by email about other products and services and product enhancements that may be of interest to you. You will have the opportunity to tell us you don’t want to receive future messages with each message you receive. If you send us an email question or comment, we will use your email address to reply to you and we will temporarily store your email address, your message, and our reply for quality assurance or to satisfy applicable laws and regulations. When we collect your email address this way, we won’t use it for marketing our products and services unless you have given us permission. If you are not comfortable that your email system is secure, you can always contact Customer Service by telephone.

  We don’t knowingly collect, maintain or use personally identifiable information on the Company Sites from children under age 13, unless first complying with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. If we find out we have unknowingly collected such information we will take all reasonable measures to delete that information from our system as soon as possible. We are not responsible for the collection and use of information by companies or individuals unaffiliated with us whose Web sites may contain links to ours, including vendors where you may shop.

  Please note that when you shop with a vendor who is linked to a Company Site, even though you may have started your visit at a Company Site, and even though Company pages may still appear, your transactions are completed with a separate organization, not with us. We don’t share your personally identifiable information with them, but information you choose to share with them will fall under their privacy policies, which we encourage you to review. We carefully select other organizations in an effort to give you the value and excellent customer service you expect from us.
