# Privacy Policy | Socialbakers

This Privacy Policy was last updated in March 2017.

Your privacy is our concern, and we are serious about it. This Privacy Policy explains what type of information Socialbakers a.s., with its registered office at Pod Všemi svatými 427/17, Severní Předměstí, 301 00 Plzeň, Czech Republic, company ID No. 290 98 271, registered in the Companies Register maintained by the Regional Court in Pilsen, file B 1627 (“Socialbakers” or “we”) may collect and hold in connection with your use of any Socialbakers’ products, services, applications, or websites (referred to collectively as the “Services”), and how that information is used and protected. It also sets out how you can contact us if you have any queries or concerns regarding your personal data. 

We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time. Your continued use of our Services which are subject to this Privacy Policy will signify your acceptance of any and all changes to this Privacy Policy made by us from time to time. 

  1. ## [Data that we collect]()

We, Socialbakers, may collect information about you in several different ways. Please take care when submitting information to us – the process of data collection may be automated and we may not recognize that you have provided us with incorrect, incomplete or sensitive data.

We collect your personal data when: 

    * You register or use registration for our Services through Facebook Connect or “Sign in with Twitter” or by any other similar authentication means; 
    * You otherwise interact with Socialbakers, in particular when you use the “Sign In with Facebook” or similar button on our website; and/or 
    * You otherwise voluntarily provide such data, e.g. by registering with your e-mail address and password or by filling out and submitting a form made available to you through Socialbakers’ website or the Services. 

If you log in to our Services using your social network account, we receive basic personal details from your social network profile. The scope of details we receive depends on your social network account privacy settings; however, they might include your social network ID, public profile information (such as name, profile picture, gender, age range, or country), e-mail address, birthday, work history, hometown and current city. We may also receive additional information from your profile if you give us permission to access it. If you wish to change the scope of your social network profile information that we receive upon your registration, you should review the privacy policy or other guidance available on your social network’s website and change your privacy settings. 

We also may collect any personal data concerning you or any third party that you have chosen to make accessible to general public, e.g. through Facebook APIs or YouTube APIs, on various social networks or anywhere else on the internet. 

For purposes of analysis and improvement of our Services, our servers may automatically record information when you visit our website or use some of our Services, including: 

    * URL;
    * IP address;
    * Browser type and language; and
    * Date and time of your request.

If our Services are purchased by an entity, it is the individual users within such entity’s organization who sign for our Services and whose personal data are collected, as described above. Where such entity provides us directly with any personal data of its employees or other individual users that it authorized to access the Services, it must have all necessary consents, permissions or registrations to process and to provide to us its employees’ or users’ personal data. 

  2. ## [How we use the data we collect]()

We may use the personal data (even sensitive data) collected from you through your use of the Services. In addition, we may complement and combine your personal data that you provided to us with data collected from our other Services that you use and with data from publicly available sources. 

Your personal data may be used for the following purposes:

    * To provide the Services to you;
    * For verification purposes (such as determining free trial eligibility);

    * For marketing and sales purposes (see section Marketing communications, below); and
    * For the purposes of product and market statistics, research and analytics, benchmarks and other analyses (see section Anonymous statistic, below). 

We will retain your personal data for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and/or any Services contract, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

These third-party vendors have access to and may collect information only as needed to perform their functions on our behalf and are not permitted to share or use the information for any other purpose.

  6. ## [Security and location of your data]()

We have implemented and will maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures, internal controls, and information security routines in accordance with good industry practice while keeping in mind the state of technological development in order to protect your data against accidental loss, destruction, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access or unlawful destruction. Such measures may include, without limitation, taking reasonable steps to ensure the reliability of employees having access to your data and providing for limited access rights and access controls; authentication; personnel training; regular back up; data recovery and incident management procedures; restrictions on storing, printing and disposal of personal data; software protection of devices on which personal data are stored; etc. 

Upon request, we will provide further details about the measures implemented by us and our data service providers.

Data collected from you may be transferred to, and stored and processed in, the United States (US) or any other country in which Socialbakers, its affiliates, subcontractors, suppliers or other third party vendors maintain facilities. While we reserve the right to change our business partners and /or data locations, when we transfer any personal data to the USA or any other country outside the EU or EEA in which Socialbakers, its affiliates, subcontractors, suppliers or vendors maintain facilities, we will implement such appropriate legal mechanism as are required by EU law to ensure an adequate level of personal data protection by such third parties receiving your personal data (for example, European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses). 

In addition to our current vendors listed in Section 3, the production data from our Services are currently transferred to and stored and processed by Amazon Web Services, Inc., 410 Terry Avenue, Seattle, WA 98109 (“AWS”). Socialbakers and AWS have signed the controller-to-processor Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission (2010/87/EU) to ensure regulatory compliance for data transfers from Europe to the USA. The specific AWS Data Processing Addendum incorporating these model clauses has been approved and validated on EU level by Article 29 Working Party in 2015 as ensuring an adequate level of protection. See [ https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_EU_Data_Protection_Whitepaper_EN.pdf](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_EU_Data_Protection_Whitepaper_EN.pdf) and [ http://www.cnpd.public.lu/en/actualites/international/2015/03/AWS/index.html](http://www.cnpd.public.lu/en/actualites/international/2015/03/AWS/index.html) for more details.
