        <h2>FEN Learning Values Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>FEN Learning, Inc. ("FEN") operates this website ("Website") and is committed to protecting the privacy and security of its online visitors. This privacy statement tells you about the types of information that we collect from you, how we collect that information from you and how we use that information, in each case when you use this Website.</p>
        <p>We encourage our visitors to read through and understand this privacy statement. We may update it from time to time to address new issues or reflect changes on our Website. Please refer to this privacy statement regularly. FEN reserves the right to revise this privacy statement at any time and such revisions shall be effective immediately upon notice thereof. Notice may be given by any means including, but not limited to, posting the revised privacy statement on this Website. Any use of our site by you subsequent to such notice shall be deemed to constitute acceptance by you of such revision.</p>
        <p>For material changes to this privacy statement that may affect the collection or use of personal information from children (from children under the age of 13 only with prior verifiable consent from a parent or guardian), we will notify and obtain the prior verifiable consent of a parent or legal guardian. <a href="http://www.fen.com/privacy-policy-children.html#childrens-privacy">See our practices regarding children below</a>.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect From You</h2>
        <p>When you use this Website, we may collect anonymized information from you. Anonymized information means information that does not or could not reasonably be used to identify a specific individual. The Website does not currently collect personal information from users (personal information means information that would identify you, directly or indirectly, such as your name, mailing address, email address or telephone number).</p>
        <p>We also collect anonymized information from your computer or device such as browser type, operating system, referring pages, pages visited, time spent on a particular page and IP address.</p>
        <h2>How We Collect Your Information</h2>
        <p>When you use this website, we collect anonymized information through a variety of methods. We collect anonymized information from you by using technologies like cookies, web beacons and server logs. This Website contains cookies from FEN and third parties. While browsing through this Website, you may get cookies from our advertisers or sponsors. FEN does not control these cookies.</p>
        <p>We may also use single pixels images, web beacons and other similar technology (collectively "Beacons") to (a) track your usage of the Website, and (b) identify certain information on how and when you accessed the Website such as type of browser, operating system, domain names, IP addresses and the like.</p>
        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>When visitors request pages from FEN sites, our servers log users' IP addresses. We typically do not link IP addresses to any personal information. This means that a visitor's session will be logged, but the visitor remains anonymous to us.</p>
        <p>FEN collects IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, sponsors, and partners, and to audit the use of our site. We will use IP addresses to identify a user in the following situations: (a) in response to subpoenas, court orders or legal process, to the extent permitted and as restricted by law; (b) when disclosure is required to maintain the security and integrity of this site, or to protect any user's security or the security of other persons, consistent with applicable laws.</p>
        <p>FEN collects IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, sponsors, and partners, and to audit the use of our site.  We will use IP addresses to identify a user in the following situations: (a) in response to subpoenas, court orders or legal process, to the extent permitted and as restricted by law; (b) when disclosure is required to maintain the security and integrity of this site, or to protect any user's security or the security of other persons, consistent with applicable laws.</p>
        <p>The anonymized information we track with cookies is not used to identify, or lead us back to, any particular visitor. Visitors to this Website may have the option of disabling cookies via their browser preferences (most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies). Cookies make our Website easier for you to use because they save your preferences while you are visiting our sites (although we do not save passwords in cookies). Cookies also help us know which areas are your favorites, which areas need improvement, and what technologies and Internet services our visitors are using. Knowing this information helps us continually improve the online experience for our visitors and members.</p>
        <p>FEN may also use third party vendors who supply applications, web hosting and other technologies for this Website that may have access to anonymized information but they will never use such information for any other purpose except to provide services in connection with this site.</p>
        <p>FEN may also use persistent identifiers on this Website to support the internal operations which include: maintaining and analyzing the functioning of the Website; performing network communications; authenticating users; personalizing content on the Website; serving contextual advertising or capping the frequency of advertising; protecting the security or integrity of the user, Website or service; and to ensure legal and regulatory compliance. A "persistent identifier" is a series of numbers that we assign to a user but cannot be reasonably used to identify a specific user.</p>
        <h2>Do Not Track</h2>
        <p>This Website does not respond to your browser's (or app's) "do-not-track" signals or comparable signals or mechanisms. Please check our Privacy Statement frequently as this may change in the future.</p>
        <h2>Helpful Explanations</h2>
        <p>An IP address is a number that is assigned automatically to your computer whenever you use the World Wide Web. Web servers -- the big computers that "serve up" Web pages -- automatically identify your computer by its IP address.</p>
        <p>The use of "cookies" is common in the Internet industry; you will find them used on this Website, as you will at other major websites. "Cookies" are small text files written to your computer. For more information about cookies please go <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="childrens-privacy">Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>FEN encourages parents and guardians to supervise their child's use of the Internet. We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses, phone numbers, or other personal information without a parent's or guardian's permission when using the Internet. We recognize a special obligation to protect personal information obtained from children. For this reason, this Website does not currently collect personal information from users (personal information means information that would identify you, directly or indirectly, such as your name, mailing address, email address or telephone number).</p>
        <p>As a parent, you've probably done a lot of thinking about protecting your family's privacy on the Internet. We have been thinking and working hard to provide you with the best information and the highest quality interaction on the Internet in an environment that is safe. In compliance with COPPA (the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act), we have adopted the following policies to keep kids safe <b>(there are exceptions to these policies as noted below under the heading "Exceptions to Verifiable Parental Consent and Information Collected from Children")</b>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We will NOT knowingly collect personal information from users using this Website.</li>
            <li>We will NOT knowingly provide any direct link to websites that are unsuitable for children or teens.
            </li>
            <li>We will NOT knowingly collect, use, or distribute personal information from children under the age of 13 without prior verifiable consent from a parent or guardian.
            </li>
            <li>We will NOT knowingly allow children under the age of 13 access to free form chat, message boards, email accounts, or other services within FEN that would allow them to publicly post or otherwise distribute personal information without prior verifiable consent from a parent or guardian.
            </li>
            <li>We will NOT knowingly ask a child under the age of 13 to divulge more information than is needed to participate in any activity, game, or service.
            </li>
            <li>We will NOT knowingly keep any personal information that is inadvertently included in a child's email submission, help inquiry, or other one-time request, if we know that the child is under the age of 13. Any such information will be purged promptly after the issue has been resolved.
            </li>
            <li>We will NOT knowingly post any personal information that is inadvertently included in a child's submission to a general audience contribution area if we know that the child is under the age of 13. Upon notice to us, these submissions will be deleted and handled anonymously thereafter.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>About Our Advertisers:</h2>
        <p>This Website allows advertising by third parties. FEN does not control the linking practices of advertisers or sponsors and does not monitor or claim responsibility for any content or privacy practices of such websites. Once you have clicked on an advertisement and have left this Website, you must read the privacy policy of the advertiser or sponsor to see how your personal information will be handled.</p>
        <p>FEN may use advertising servers developed by third parties to display ads on this Website. Some of these ads may contain cookies that are set by third parties (advertisers, sponsors) and may use anonymized information (not including your name, address, email address, telephone number) about your visits to this and other sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. We do not have access to these cookies or any information that they transmit. The FEN privacy statement does not cover any use of information that a third-party ad server may have collected from you. Please note that FEN does not engage in the practice of showing or tracking users for interest-based advertisements on its child-directed sites.</p>
        <p>For more information on ad serving, please go to http://www.allaboutcookies.org/ad-serving/. If you would like to know your choices about not having information used by these third parties, please go to: <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/what-are-my-options">http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/what-are-my-options.</a></p>
        <h2>A Notice About External Links</h2>
        <p>Occasionally, you will find links from FEN to independently owned, controlled, and/or managed Websites whose content we believe will be of possible interest and value to our visitors. Additionally, you'll see links from advertisers, sponsors, and other partners who may use a FEN owned logo as part of a co-branding agreement.</p>
        <p>In many cases, these links represent cooperative projects or mutual links established with the organizations connected with these sites. We do not control the content of these links. These other sites may send you their own cookies, collect data, or solicit personal information. While we identify sponsor and advertiser areas of our Websites, we do not control these cookies or the content of these third parties.</p>
        <p>FEN has partnered with other companies to provide certain services. In some cases, you may see a FEN owned logo on another company's site. FEN does not share any of your personal information with these partners and they do not share any information with us.</p>
        <p> Once you leave our servers (you can generally tell where you are by checking the URL in the location bar on your browser), the use of any information collected from you is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting. That policy may differ from ours. If you cannot find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link from that site's Home page, you should contact the site directly for more information.</p>
        <p>We specifically recommend that children check with their parents, guardians, or teachers before connecting to any third party sites.</p>
        <h2>Security:</h2>
        <p>FEN has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. Essentially, we encrypt all transmission of sensitive data and secure all of our repositories of data. Our servers use encryption technology to safeguard your personal information and privacy. However, you should understand that "perfect security" cannot be guaranteed.</p>
