This privacy statement tells you about the types of information that we collect from you, how we collect that information from you and how we use that information. We also describe the measures we take to protect the security of the information and how you can contact us about our privacy practices.\n\nWe encourage our visitors to read through and understand our privacy statement. We may update it from time to time to address new issues or reflect changes on our Website. Please refer to this privacy statement regularly. FEN reserves the right to revise this privacy statement at any time and such revisions shall be effective immediately upon notice thereof.

Please check our Privacy Statement frequently as this may change in the future.\n\n \n\nChildren\u0027s Privacy\n\nFEN encourages parents and guardians to supervise their child\u0027s use of the Internet. We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses, phone numbers, or other personal information without a parent\u0027s or guardian\u0027s permission when using the Internet. We recognize a special obligation to protect personal information obtained from children. For this reason, FEN generally does not request, collect, or store any personal information knowingly from children under 13.\n\nAs a parent, you\u0027ve probably done a lot of thinking about protecting your family\u0027s privacy on the Internet. We have been thinking and working hard to provide you with the best information and the highest quality interaction on the Internet in an environment that is safe. In compliance with COPPA (the Children\u0027s Online Privacy Protection Act), we have adopted the following policies to keep kids safe (there are exceptions to these policies as noted below under the heading \u0022Exceptions to Verifiable Parental Consent and Information Collected from Children\u0022):\n\nWe will NOT knowingly collect, use, or distribute personal information from children under the age of 13 without prior verifiable consent from a parent or guardian.\n\tPersonal information we collect from children under the age of 13 will be used solely by FEN or its agents for internal purposes only and will NOT be sold or otherwise distributed to third parties.\n\tWe will NOT knowingly allow children under the age of 13 access to free form chat, message boards, email accounts, or other services within FEN that would allow them to publicly post or otherwise distribute personal information without prior verifiable consent from a parent or guardian.\n\tWe will NOT knowingly ask a child under the age of 13 to divulge more information than is needed to participate in any activity, game, or service.\n\tWe will NOT knowingly keep any personal information that is inadvertently included in a child\u0027s email submission, help inquiry, or other one-time request, if we know that the child is under the age of 13. Any such information will be purged promptly after the issue has been resolved.\n\tWe will NOT knowingly post any personal information that is inadvertently included in a child\u0027s submission to a general audience contribution area if we know that the child is under the age of 13. Upon notice to us, these submissions will be deleted and handled anonymously thereafter.\n\tWe will NOT knowingly provide any direct link to websites that are unsuitable for children or teens.\n\tWe will advise children under the age of 13 that they MUST obtain permission from their parent or guardian before sharing ANY personal information.\n\tUpon request, FEN will provide a parent or guardian with a description of the information that may have been provided about their child during a registration process for a program or service of this site. FEN only asks for a child\u0027s or teen\u0027s personal information if it is necessary to participate in an activity, game or service. If we have collected and stored personal information from a child, we will give parents the ability to review their child\u0027s personal information, request that we discontinue further collection or use of their child\u0027s personal information, and/or request that we delete their child\u0027s personal information.\n \n\nNotification and Verifiable Parental Consent:\n\nBefore any personal information is collected from a child under the age of 13, we will use reasonable efforts to notify the parent or guardian that their child is participating. Notification will include the exact nature and intended use of the information we are collecting, as well as the opportunity for the parent or guardian to prevent the use of the information and the child\u0027s participation in the activity. For every child under the age of 13, we will also require the parent or guardian to provide verifiable parental consent such as: by email plus a fax, phone or letter follow up by the parent or guardian; mail, fax or scan of a consent form; or toll-free phone call to FEN; or other acceptable method.\n\nIn order for us to provide notice to a parent or guardian and seek verifiable parental consent, we may request the online contact information of a parent or guardian. \n\n \n\nExceptions to Verifiable Parental Consent and Information Collected From Children:\n\nIn the following instances we will NOT get verifiable parental consent for the collection of a child\u0027s personal information:\n\nCollecting a child\u0027s contact information solely to directly respond to the child\u0027s request on a one-time basis (for example, to provide assistance with a particular customer service question). We will not use that information to re-contact the child for any other purpose (we will purge from our system the child\u0027s personal information after responding);\n\tCollecting a child\u0027s contact information and the contact information of his/her parent or guardian solely to directly respond more than once to a specific request from the child (for example, to satisfy the request for a newsletter subscription). In this instance, the parent or guardian will be notified that the child made such a request and be informed of the information provided by the child. The parent or guardian will have an opportunity at any time to revoke the child\u0027s request (i.e., unsubscribe). We will not use the child\u0027s personal information to re-contact the child for any other purpose.\n\tUsing persistent identifiers on our Website to support the internal operations of our Website which include: maintaining and analyzing the functioning of the Website; performing network communications; authenticating users; personalizing content on the Website; serving contextual advertising or capping the frequency of advertising; protecting the security or integrity of the user, Website or service; and to ensure legal and regulatory compliance. A \u0022persistent identifier\u0022 is a series of numbers that we assign to a user but cannot be reasonably used to identify a specific user.\n\tA child may provide the email address of their parent or guardian for the purpose of retrieving or resetting a child\u0027s lost password for their user account.\n \n\nAbout Our Advertisers:\n\nThis Website allows advertising by third parties. FEN does not control the linking practices of advertisers or sponsors and does not monitor or claim responsibility for any content or privacy practices of such websites. Once you have clicked on an advertisement and have left this Website, you must read the privacy policy of the advertiser or sponsor to see how your information will be handled.\n\nFEN may offer contests, sweepstakes, and promotions that are sponsored by third-party advertisers or sponsors. These third parties may obtain personal information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the activity. FEN does not control the third parties\u0027 use of information.\n\nFEN may use advertising servers developed by third parties to display ads on this Website. Some of these ads may contain cookies that are set by third parties (advertisers, sponsors) and may use anonymized information (not including your name, address, email address, telephone number) about your visits to this and other sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. We do not have access to these cookies or any information that they transmit. The FEN privacy statement does not cover any use of information that a third-party ad server may have collected from you. Please note that FEN does not engage in the practice of showing or tracking users for interest-based advertisements on its child-directed sites.\n\nFor more information on ad serving, please go to http://www.allaboutcookies.org/ad-serving/ . If you would like to know your choices about not having information used by these third parties, please go to:http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/what-are-my-options .\n\n \n\nA Notice About External Links\n\nOccasionally, you will find links from FEN to independently owned, controlled, and/or managed Websites whose content we believe will be of possible interest and value to our visitors. Additionally, you\u0027ll see links from advertisers, sponsors, and other partners who may use a FEN owned logo as part of a co-branding agreement.\n\nIn many cases, these links represent cooperative projects or mutual links established with the organizations connected with these sites. We do not control the content of these links. These other sites may send you their own cookies, collect data, or solicit personal information. While we identify sponsor and advertiser areas of our Websites, we do not control these cookies or the content of these third parties.\n\nFEN has partnered with other companies to provide certain services. In some cases, you may see a FEN owned logo on another company\u0027s site. FEN does not share any of your personal information with these partners and they do not share any information with us.\n\nOnce you leave our servers (you can generally tell where you are by checking the URL in the location bar on your browser), the use of any information collected from you is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting. That policy may differ from ours. If you cannot find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link from that site\u0027s Home page, you should contact the site directly for more information.\n\nWe specifically recommend that children check with their parents, guardians, or teachers before connecting to any third party sites.\n\n \n\nSecurity\n\nFEN has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. Essentially, we encrypt all transmission of sensitive data and secure all of our repositories of data. The data transferred to our third party payment processors when you use your credit card to make a purchase transaction with us will be transferred using our encrypted technology to safeguard your personal information and privacy. However, you should understand that \u0022perfect security\u0022 cannot be guaranteed.\n\n \n\nIndividuals Located in the European Union: Your Rights and Choices \n\nIf you are a resident of the European Union or provide personal information through this Website while located in the European Union, the below provides additional information affecting your rights and choices.  \n\nIf you are a resident of the European Union or provide personal information through this Website while located in the European Union, we offer you certain choices in connection with the personal information that we collect from you on this Website. \n\nUsers in the European Union may have the right under certain circumstances:\n\nto be provided with a copy of your personal information held by us;\n\tto request the rectification or erasure of your personal information held by us;\n\tto request that we cease processing your personal information;\n\tto request that we restrict the processing of your personal information (while we verify or investigate your concerns with this information, for example);\n\tto request that your data be transferred to a third party.\nYou can exercise the rights listed above at any time by contacting us as indicated in the “How To Contact Us” section of this privacy statement. We will apply your preferences going forward. You agree that if you exercise any of the rights listed above (except to receive a copy of your personal information), you may no longer and will no longer access the Website, and we will no longer provide any services associated with the Website (if any) to you.\n\nIf your request or concern is not satisfactorily resolved by us, you may approach your local data protection authority, (to locate your data protection authority see http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.html ).\n\n \n\nCross-Border Transfer of Data\n\nAny personal information you provide to FEN in connection with this Website will be stored on FEN\u0027s servers or those of its affiliates and/or authorized vendors and will be accessible by authorized employees, agents and contractors of FEN and its affiliates and authorized vendors. Due to the global nature of the Website, personal information may be transmitted, stored or processed in a country other than the one in which you reside (\u0022Resident Jurisdiction\u0022), including primarily in the United States, the European Union and India. Reasonable contractual or other measures FEN may take to protect your personal information while outside the Resident Jurisdiction are subject to applicable foreign legal requirements, for example, lawful requirements by governmental authorities or court order to disclose personally identifiable information to government authorities in the countries in which such data may be stored or processed.

In compliance with COPPA (the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act), we have adopted the following policies to keep kids safe (there are exceptions to these policies as noted below under the heading "Exceptions to Verifiable Parental Consent and Information Collected from Children"):</span></p><ul><li><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">We will NOT knowingly collect, use, or distribute personal information from children under the age of 13 without prior verifiable consent from a parent or guardian.</span></span></li><li><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">Personal information we collect from children under the age of 13 will be used solely by FEN or its agents for internal purposes only and will NOT be sold or otherwise distributed to third parties.</span></span></li><li><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">We will NOT knowingly allow children under the age of 13 access to free form chat, message boards, email accounts, or other services within FEN that would allow them to publicly post or otherwise distribute personal information without prior verifiable consent from a parent or guardian.</span></span></li><li><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">We will NOT knowingly ask a child under the age of 13 to divulge more information than is needed to participate in any activity, game, or service.</span></span></li><li><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">We will NOT knowingly keep any personal information that is inadvertently included in a child's email submission, help inquiry, or other one-time request, if we know that the child is under the age of 13. Any such information will be purged promptly after the issue has been resolved.</span></span></li><li><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">We will NOT knowingly post any personal information that is inadvertently included in a child's submission to a general audience contribution area if we know that the child is under the age of 13. Upon notice to us, these submissions will be deleted and handled anonymously thereafter.</span></span></li><li><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">We will NOT knowingly provide any direct link to websites that are unsuitable for children or teens.</span></span></li><li><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">We will advise children under the age of 13 that they MUST obtain permission from their parent or guardian before sharing ANY personal information.</span></span></li><li><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">Upon request, FEN will provide a parent or guardian with a description of the information that may have been provided about their child during a registration process for a program or service of this site. FEN only asks for a child's or teen's personal information if it is necessary to participate in an activity, game or service. If we have collected and stored personal information from a child, we will give parents the ability to review their child's personal information, request that we discontinue further collection or use of their child's personal information, and/or request that we delete their child's personal information.</span></span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">Notification and Verifiable Parental Consent:</span></strong></p><p><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">Before any personal information is collected from a child under the age of 13, we will use reasonable efforts to notify the parent or guardian that their child is participating. Notification will include the exact nature and intended use of the information we are collecting, as well as the opportunity for the parent or guardian to prevent the use of the information and the child's participation in the activity. For every child under the age of 13, we will also require the parent or guardian to provide verifiable parental consent such as: by email plus a fax, phone or letter follow up by the parent or guardian; mail, fax or scan of a consent form; or toll-free phone call to FEN; or other acceptable method.</span></p><p><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">In order for us to provide notice to a parent or guardian and seek verifiable parental consent, we may request the online contact information of a parent or guardian. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">Exceptions to Verifiable Parental Consent and Information Collected From Children:</span></strong></p><p><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">In the following instances we will NOT get verifiable parental consent for the collection of a child's personal information:</span></p><ul><li><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">Collecting a child's contact information solely to directly respond to the child's request on a one-time basis (for example, to provide assistance with a particular customer service question). We will not use that information to re-contact the child for any other purpose (we will purge from our system the child's personal information after responding);</span></span></li><li><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">Collecting a child's contact information and the contact information of his/her parent or guardian solely to directly respond more than once to a specific request from the child (for example, to satisfy the request for a newsletter subscription). In this instance, the parent or guardian will be notified that the child made such a request and be informed of the information provided by the child. The parent or guardian will have an opportunity at any time to revoke the child's request (i.e., unsubscribe). We will not use the child's personal information to re-contact the child for any other purpose.</span></span></li><li><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">Using persistent identifiers on our Website to support the internal operations of our Website which include: maintaining and analyzing the functioning of the Website; performing network communications; authenticating users; personalizing content on the Website; serving contextual advertising or capping the frequency of advertising; protecting the security or integrity of the user, Website or service; and to ensure legal and regulatory compliance.
