<ol class="mainList">
<li>
<h2>The Information Factual Collects</h2>
<p>
In order to use the Site or Services, users must register with the site and in the process we may collect certain user-provided, personally identifiable information including name and email address.

</p>
<p>
We may assign your computer one or more cookies which may collect information to facilitate access to our website and to personalize your online experience.  We may use standard Internet tools, such web beacons, which collect information that tracks your use of our website and enables us to customize our services and advertisements.
</p>
<p>
We allow registered users to send invitations to their friends. We use your friends’ email addresses to send them these invitations, and we retain their addresses for the purpose of identifying them when they come to our site. Unless they register with the site, we do not send them any other emails or use their email address for any other purpose.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h2>The Way Factual Uses Information</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Factual uses the information that you provide or that we collect to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide all of the features and services found on the Site and Services as well as to track user-generated content and Users to the extent necessary to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
</li>
<li>
We will use your email address, without further consent, for administrative communications such as notifying you of major Site and Services updates, for customer service purposes, to address copyright infringement or defamation issues, or to contact you regarding any content that you have posted to or downloaded from the Site or Services.
</li>
<li>
Factual uses all of the information that we collect to understand the usage trends and preferences of our Users, to improve the way the Site or Services works and looks, and to create new features and functionality.
</li>
<li>
Factual may use “Automatically Collected” information and “Cookies” information to: (a) automatically update the Factual application on your system; (b) remember your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you access the Factual Platform; (c) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages accessed; (d) provide such metrics to Users as they pertain to such User’s uploaded content; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h2>When Factual Discloses Information</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Factual does not share your information with other organizations for their marketing or promotional uses without your prior express consent. Please be aware, however, that any information that you voluntarily choose to display on the Site or Services – such as when you publish attribution credits for documents or profile information – becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by others without restriction.
</li>
<li>
We may disclose User information to affiliated companies or other businesses or persons to: provide web site hosting, maintenance, and security services; fulfill orders; conduct data analysis and create reports; offer certain functionality; and assist Factual in improving the Site or Services and creating new services features. We require that these parties process such information in compliance with this Privacy Notice, we authorize only a limited use of such information, and we require these parties to use reasonable confidentiality measures.
