<p>
Factual values the privacy of its customers and consumers.  Factual’s customers include clients of Factual’s Services (defined below), third parties (e.g., publishers) that provide data to Factual, as well as brands, advertising agencies, application developers, media and technology platforms, and others who visit any Factual website that links to this policy (“Site”) or otherwise use Factual’s Services (collectively “Customers”).  “Consumers” include individuals who use Factual’s applications or who use applications from which Factual receives or collects data (such as applications that are owned and/or operated by Factual’s Customers).
</p>
<p>
Factual provides both location and point of interest data (i.e. data that matches places to location coordinates) to its Customers and offers a variety of services that use this data.  Some of Factual’s services rely solely on point of interest data and other types of data that do not pertain to an individual or device, while other services involve the use of data collected from or associated with specific Consumer devices (“Device Data” as further defined below).  This Privacy Policy relates only to (a) Factual’s services that involve the use of Device Data (“Services”) and (b) Factual’s collection and use of information obtained through Factual’s Site and applications as well as in connection with Factual client accounts.
</p>
<p>
This Privacy Policy does not apply to companies that Factual does not own or control, including Factual’s Customers.  To learn more about how Factual’s Customers collect, use, and disclose information about consumers, please visit the Customers’ privacy policies.

<h2>The Consumer Information Factual Collects for the Services</h2>
<p>
When Consumers use Factual applications or engage with our Customers (e.g., by using their mobile applications or viewing an ad provided by our Customers, or by using an app that has integrated our software development kit (“SDK”)), we may collect or receive Device Data that may (but does not necessarily) include the following:
</p><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>
Consumers' names if Consumers choose to provide this through the Factual applications;
</li>
<li>
Precise geolocation data pertaining to Consumers’ devices, which may be expressed by latitude-longitude coordinates obtained through GPS tools, WiFi data, cell tower triangulation or other techniques (collectively, “Device Geolocation Data”) and linked to a device identifier, such as the IDFA for iOS devices or Android ID for Android devices;
</li>
<li>
Predicted or actual data about a Consumer such as age, gender, date of birth, street address; predicted or actual characteristics or interests; and any information that Consumers provide to Factual or to Factual’s Customers;
</li>
<li>
Other information about a Consumer’s device, such as: device type (e.g., tablet, smartphone), operating system, IP address, network provider, mobile carrier, mobile browser type (e.g., Firefox, Chrome, Safari), other apps and SDKs installed on the device, timestamp,  time zone, information about the speed, bearing, orientation, and altitude of a device, or other device-identifying information;
</li>
<li>
Information about the possible relationships among different devices; and/or
</li>
<li>
Data about Consumer activities that helps Factual determine how a Consumer interacts with advertising or content, such as determining whether a Consumer who viewed a particular advertisement ultimately purchased the advertised product or service.
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>
The Device Data that Factual receives from its Customers or from Consumers may be combined with additional information Factual collects or receives from third-party sources.  For example, Factual may have information about consumer products, events held at specific locations, street addresses, and categories of geographic locations or points of interest.  While such information is associated with a specific device, it is treated as Device Data.
</p>
<p>
Please see <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a> below for a description of the information that Factual collects through its Site and in connection with Factual accounts.
</p>
</li>
<li id="section-2">
<h2>How Factual Uses Device Data to Provide the Services</h2>
<p>
Factual generally uses the Device Data it collects or receives for the following purposes:
</p><ul>
<li>
to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide the Services described below; and
</li>
<li>
to improve and market the Services, and to create new features and functionality.
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
Factual’s Services help application developers, publishers, advertisers, marketers, and other companies and organizations learn more about Consumers based on Device Data including Device Geolocation Data.  For example, the Services help Customers:
</p><ul>
<li>
provide more relevant content or advertising to Consumers over time and across multiple devices;
</li>
<li>
identify other Consumers that may be interested in their offerings;
</li>
<li>
measure the performance of Customers’ content, services, and advertising (for instance, what effect certain ads, as opposed to other ads, have), or trends or preferences among Consumers (for instance, what types of Consumers generally tend to shop at certain stores); or
</li>
<li>
learn about how Customers’ apps can perform better.
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
Factual may also work with third parties, such as brands, advertising agencies, media platforms and publishers (such as app developers), and other advertising platforms to improve their own services. The above list is not exhaustive, but it is intended to provide illustrative examples of how Factual uses the Device Data it collects and receives.
</p>
<p>
Factual provides Customers with standard segments based on health-related interests or information, to deliver interest-based advertisements and for other purposes; these segments are based on data that is not considered sensitive under the Network Advertising Initiative Codes of Conduct. For a complete list of such non-sensitive health segments, please click <a href="/privacy/health-segments">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
Factual may retain the Device Data:
</p><ul>
<li>
as needed for interest-based advertising, ad delivery, and reporting purposes for up to approximately 24 months after Factual's last observation of the device identifier;
</li>
<li>
for other business purposes (such as technical developments) for such period as Factual considers reasonably necessary.
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
After this Factual will delete or de-identify the Device Data. However, Factual may retain Device Data beyond these time periods as required by law.
</p>
</li>
<li id="section-3">
<h2>How Factual Discloses Information Through the Services</h2>
<p>
As part of the Services, Factual may provide Device Data and information derived from Device Data to Customers and other third parties. The use of Device Data by Factual’s Customers and other third parties is not covered by this Privacy Policy. Some of these Customers and other third parties may use cookies or web beacons (pixels) in order to send targeted ads to Consumers, engage with Consumers, or otherwise locate Consumers. For more information about cookies and web beacons (pixels), please review the relevant parts of <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>.
</p>
<p>
In addition:
</p><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>
Factual may disclose Device Data if it believes that such action is necessary to comply with applicable laws or regulatory investigations, or to respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, warrant, or law enforcement request.
</li>
<li>
Factual may also disclose Device Data if it believes it will help to protect Factual, its Customers, or any other person or third party, or to enforce any legal rights.
</li>
<li>
In the event that Factual is acquired by or merged with a third-party entity or is potentially going to be acquired by or merged with a third-party entity, in any partial or total sale of assets including in the event of bankruptcy, or in any other corporate change, Factual may transfer or assign the Device Data as part of that actual or potential merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.
</li>
<li>
Factual may share Device Data with its affiliates and joint venture partners.
</li>
<li>
Factual may share Device Data with service providers that help it operate the Services.

<h2>Consumer Choices and How to Opt Out of Interest-Based Advertising</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li id="section-4a">
<strong>Opting Out of Interest-Based Advertising Services by Factual</strong>
<p>
Factual is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and adheres to the NAI Codes of Conduct as described on the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank">NAI website</a>. Factual also adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Self-Regulatory Principles. For a description of the DAA Program, please visit the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/" target="_blank">DAA website</a>. As described above, Factual may use or transfer Device Data that it directly collects or that it receives from Factual’s Customers, who may use cookies or non-cookie technologies, to enable advertising that is more tailored to Consumers’ inferred interests, preferences, and locations.  This practice is known as interest-based advertising.  Factual may also collect, use or transfer Device Data collected from one device for interest-based advertising on other devices that may be linked to the device where data was collected.  This is known as cross-device linking.
</p>
<p>
Factual, and some of Factual’s Customers, provide the ability for Consumers to opt out of the collection and use of mobile app data across apps over time on a device, for interest-based advertising purposes, through the DAA’s AppChoices tool. To opt out of Factual’s collection, use, and transfer of such app usage data and of Device Geolocation Data, for interest-based advertising purposes, Consumers can download AppChoices onto the relevant mobile device and exercise choice through the app.  When such choice is exercised on a device, Factual will also stop using and transferring Device Data from that device for interest-based advertising on other linked devices, and will stop using Device Data from other linked devices for interest-based advertising on the device from which choice was exercised.  AppChoices is available at the links below:
</p>

<br>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Digital-Advertising-Alliance-AppChoices/dp/B00SVQ4FMO" target="_blank">DAA AppChoices Amazon</a>
</p>
<p>
Please note that Consumers who use more than one mobile device should renew their opt-out choices on each device.  Consumers who opt out from use of their Device Data as part of Factual’s Services may continue to receive interest-based advertising from other companies.
</p>
<p>
Consumers who have downloaded Factual’s applications, but who no longer wish to provide information to Factual for interest-based advertising purposes, should opt out through AppChoices as described above.

<strong>What is the legal basis on which Factual relies to process personal data?</strong>
<br>
On some occasions, Factual may process personal data with the individual’s consent (for example, when a User agrees that Factual may place cookies, or process information that the User inputs into the Factual website).
</p>
<p>
On other occasions, Factual may process personal data when Factual needs to do this to fulfil a contract (for example, for billing purposes) or where Factual is required to do this by law.
</p>
<p>
Factual also processes a User’s/Consumer data when it is in Factual's or its Customer's legitimate interests to do this and when these interests are not overridden by the individual’s data protection rights. Those legitimate interests include providing services to enable Factual’s Customers to provide more relevant ads and content.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Who is responsible for the data?</strong>
<br>
For the majority of the services it offers, Factual, Inc. is a data processor who processes data on behalf of its Customers.
</p>
<p>
For certain other services for which Factual is a data controller and for processing of personal data derived from the Site, Factual, Inc. is the data controller of the data.
</p>

If you have any questions or comments please contact Factual at the contact details set out at <a href="#section-11">Section 11</a> below.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Your rights</strong>
<br>
You may ask Factual for a copy of your information, to correct it, erase it, and to transfer it to other organisations at your request. You also have rights to object to some processing and, where Factual has asked for your consent to process your data, to withdraw this consent. Factual will only send marketing to you, if you have indicated that you are happy to receive marketing information from us. In addition, you have rights to object to direct marketing at any time. Where Factual processes your data because Factual has a legitimate interest in doing so (as explained above), you also have a right to object to this. These rights may be limited in some situations – for example, where Factual can demonstrate that it has a legal requirement to process your data.
</p>
<p>
Factual hopes to satisfy queries you may have about the way Factual processes your data. For details on how to opt-out of Factual's interest-based advertising services, please see <a href="#section-4a">Section 4(a)</a> above.
</p>
<p>
However, if you have unresolved concerns you may also have the right to make a complaint to the relevant data protection supervisory authority or to seek a remedy through the courts if you believe that your rights have been breached.
