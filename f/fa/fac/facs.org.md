# Privacy Policy

Last Updated: August 22, 2014

The American College of Surgeons ("ACS,", “we,” or “us”) knows that you care how your information is used and shared. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes our policies with respect to information that ACS collects through the website at www.facs.org ("Website"). 

By visiting www.facs.org you are accepting the practices described in this Policy.

Privacy Policy Support.  If you have an inquiry or concern about our Policy, please contact us using the contact information below.

Changes in this Policy.  ACS may amend this Policy at any time without notice.  Changes to this Policy may affect our use of personally identifiable information that you provided us prior to our notification to you of the changes.  Please visit our Website to obtain current information about our Policy.

ACS uses various technologies to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of information volunteered or collected from users of the Website. We do not require anyone to divulge any personally identifiable information to use the Website. ACS on occasion requires a user to register, when for example certain products are purchased. ACS will not collect personal information about you unless the information is provided voluntarily by you.

**I. Information ACS Collects**

The information we collect generally includes: (1) personal information you supply and (2) tracking information collected as you navigate through the Website.

Information Collected from You   
We may collect and store personally identifiable information that you provide to us.  The personally identifiable information we request from you may include your: (i) country of residence; (ii) first, middle, and last name; (iii) age and date of birth; (iv) highest level of education attained; (v) job title; (vi) home or office phone and fax numbers; (vii) employer's name and address; (viii) home or office address; (ix) home or office e-mail address; (x) ACS member identification number, user ID, and password; and (xi) credit card information (only if purchases are made).

Information Collected Through Technology   
Primarily to tailor the Website to your needs, ACS collects information using technology, such as IP addresses and cookies. For example, your IP address provides ACS with non-personally identifiable information about how you entered the Internet, namely through your Internet service provider, your company, or some other source, and can permit ACS to identify the frequency with which you visit the Website. Standard features in Internet browser software such as "cookies" allow Websites to track certain user activities by assigning each of our visitors a unique number that resides on your computer. ACS uses cookies to make the Website more interesting and useful (for example, cookies let us know which of our sites you have been visiting and which you have not).

Information Is Not Collected Online from Children Under 13   
ACS does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information online from children under the age of 13.

**II. How ACS Uses That Information**

ACS uses your personally identifiable information for the purposes for which it was submitted.  For example, ACS uses the information collected to enable a user to: (i) purchase ACS educational materials for purposes of obtaining Continuing Medical Education ("CME") credit, (ii) pay membership dues, (iii) make Political Action Committee and charitable contributions, (iv) to purchase other ACS products, (v) to receive ACS newsletters and product and/or service announcements, and (vi) to participate in ACS sponsored meetings, programs, and activities.  We do not undertake to maintain any information about you for a duration greater than necessary to provide services to you or as provided by law, rule or regulation.

In the event that you choose to participate in the ACS directory you acknowledge that your  name, location, contact information(phone number, e-mail address), specialty, subspecialty, education and training, areas of clinical concentration, hospital appointments, academic appointments, society memberships, date of birth, and gender) will be available to search, access and view by the general public.  You may elect to not participate in the directory by updating your profile.

ACS may use information about use of the Website and aggregated information about you and other visitors to our Website in order to improve our Website and develop content and services that may be of interest to you and for its other business purposes.

**III. Security Measures Taken to Protect Personally Identifiable Information**

ACS uses firewalls, vulnerability scans, and secure server encryption technology to protect personally identifiable information. ACS also employs internal physical and technologic security measures to detect and block unauthorized intrusions to its computer systems.  However, while we employ reasonable security measures to protect your personal information, please be aware that no method of electronic transmission is completely infallible, and we cannot guarantee its absolute safety. 

**IV. Information Sharing with Third Parties**

Limited personally identifiable information we request from you (namely, your name and home or office address) is occasionally sold to third parties, generally for educational programs. For example, the list of registrants to a Clinical Congress may be sold to exhibitors to the Clinical Congress. Moreover, personally identifiable information is occasionally shared with third parties so that these parties can send you promotional material about goods and services offered by the ACS or the third parties.

We may also share your personal information with our authorized service providers that perform certain services on our behalf.  These services may include providing customer service, performing business and sales analysis, and supporting our Website functionality, other features offered through our Website.  These service providers may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions but are not authorized to share or use such information for any other purposes. 

We may also provide your information to third parties to accomplish the purpose for which the information was submitted, such as providing your personally identifiable information to credit card processors to process a purchase.

We may also transfer user or customer information, including personally identifiable information, in connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale. 

We may disclose specific information in response to a valid court order, subpoena, government investigation, or as otherwise required by law, to enforce our Website policies, or to protect our or others' rights, property, or safety.  We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we, in good faith, believe to be unlawful.  We may share information to prevent illegal uses of the Website, or defend ourselves against third-party claims.  We may also share information with companies assisting in fraud protection or investigation.  We do not provide information to these agencies or companies for marketing or commercial purposes.

**V. Updating Contact Information and Opt-Out Choices**

ACS enables users of its Website and interactive educational products to update contact information and to opt out of the collection of personally identifiable information or particular communications or services by e-mail, telephone, or regular mail. Please use the contact information listed below. Due to production, mailing, and system timelines, it may take some time to process your request.  In addition, we may still use your information to communicate with you for other purposes, such as for customer service.
