# Privacy Policy at Faucet.com

### Information Collection & Use

Faucet.com is the sole owner of the information collected on its Web sites. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others. Faucet.com collects information from our customers at several different points on our Web sites including the order and quote pages. This information is used for the sole purpose of providing you the best possible service when requesting information or ordering products.

When you place an order, we request contact and credit card information. This information is used strictly for billing purposes and to successfully complete and fill orders. If we should have trouble processing an order, the contact information is used to get in touch with you.

### Security

Faucet.com takes strong precautions to protect your information both online and offline. We use a variety of technical solutions to make shopping safe at our Web sites. Your information is encrypted and is protected by industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software. While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also protect your information offline. All of your customer information is maintained in a restricted section. Only those of our employees who need the information to perform a specific job function (for example, customer service representatives) are granted access to personally identifiable data. See our Security Center for more details.

### Cookies

Our Web sites use "cookies", small pieces of data stored on your computer and delivered through your Web browser. Most, if not all, e-commerce merchants now use cookies. By using this technology we can provide you with an enhanced shopping experience. It is possible for you to turn off cookies in your Web browser. If you do this, you can still browse our Web sites, but we will not be able to provide you with a more personalized shopping experience or accept online orders from you. Please call us at 800-444-5783 if you would like more information or if you would prefer to place your order over the phone.

### Newsletters

If you wish to subscribe to our newsletters, which may contain promotional and sale information, we ask for information such as name and e-mail address. Every newsletter we send includes easy-to-use removal instructions and complies with all Federal CAN-SPAM regulations for commercial e-mailers.
