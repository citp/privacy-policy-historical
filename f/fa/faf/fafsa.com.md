Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.

We use the information you provide about yourself when subscribing to our service only to complete the FAFSA financial aid application.  We do not share this information with outside parties except the U.S. Department of Education's (DOE) Central Processing System (CPS) who then transmits the FAFSA results via DOE software (EDExpress) to school financial aid administrators you request the information be sent.

We use email addresses to answer the email we receive and to notify you that your FAFSA has been submitted and to provide helpful reminder notices about the renewal FAFSA process. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with or sold to outside parties.

We may use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that _X_ number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that _Y_ number of men and _Z_ number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. Read more about our [security measures](https://web.archive.org/web/20051210062958id_/http%3A//www.fafsa.com/ssl.htm).

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.  We are in the business to assist students and parents obtain financial aid for college.  Our youngest student customers are age 16.

You will receive a copy of the information submitted on your financial aid applications (called an Application Print Report).  You will also receive a Student Aid Report (SAR) from the Federal Student Aid Programs which is the primary document to use to make changes or [corrections](https://web.archive.org/web/20051210062958id_/http%3A//www.fafsa.com/corrections.htm) to your FAFSA record.  

You may correct factual errors in your maintained personally identifiable information by contacting our experts at 1.800.750.3446, option 1 or via email at [ support@fafsa.com](mailto:support@sfas.com). You may also make changes to your FAFSA record on a 4-page Student Aid Report (SAR) as noted above.  The student will also receive an Acknowledgment form from the College Scholarship Service (CSS) if you requested that we complete the CSS PROFILE application for you. For more information about making changes to your SAR, visit our web site at [ http://www.fafsa.com/sar.htm](https://web.archive.org/web/20051210062958id_/http%3A//www.fafsa.com/sar.htm) or contact the Federal processing center (CPS) at 1.800.433.3243. You may also request a 4-page SAR on which corrections may be made by calling 1.800.433.3243.

To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.  This is done by verifying the student's social security number and date of birth.

Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies, please feel free to [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20051210062958id_/http%3A//www.fafsa.com/contact.htm).
